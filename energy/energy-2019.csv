11397893,2019-12-30,"The internationally recognized Libyan government based in Tripoli and led by Faiez Serraj has denied the presence of any Syrian fighters taking part on its side in the Tripoli fighting. This comes ahead of the planned meeting between Turkey's Erdogan and Russia's Putin to discuss the Libya question.

The statement comes as the fighting, which was launched by Khalifa Hafter back in April, and airstrikes continue on the outskirts of Tripoli with both sides claiming successes. What is clear, as confirmed by UNSMIL's condemnation, is that civilians seem to be bearing the brunt of the fighting.

The denial comes after videos were circulated on social media purporting to show Syrian fighters taking part in the fighting against the Hafter-led Libyan National Army and its allies on the outskirts of Tripoli.

The pro-Hafter media alleged that these fighters were Turkish aligned militias transported by Turkey from Syria to Libya to help the forces defending Tripoli. They claimed this was part of the effort by Turkey to support the Tripoli Faiez Serraj government.

Libya-Turkey agreement

This comes on the back of the agreement between the Tripoli government and the Turkish government permitting the later to send troops to Libya to help the Tripoli government. This, in turn, was in response to allegations that the Hafter forces were backed by Russian fighters from the Wagner Group and various sub-Saharan mercenaries reported at over 2,000 strong.

It will be recalled that on 19 December, the Tripoli Government of National Accord (GNA) announced that it had activated the 27 November military agreement with Turkey under which the Turks are to provide military support to it. The Turkish parliament ratified the agreement on 21 December.

On 10 December Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had said that Turkish troops would be sent if the GNA were to request it. On 26 December, Erdogan appear to claim that the GNA had now requested troops and that they would go in early January after a bill was put to the Turkish parliament for approval.

That would be around 8 January, the same day that Russian President Putin is due in Turkey for talks on Libya.

However, speaking in Tunis also on 26 December, GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha said that no GNA request had been made as yet. He also said that an official request for military support would be made if the situation escalated.

There is now much anticipation of Erdogan-Putin meeting and a possible confrontation between Turkish troops and the Russians employed by the Wagner Group fighting in the Tripoli offensive for the LNA.

There is speculation as to whether Turkey and Russia would come to a deal to prevent their forces fighting each other in Tripoli as they had done in Syria. Equally, there is speculation that Russia will sacrifice Hafter in return for prioritizing higher strategic geopolitical interests with Turkey.

Greek reaction

Greek anger at the GNA's recognition of Turkey's eastern Mediterranean Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) has seen Athens effectively breaking ties with the GNA and instead stepping up its ties with Hafter's LNA and the allied eastern House of Representatives (HoR) and the eastern-based Interim Government of Abdullah Thinni.

On 22 December, after Greece had earlier expelled the GNA's ambassador in Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias had talks in Benghazi, with Haftar. Also at the meeting was Christodoulos Lazaris who was appointed as Greece's Special Envoy for Libya during the visit to Athens on 12 December by the HoR's president, Ageela Saleh.

According to LNA reports, at the Benghazi meeting Haftar proposed a Greek-Egyptian-LNA naval alliance in the eastern Mediterranean against Turkey. According to the same reports, Athens and Cairo agreed to this.

So far there has been no confirmation from Cairo or Athens. After his meeting in Benghazi, Dendias flew to Cairo for further talks on Libya with the Egyptian foreign minister, then on to Cyprus for talks there.

Meanwhile, the Thinni government's foreign minister, Abdelhady Alhweij, has claimed that Athens now accepts his government is the sole legitimate one. So far, there has been no statement to that effect from Athens; but in reality, that seems to be the case.

Dendias' Benghazi visit has been condemned by the GNA as a violation of a UN resolutions recognising it as Libya's sole government.

Regional escalation

The prospect of the Libyan conflict going regional is taking a step closer to reality.

While Haftar talks of an LNA-Egyptian-Greek naval alliance, in Tunis on 26 December, Bashagha said that a coalition of Libya, Turkey, Algeria and Tunisia had been formed.

The Tunisian authorities subsequently denied this. Nonetheless, it needs to be remembered that Tunisia has traditionally worked with whoever is in power in Tripoli.

The reasons were pragmatic. Tunisia needs to keep good relations with whoever is in power to its immediate east. There are economic reasons too: a significant amount of Tunisian exports go to western Libya.

Bashagha's statement should be seen as reflecting a new political reality. It came after the Turkish President made an unexpected visit to Tunis on 25 December for talks with Saied and other Tunisia officials both on Libya and closer Turkish-Tunisian ties. Erdogan said he discussed a possible ceasefire in Libya with Saied.

The new easier procedure means Libyans under 18 and over 55 no longer need a visa to enter Turkey.

Turkey reintroduced visas for Libyans in 2015 as the security situation in Libya deteriorated. Previously Libyans did not need a visa to travel to Turkey.

It restarted issuing visas from the capital Tripoli in 2017 where previously they could only be applied for from its consulate in Misrata.

The move is seen as part of the wider move of closer relations by the Turkish government and the internationally recognized Libyan government in Tripoli led by Faiez Serraj.

On 7 Nov. 7 Turkey and the Serraj government agreed two separate and controversial Memorandums of Understanding. The first was on military cooperation and the the second was on the maritime boundaries of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The latter allowed Turkey the right to drill for oil and gas in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Following the military cooperation deal, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that Turkey would consider sending troops to Libya if the Serraj government made such a demand.

11397895,2019-11-19,"Libya's Faiez Serraj-aligned Interior Ministry yesterday called upon the international community to prosecute Khalifa Hafter, in his role as commander of his Libyan National Army (LNA), for the air strike on a biscuit factor yesterday that killed 7 and injured 19. The Interior Ministry statement also called for the prosecution of China's Wing Loong drone manufacturer for supplying its drones used in the attack.

Meanwhile, in New York, Serraj's Foreign Minister Mohamed Siala addressed the Security Council in which he stressed that the crime of targeting a biscuit factory in the Wadi Al-Rabea suburb of Tripoli, which killed Libyan, Egyptian and African citizens, is a war crime by all standards and that the killings and abuse were carried out by a group of ''terrorists belonging to Haftar's militias''.

Commenting on the incident to the UN Security Council, UNSMIL head Ghassan Salame said ""I am angry and sad to report to you that today there was another mass civilian casualty event. A biscuit factory in the Wadi Rabi'a neighbourhood of Tripoli was hit by an air strike, according to early information. The attack has caused what we currently believe to be ten fatalities and over 35 injuries. It appears that the majority of the dead were migrants, but that at least two were Libyans. Regardless of whether the attack deliberately targeted the factory or was an indiscriminate attack, it may constitute a war crime. We are working to verify the facts and will update you accordingly"".

Siala also added that the continued aggression of Haftar's militias on the capital Tripoli was caused by international silence and the division of the Security Council on the Libyan issue, calling on the Security Council to take a unified stand against this aggression.

Siala wondered what the Security Council wanted from the legitimate government of the country? Is it intended to stand idly by and not defend the institutions of the legitimate state, stressing that his government is defending its legitimate institutions is a natural right guaranteed by all international laws. He also called on the Security Council to consider how Haftar's militias were able to get all their arsenal of arms under the Security Council's arms embargo and that those who should be held accountable are Hafter's militias, not the internationally recognized government of Libya.

The Minister called on the withdrawal of Hafter's militias and the return to their places before 4 April attack, in addition to obliging the countries involved in Libya to immediately stop any actions that would affect the political process, especially neighbouring countries, in any dialogue including the Berlin process.

Libya's Minister of Transport aligned to the Faiez Serraj internationally recognized Libyan government, Milad Matoug, met the the Mayor of Nalut Municipality, Abdulwahab Salem Al-Hajjam, at his Tripoli office last Thursday.

The meeting continues the new growing trend in Libya of regional decentralization which is being pushed by the Serraj government. The trend means that increasingly, regions are taking the initiative in local development.

The Ministry and Nalut Municipality reported that at the meeting Mayor Al-Hajjam made a number of proposals on the development of the Libyan-Tunisian Wazen land border crossing, the development of the Nalut airstrip and the maintenance of the land route between Nalut and Wazen border crossing.

Nalut is culturally an Amazigh town located 272 km or three-and-a-quarter hours' drive south west of Tripoli on the other side of the Nefusa Western Mountains and only 58 km annd an hour's drive from the Wazen-Dehiba Libyan-Tunisian land border.

The Nalut Mayor asked the Transport Ministry to include these proposed development projects in its proposed 2019-2020 plan and budget in view of the importance of these projects, and particularly the development of the border crossing, which the Mayor saw as providing a national service to all Libyans.

The Wazen border crossing has often taken on greater significance from time to time since the 2011 revolution whenever the main Ras Jdair land crossing has had problems. It has currently been closed down by the Tunisian authorities and has been experiencing a go slow process for months.

On the other hand, in view of the distance to the main coastal urban centres, Nalut is keen to upgrade its tiny airstip into a small or back up airport to improve transport to Tripoli - especially for medical and other emergencies.

The Mayor also updated the Minister on the municipality's improvement work of services at the Wazen border crossing as its initiative in assisting the central Libyan authorities in completing other related projects, the costs of which could not be covered by the municipal.

In response to these proposals, the Minister instructed the competent authorities of his Ministry to form a working group and conduct a field visit to the city of Nalut to study these proposals and develop a workplan for its to implementation.

The Minister recalled the recent decision by his government to establish a centre for the management and operation of all of Libya's land border crossings. This new body will be in charge of all matters related to land border crossings akin to the role played by the Airports and Seaports authorities.

11397899,2019-09-27,"In his speech to the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, Faiez Serraj, the internationally recognized head of Libya's Tripoli-based government blamed external interference for extending Libya's current war.

He accused Khalifa Hafter, commander of the opposition Libyan National Army (LNA) forces, of carrying out a failed coup in an attempt to militarize the Libyan state and said he held all those who support him morally and legally responsible for the crimes and deaths committed.

Serraj pointed out the ''serious violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, as happened with HoR member Ms. Siham Sirgiwa and other national figures, and suppression of opinions, and elimination of political opposition'' in areas controlled by Hafter.

He renewed his request to put Khalifa Haftar on the international sanctions list and to hold his supporters accountable and he called on the United Nations to urgently send an investigative mission to document the various serious violations. He also called on the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to speed up its investigations in crimes committed in Libya.

Serraj challenged Hafter's narrative and pretext for launching his 4 April attack on Tripoli of ''liberating'' the capital from ''militias, terrorists and Islamists'', and called on Libyans in the east of the country to counter it. He insisted that the real narrative is a civilian democratic state versus Hafter's military state.

He reassured his support for a political solution and dialogue to Libya's problem, but repeated that he will never sit down again with the ''war criminal'' Haftar as he did not regard him as a partner for peace.

Serraj pointed out his decentralization policies to address regional grievances, as well as his economic reform policies. But he also alleged that he carried out ""security reforms'' in the form of some Demilitarization, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) of militias.

The letter, entitled ""Outstanding Projects on the Way to Completion,"" referred to the resumption of numerous hospital maintenance projects nationwide, some of which were discontinued more than a decade ago, adding that ''low-income people are legally covered by the right to health care and free education''.

It added that health does not mean that these services lack the basics and standards of quality and that the current government is determined to change this impression and these sterile rules.

''Our goal is to achieve social justice among all segments of society. We will seek that the simple citizen receives the best services and there will be no difference between the simple citizen and those who have the ability to buy health services from the private sector'', he said.

The Deputy Minister revealed the ""significant"" difficulties faced in reforming the health sector, saying: ""We faced the major resistance and those who doubted that we could reach the goal. We also faced those who were afraid of taking responsibility for the delinquents to sleep and escape. But we have made our intention and determination clear to reach the goal and achieve what we can with a collective, structured institutional effort based on short, medium and long-term plans, and it is no exaggeration to say that we have confronted those who deliberately obstructed any successes.""

""Slogans without real content will not provide any result for the citizen, but what will happen radically at all levels is the real response and great motivation, while recognizing that many aspects need more effort, perseverance and strategic planning, especially since they were born. Many years of negligence and apparent negligence cannot be remedied immediately."", added the Deputy Minister.

He thanked many in the health sector for their unified efforts, but he also thanked the Audit Bureau, for fighting corruption in the health sector which helped launch the reform programme on a correct footing.

The Health Ministry then listed a number of projects it is on the verge of completing in different medical specialities.

It revealed that it would soon announce the completion of the first phase of maintenance and development projects within all hospitals in the capital Tripoli, which have not received as much attention as the hospitals are now witnessing.

Abu Sleem Accident and Emergency hospital

Children's Hospital in Tripoli

The Children's Hospital in Tripoli is also having maintenance of the entire building by removing the old building and maintaining the departments of childcare, shelter and ambulance.

The Ministry also reported maintenance work in other important facilities such as the Tripoli Reference Laboratory, the Dialysis Centre on al-Shat, and al-Razi Hospital for Psychiatric and Neurological Diseases.

The new health improvements and reforms come as part of the wider nationwide health reform programme initiated by the Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council /Government of National Accord in October 2017.

Part of this reform process is the formation of the National Centre of Health System Reform (NCHSR) as the driver of health reform. It is the child of a long health review and reform process that started with the 2012 Tripoli health conference and its subsequent recommendations. It recommended that an autonomous health reform committee (NCHSR) be formed to carryout root review and reform of Libya's ailing health sector.

Headed by Dr Samir Sagar, the NCHSR operates in collaboration with the Health Ministry, and sprang out of the Libya Health System Strengthening Programme (LHSS), set up between the Libyan authorities and the European Union to reform Libya's health sector.

· ensure full funding for a service that is free to patients at the point of use;

· involve the private sector;

· have a healthcare service in line with international standards;

· decentralise;

· have a service where health workers, whether in the private or public sectors, are properly paid for their work;

· develop a master plan to achieve universal health care in Libya.

11397902,2019-08-22,"Faiez Serraj, head of Libya's internationally recognized Presidential Council and Government of National Accord, held an expanded meeting yesterday to discuss increased investment in the country's oil sector.

The meeting was attended by the Ministers of Planning and Finance as well as the Governor of the Tripoli Central Bank of Libya (CBL), the Chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), the head of the Audit Bureau, and the head of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA).

The meeting dealt with increased investment in the oil sector and the implementation of plans to develop it more effectively to achieve additional financial returns to Libya that would contribute to the revival of the national economy in its various fields.

This is with the aim to improve and develop the public services sector and implement development and reconstruction projects in various regions of Libya.

The Serraj government reported that there was extensive discussion on an additional funding provision for the NOC in the coming period to implement this vision.

It also reported that it was agreed to set a legal budget to start investing in the oil sector which is the primary source of revenue for the country.

This is so as to enable the NOC to raise production, increase export rates and perform its overall tasks for production, exploration, refining and transportation of crude oil and products - as part of its development plans in the coming years.

It is noteworthy that the LIA manages an investment portfolio in the field of oil and gas and owns shares, assets and companies in this field and has many partnerships in exploration projects with the largest international companies.

After participating in the above meeting, the LIA confirmed that it ""seeks to build a real strategic alliance with the NOC in order to increase production rates and continue exploration projects"".

It will also be recalled that the NOC has been asking for an increased maintenance and investment budget for years - without much success.

It has argued that since oil is the overwhelming source of revenue for Libya (92 percent of 2019 budget) in the short and medium term, the Tripoli government should allocate it an increased budget in order to secure more oil production, exports and hence revenues.

This is especially so since the non-oil economy is stalling badly due to a myriad of reasons including the country's lack of security.

However, the political instability of the country and weak central and institutional control has meant the majority of Libya's budget is spent on state-sector salaries (58 percent) and subsidies - rather than on investment and development projects (5.3 percent).",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli']",Serraj government discussing further funding for NOC to activate Libyan economy,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/08/22/serraj-government-discussing-further-funding-for-noc-to-activate-libyan-economy/,None,

The HoR also reported that a number of them stressed the (Libyan National) army's actions in the fight against ""terrorism and armed militias"" in the west of the country and the ""inability of the Presidential Council"" to act freely as it has become a ""hostage to the armed militias"" in Tripoli.

The HoR members also denounced the Turkish-Qatari intervention in Libyan affairs and called on the United Nations to intervene in this violation of the sovereignty of a Member State of the United Nations and the violation of UN Security Council resolutions.

11397907,2019-07-01,"The six Turkish nationals detained in Ajdabiya, eastern Libya, were released today after Turkey threatened military action.

The six turned out to be sailors working on a Libyan ship and not military personnel, as had been reported.

The Turkish nationals were detained after eastern Libya authorities cut all ties with Turkey on Friday, threatening to arrest Turkish citizens and target all Turkish interests in Libya, including flights and shipping.

The announcement by eastern Libya came after their Libyan National Army (LNA) forces led by Khalifa Hafter lost the strategic western mountain city of Gharian to a surprise attack by Tripoli-aligned forces.

The Tripoli forces represent the internationally recognized government led by Faiez Serraj.

The mainly eastern based LNA forces accuse Turkey of supporting Tripoli in its war effort against them.

The LNA had launched an attack on Tripoli on 4 April claiming to intend to liberate it from terrorists and militias.

On Saturday, Libya's internationally-recognized parliament based in the eastern city of Tobruk, the House of Representatives (HoR), had condemned what it called Turkish ""intervention"" and Turkey's ""declaration of war"" on Libya through its participation in the operations of the ""extremists militias"" by fighting against the LNA and through its supply of arms and logistical support.

The HoR also noted the ""sorry silence"" of the UN and international community on the matter.

The HoR said that the support of Turkey and Qatar for the extremist, terrorist militias of Tripoli will not stop it from pursuing and cleansing Libya of terrorism, extremism and the public money-grabbing, people-smuggling militias - as they did in Benghazi, the oilfields, Derna, south Libya and western Libya.

HoR condemns: ""liquidation"" of LNA war prisoners, injured and Turkish participation in fighting

11397908,2019-06-21,"In a long and exclusive interview with the eastern-based The Libyan Address Journal, Khalifa Hafter put forward his vision for Libya and repeated his motivation for launching his military attack on Tripoli on 4 April.

Hafter gives very few interviews, and even less to Libyan media. However, it seems he was keen in this wide-ranging interview to put forward his vision beyond the war on Tripoli. He gave some insights into his thinking and his reading of the Paris, Palermo and Abu Dhabi meetings.

Hafter insisted that there needs to be a political solution and that hutcomes of e was a democrat and that he wanted to hold democratic elections - but only after ridding Tripoli of its ''Islamists and militias''.

On Faiez Serraj's peace initiative he says it lacks ''seriousness'' and does not address the ''root causes of the crisis''.

On the European position on Libya, Hafter said Europe's position remains important for him. He said Europe should understand the longing of the Libyan people for changing their reality, and for exiting this crisis, and that such change begins with ''the war on terror, the dismantling of militias, and the ending of this phase of the hijacked authority (referring to the Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National Accord) that lacks proper authorization by the people''.

However, Hafter said he did not see this changing of Libyans' reality happening purely through the military operation launched on Tripoli. He insisted that Libya's solution must be through the political track, and with the participation of all Libyans. The Libyan people will find solutions for using dialogue and discussion, through peaceful, political, and democratic means, he explained.

The military operation, he continued, takes aim at ''inexecrable realities that could not be addressed by any other means''. These include ''the presence and spreading of terrorist leaders, and their recruitment activities through cells inside Tripoli, the presence and spreading of militias, and their control over the funds that belong to the Libyan people at the Central Bank of Libya, as well as their practice of highway robbery, kidnapping, blackmail, the growing of activities by criminal groups, organized-crime gangs who trade in human beings, and the smuggling of oil and fuels, and also the presence of groups of politicized Islam that sabotage political life and spoil its atmosphere, and even implement foreign agendas that conflict with the interests of the Libyan people.

This is the part that we aim at with our military operation'', he said.

On the Tripoli fighting operations, he said Libyans should not to pay attention to the rumours that claim that we may withdraw or even think of stopping at this stage. ''Military operations will NOT stop before we accomplish all our objectives. After finishing the military task in Tripoli, (his forces) will be devoted to the protection of borders, shores, and skies. The atmosphere for political work and discourse, with all its details will be more conducive. Such work and discourse will then have better circumstances for success. That contrasts with the circumstance of the previous eight years. The military operation will result in the removal of the factors that led to the failure of the political track, and that led to all the economic, social, legal, and security catastrophes''.

After liberating Tripoli, ''we will enter a transitional period that is, this time, both clear and disciplined. It is important that during this transitional period several basic tasks are accomplished, in order to prepare the ground for the permanent phase''. This involves ''the dismantling of all militias, disarming them, and giving guarantees to those who cooperate in that regard. The dismantling of all bodies (the Presidency Council, the Government of National Accord and the High State Council) generated by the Skhirat Accord (the Libyan Political Agreement signed in the Moroccan city of Skhirat in 2015), which has not only expired and failed in finding an exit from the crisis but actually created several other crises''.

Hafter continued, adding that the next phase is ''a phase that is permanent and normalized, and upon which the state can stabilize, so it can launch into reconstruction, development, and the removal of the debris of long years of stagnation''.

Amongst the tasks of such a phase are ''the formation of a new constitutional committee, and a proposed referendum law, rebalancing the oil sector and its revenues, addressing the challenges facing people, and making their lives easier, and especially addressing the liquidity crisis, and commencing the unification and proper management of state institutions, after years of chaotic divisiveness caused by previous bodies, through their illegal struggle for power, and their reneging on commitments, and their being manipulated by militias from before and after the 'Fajr Libya' (Libya Dawn 2014 Tripoli coup) terrorist operation that was launched by the Muslim Brotherhood. The whole world now knows that it was that operation that divided the institutions of the state, and led to the catastrophes that Libya has been suffering''.

''We will have a transitional phase that will be managed by a national unity government'', continued Hafter, ''that will immediately start working upon liberating Tripoli. And if, for any temporary logistical and security reasons, it has difficulties, it may also start working from any other city like Benghazi, or any other stable and secure city in the West, East, or South, until Tripoli is ready for moving in. As you know, we do not discriminate between cities or regions. We see a single and unified Libya''.

Asked about those who doubt Hafter's real intentions behind attacking Tripoli and accuse him of being a Qaddafi-like dictator in disguise, he said ''They should first raise doubts about those who flipped on democracy using arms and came back to power through the militias of 'Fajr Libya', duly designated as terrorist by the Parliament. They occupied the capital and imposed a government with the force of arms.

''It is more appropriate'', he continued, ''for such people to raise doubts about the Presidential Council that refused to hand over authority after the Skhirat Accord expired three times, and after the passing of many legal judgments against it and against its decrees, because it has no legal status, and its alliance with militias to stay in power.''

''They should raise doubts'', he added ''about those who empower terrorist groups and militias and grant them safe havens and money and allow them to destroy the state and its institutions. As for the (Libyan National) Army (LNA), it is the same Army that protected the last elections in 2014, and that committed to all international initiatives regarding new elections. The Army is the one who will guarantee and protect the establishment of the new Libyan state, God willing. It is not the army who failed to meet its commitments regarding elections which were supposed to happen in 2018, and which were then postponed to the beginning of 2019''.

''No, it was the Presidential Council that withheld funding of the (High National) Election Commission (HNEC), as per its chairman's own statements, and that also failed to protect it and allowed it to be destroyed by terrorists. It also objected to the Referendum Law and created difficult predicaments regarding constitutional foundations. At other times, it used the excuse of security circumstances and a host of other excuses that they kept coming up with''.

Hafter claimed that ''Elections were our demand from the beginning and we agreed to them, and we demanded them in the Abu Dhabi I and II meetings, in Paris I and II, and in Palermo Italy as a solution for the legitimacy crisis. This was the demand of the majority of Libyans, as per opinion polls. But, what happened? What happened is that this government which we regarded as an enlightened government of national accord, returned to where its militias were, and where the non-constitutional and so called 'State Council' (controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood, lately classified by the Parliament as a terrorist organization) was, and reneged on everything we had agreed upon. In summary, they are the obstructers of the process using all sorts of chaotic excuses, as explained.

On the international position on Libya, Hafter said ''The international stance is largely supportive of the Army (LNA), directly and indirectly. Those who do not support us, still sent us assurances that they understand the stance of the Army and its movements'' and that his ideas for the phase beyond the liberation of Tripoli, ''do not conflict with the common interest of these countries with Libya and do not in any way obstruct them''

On the position of regional and neighbouring countries, Hafter said ''We believe that, day by day, they have started to understand the nature of the movements of the Army, and its contribution in supporting the people in their striving to exit from the current suffocating situation to a transitional phase, and then to a permanent phase that ends all suffering''.

On Faiez Sarraj's latest peace initiative Hafter said that he did ''not believe that he (Serraj) has anything to say. He is a shaken man, and his decision is not in his hand. I have experienced dealing with him and have come to know him well over the past several years, and I have talked to him directly, as you know. Truly, he does not know what he wants, and is not able to sign any agreement. He always unconsciously gives you the impression that he is terrified of something unknown, intensely and to an indescribable extent''.

''Anyway'', he continued, ''the initiative, in addition to lacking any seriousness and any clauses that address the causes of the crisis, does not actually belong to Sarraj, but is merely an echo of the repetitive discourse of Ghassan Salame. Initiatives have no meaning unless they are brave and carry clear clauses that address the causes of the crisis and its very roots. Therefore, his initiative is of no value and our response to it is the same as our response to what Salame has said before''.

''I repeat'', Hafter stressed, ''we are not against political solutions, nor against the democratic process, nor against elections. On the contrary, we see elections as the best path forward, as in all countries of the world. The ABC of democracy is arbitration exclusively through the ballot box, not arbitration through an alleged 'consensus' that has been forcibly imposed upon Libyans in the lobbies of hotels. We believe all these values and institutions of a civil and modern state cannot live in the shadow of terrorist control and groups like Al-Qaida, the (disbanded) Libya Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), the Muslim Brotherhood, militias and gangs of organized crime, smuggling, kidnapping, and the predators of public funds''.

On UNSMIL head Ghassan Salame, Hafter said that he respected him in general. ''However, lately, his information seems truncated and he does not give the Army its due. His reports to the Security Council and some of the confusing reports of his mission make us believe that cooperating with him is of no benefit. I frankly also told him that I am still hoping that cooperation between us can continue and develop towards prospects of resolving the crisis, and that I would not like to treat him like previous envoys''.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Paris', 'Skhirat', 'Palermo', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Morocco', 'Benghazi', 'Italy']",Hafter attempts to market his justification for Tripoli attack - assures of his democratic credentials,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/06/21/hafter-attempts-to-market-his-justification-for-tripoli-attack-assures-of-his-democratic-credentials/,None,
11397909,2019-05-22,"From 1 February to 31 March 2019, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) documented civilian casualties - 20 deaths and 69 injuries - during the conduct of hostilities across Libya, it says in a report released today.

These figures preceded the attack by Khalifa Hafter on Tripoli which started on 4 April. The latest World Health Organization figures for that period are 510 deaths and 2,467 wounded. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its last bulletin that since the 4 April fighting started there have been 29 confirmed civilian deaths and 126 wounded.

It is noteworthy that even the UN, with its huge budget and access to member state intelligence, was often unable to attribute deaths or casualties during the insecurity in Libya.

For the 1 February to 31 March period, the latest UN report says that victims included 12 men, four women, and four children killed, and 60 men, two women, and seven children injured. Most civilian casualties were caused by shelling (11 killed and 51 injured), followed by gunfire (nine killed and 15 injured) and explosive remnants of war (ERW, three injured).

The report says that it documented civilian casualties in Derna (seven killed and 30 injured), Benghazi (one killed and 13 injured), Murzuq (10 killed and 26 injured), and Sabratha (two killed).

UNSMIL's report also includes casualties from other possible violations of international humanitarian law and violations or abuses of international human rights law in Benghazi, Sabratha and Murzuq.

Casualties from unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO)

On 4 February 2019, three boys aged between 9 and 15 years, were injured when an unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) detonated in Benghazi's Kuweifiya area as they were collecting scrap metal.

Derna

Fighting between the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the Derna Protection Force (DPF), previously known as the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council, resulted in at least seven deaths and 30 injuries to civilians. Most civilian casualties were caused by indiscriminate fire and unguided weapons, such as artillery and mortars, as the LNA increased its operations to gain control of Derna's Old City. While it remains difficult to verify casualty figures, UNSMIL received the following reports:

On 2 February 2019, at least four women and three infants were killed as the LNA shelled Derna's Old City. On 9 February 2019, it was reported that 30 civilians, including one woman, were injured when the LNA shelled Derna's Old City.

Southern Libya

The LNA and local affiliates pursued their advance in southern Libya. On 1 February 2019, LNA-affiliated forces moved from Sabha towards the southwestern town of Ghudwa to attack Tebu forces from the Murzuq's Southern Protection Force and Chadian armed elements. UNSMIL recorded the following civilian casualties during the period:

On 3 February 2019, four civilians were killed and 19 others injured after an LNA airstrike in Murzuq.

On 17 February 2019, also in Murzuq, the LNA launched an airstrike at night, hitting Zawiat Zala's block 17, killing at least one male civilian and injuring two children.

On 4 March 2019, one male civilian was injured when an armed group fired at houses in Umm al-Araneb's Project 5 neighbourhood.

On 5 March 2019, unidentified armed men opened fire with a rocket-propelled grenade against a group of civilians watching a football game, killing at least three young boys and injuring four others near the Murzuq football field.

On 9 March 2019, unidentified gunmen opened fire and killed a civilian as he was driving from Murzuq to Traghen.

Incidents against civilian infrastructure

On 9 February 2019, an LNA airstrike hit the runway of the al-Feel oil field in southwestern Libya, damaging the facility. No civilian casualties were reported. On 13 February 2019, foreign workers present at the al-Feel oil field were evacuated over concerns for their security; local workers remained in place.

On 12 February 2019, the LNA entered the Sharara oil field, further to negotiations with Petroleum Facilities Guards. On 17 February 2019, the LNA issued a directive ordering the handover of the oil field to the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and lifting the force majeure status to allow for the resumption of oil production. However, the NOC maintained its position that the force majeure status would not be lifted as long as the security of its employees was not guaranteed.

On 6 March 2019, in Tripoli, unidentified armed men opened fire against the Suq al-Ahad grocery market. No casualties were reported, although the building sustained some damage. The gunmen also blocked the market's main entrance and the headquarters of the neighbouring tax collection office .

On the same day, in Sirte, the Sirte Protection Force blocked access to the city's public facilities, including the electricity generating station, to protest against the GNA's failure to pay salaries for the last 14 months.

On 14 March 2019, in Gharyan, the al-Qarya armed group - recently affiliated to the LNA - attacked a governmental building near the municipal council in response to the detention of one of its battalion leaders in Tripoli. No casualties were reported, although some property damage was sustained.

On 16 March 2019, in Bani Walid, unidentified gunmen reportedly vandalized a historic building following a visit by the GNA Ministry of Culture.

On 30 March 2019, in Sirte, a home-made Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonated at the Kortoba's Mosque. The explosion resulted in property damage. No casualties were reported.

Attribution

The LNA and its affiliates are believed to be responsible for the casualties documented in southern Libya, including airstrikes against Murzuq.

UNSMIL was unable to determine with certainty which parties to the conflict caused the other civilian casualties reported during the period.

Casualties from other violations of international humanitarian law and violations or abuses of human rights

11397910,2019-05-22,"The Serraj Interior Minister, Fathi Bashagha, met with French ambassador, Béatrice le Fraper du Hellen, in Tunis yesterday to sign a number of security agreements (French embassy Tripoli).

France's ambassador to Libya, Béatrice le Fraper du Hellen met with Libya's Government of National Accord Interior Minister, Fathi Bashagha, in Tunis yesterday in a sign of rapprochement between the two countries.

The two countries had verged on a total diplomatic fallout as the internationally-recognized Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National Accord accused France of supporting Khalifa Hafter following his 4 April military attack on Tripoli.

France was accused of blocking any EU attempts to condemn Hafter as the aggressor and for calls for Hafter to withdraw to the status quo ante. France was also accused - together with Russia - of any UN Security Council condemnation of Hafter.

Relations reached a point where the Serraj government briefly threatened to use a bureaucratic technicality to block any French companies operating in Libya. The action was subsequently reversed.

In Tunis yesterday, the Serraj government announced that the two countries had agreed on ''several special security topics in the field of counter-terrorism, organized crime and civil defence, as well as economic crimes and money laundering''.

The meeting also took place, the Serraj government said, ''to prepare for the conclusion of security memorandums in the interests of the two countries''.

The Serraj administration reported that the French Ambassador expressed the ''gratitude ''of the French Government to the Government of National Accord as ''the legitimate government of Libya, and fully supported it as representing the Libyan people as a whole, which is the main legitimate source for the conclusion of conventions and laws with them''.

The French embassy in Tripoli, on the other hand, reported the meeting briefly as a ''Friendly and fruitful meeting between the Ambassador of France in Libya and the Libyan Minister of the Interior Bashagha to discuss the situation in Libya and reaffirm the importance of bilateral cooperation''.

It is not clear what carrots the French government offered the Serraj administration and why the Serraj government backtracked so much. More may be revealed over time.

11397911,2019-05-13,"Faiez Serraj, head of Libya's internationally recognized Presidency Council and Government of National Accord continued his European tour today in his efforts to end the Tripoli fighting started by Libyan National Army (LNA) commander Khalifa Hafter on 4 April.

Khalifa Hafter, meanwhile visited Egypt's president Sissi in Cairo.

After visiting Rome, Berlin, Paris and London last week, Serraj arrived in Brussels today where he met both Federica Mogherini, High Representative of EU Foreign Policy and Donald Tusk, President of the European Council. The visit by Serraj comes ahead of the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting today.

At the meeting, the Serraj government reported that Mogherini had reiterated the European Union's support for the internationally-recognized Libyan Government of National Accord, stressing that there was no military solution to the Libyan crisis, and the need to stop the attack on Tripoli and a return to the political track in accordance with Ghasan Salame's UNSMIL plan.

For his part, Serraj expressed his aspiration for a common European position which describes things as they really are, and which contributes practically to the saving of Libyan blood. He said that every day that passes increases the numbers of Libyan victims and expands the war which will not only affect Libya but the entire region.

Without naming Egypt, UAE or Saudi Arabia, which are widely perceived by a large swathe of the Libyan public to be supporting Hafter militarily, Serraj called on the European Union to intervene in order to stop the violations committed by ''some states'' by supplying the aggressor force (Hafter) with weapons, in clear violation of the Security Council resolution banning the supply of weapons to Libya. Serraj maintained that the Tripoli battle in reality is between those who wanted to militarize the state and those who want to uphold the civil state.

Serraj reiterated that any talk of a ceasefire must bring about the withdrawal of the aggressor forces (Hafter) and their return to where they came from.

In his meeting with Donald Tusk, Serraj outlined the position of his government and expressed his surprise by the Hafter attack on Tripoli as his government was preparing to hold the UN-brokered National Conference (Multaqa) in Ghadames.

Serraj stressed that his ''government forces'' were exercising their legitimate right to repel the treacherous aggression until it is defeated and demanded a common and just European position not equating between the aggressor and the victim.

Serraj added that the aim of Hafter's Tripoli attack was clear to all as an attempt to abort the political process and restore totalitarian rule to Libya, which he said would not happen. He stressed that the will of the people would prevail to build their desired civil state, a state of the rule of law and institutions.

Tusk was reported by the Libyan government stressing that Libya was a strategic partner of the EU, and that its stability was crucial to the security of the region in the southern Mediterranean and the Sahel region.

Tusk was also reported as saying that the attack on Tripoli threatened the peace process that had taken a long way to reach a settlement. He also stressed that the European Union would work to find a formula for a ceasefire and contribute to a peaceful and democratic solution within the framework of the United Nations.

Donald Tusk also tweeted that he had ''Discussed the situation in Libya with PM al-Serraj this morning. The EU calls on all parties to immediately implement a ceasefire. All parties should re-commit to the UN-facilitated political dialogue. There is no military solution.''

On the fighting front meanwhile, the battle lines remain largely unchanged as a stalemate seems to dominate.

The death and casualty toll continued to rise as the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the Tripoli armed conflict had now killed 454 people and wounded 2,154 people, including three ambulance workers whose vehicle was struck. The latest UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) report stated that there were 111 Health Sector verified civilian casualties, including 23 civilian deaths.

The Serraj side confirmed that the Hafter LNA had carried out air strikes on Thursday in Janzour, Wadi Rabea and at the Islamic Call Society headquarters off Swani Road and that back up troops were arriving in Tripoli from Misrata.

There were also LNA air strikes in Tajura and Zawia. The Tajura strike was claimed to have been conducted by a drone hitting an area with no clear military purpose. the Serraj aligned forces claimed it led to the injury of at least two civilians, including a child. The Zawia hit was claimed to be on a militia base there.

On the humanitarian side, OCHA confirmed on 8 May, a clearly marked armoured ambulance vehicle carrying the Director of Tripoli's Ambulance and Emergency Medical Services in the Twaisha area of Gaser Ben Ghasheer was hit in what it referred to as ''an apparent direct attack''. It confirmed that the hit injured two paramedics and left the Director in critical condition with the loss of both his legs in the attack.

OCHA said that this was ''the latest in an alarmingly high incidence of attacks on first responders and medical staff''. It reminded that since the beginning of the offensive in Tripoli, 4 health workers have been killed, 4 have been injured, 12 ambulances have been impacted and 2 health facilities were evacuated as a result of armed clashes, shelling and airstrikes.

These incidents, it said, further hamper the ability of already overstretched health services to provide vital assistance to civilians, including those inured as a result of armed conflict.

On 9 May, the Humanitarian Coordinator condemned the incident as a serious breach of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). WHO likewise condemned the incident in a statement on 9 May. It remined that all parties to the conflict are obligated to take constant care to spare civilians and civilian objects, including medical personnel and assets. Deliberate attacks on clearly marked medical transports constitute war crimes under International Human Rights Law (IHL).

The report revealed that approximately 62,700 persons have now fled their homes as a result of the armed conflict. About 3,900 new IDPs have been identified since 7 May. The majority of IDPs are staying in private accommodation, with friends and relatives or in rental accommodation, mainly in urban areas of Tripoli. Many IDPs have also moved to areas along the coastal line of Western Libya and the Nafusa mountains, while approximately 2,700 IDPs are hosted in collective shelters established by local authorities and first responders.

Up to date, the report said that 29 collective shelters have been set up, the majority of which are in schools with some others in hotels, resorts and university dorms. An increasing number of IDPs are being identified in areas further away from Tripoli, a trend which is likely to increase the radius in need of humanitarian assistance.

Over the night of 7-8 May, the report confirmed that airstrikes against a GNA compound in Tajura caused damage and injured two persons within the Tajura detention centre (DC) located in close proximity, in which some 564 refugees and migrants were detained at the time.

In a statement on 8 May, UNHCR called for all refugees and migrants in DCs in conflict areas to be immediately evacuated to safety. On 9 May, UNHCR transferred 228 individuals from Zawia (116 Individuals), Tajura (68 individuals) and Al Sabah (44 individuals) DCs to the UNHCR's Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF) in Tripoli. This leaves approximately 3,300 refugees and migrants trapped in DCs in areas exposed to or at risk of armed conflict and where access to food, water and healthcare are severely restricted due to the conflict.

The international humanitarian community, the report said, continues to call for these individuals to be immediately released and provided with safe shelter until their asylum claims can be processed or they can be provided with safe repatriation assistance for reunification with their families. The international humanitarian community likewise urgently reminds parties to the conflict of their obligations under IHL to refrain from positioning military assets in or near civilian objects, including places of detention.

The OCHA report goes on to explain that the conflict in and around Tripoli is making it increasingly difficult for assistance to reach people in need in other areas of the country, particularly in the southern region, where the recent conflict has exacerbated existing humanitarian concerns.

The disruption of transport of key goods, due to the presence of conflict and combatants along major trade routes is increasing the severity of already existing shortages. Reportedly, the report says, delivery of fuel to petrol stations in the south has ceased since the start of the conflict in Tripoli, leaving residents to resort to the black market and facing high price increases.

Access to food, gas cylinders for cooking, electricity, cash liquidity and health services are also reported to be restricted. Parties to the conflict have pulled some of their forces from the south to join the frontlines in around Tripoli, reportedly leading to increased lawlessness and security incidents, especially along the Jufra trade route, also contributing to the shortages in supplies of essential items, the report says.

Displaced and conflict-affected individuals, including refugees and migrants, face obstacles in meeting basic food needs due to disruption of supply chains, market closures and rising prices brought on by scarcity.

Conflict-affected individuals - including IDPs, refugees and migrants, and civilians trapped in conflict areas - have had their access to health care services severely disrupted. Injured civilians and persons with specific medical needs are in urgent need of medical assistance - assistance which is increasingly strained due to attacks impacting health workers and facilities.

The report also says that instances of kidnapping, forced disappearance and arrest of civilians (including IDPs) originally from the east of Libya (due to their perceived political affiliation) have been increasing.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Rome', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Brussels', 'London', 'Zawiya, Libya', 'Tajura', 'Cairo', 'Ghadames', 'Misrata', 'Saudi Arabia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Sabah']",Tripoli fighting continues as Serraj diplomatic tour reaches Brussels,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/05/13/tripoli-fighting-continues-as-serraj-diplomatic-tour-reaches-brussels/,None,

The EU ambassadors also reiterated their support for local elections being held across the country and called for full participation of Libyan women.

It called for a unified Libyan military with civilian oversight and less foreign interference asnd warned against human rights violations in conflicts across the country.

Here is the full text:

Following their joint meetings in Tripoli on 12 March, Ambassadors of the European Union and the Member States accredited to Libya travelled today to Benghazi for meetings with the General Commander of the Libyan National Army Khalifa Haftar, and with a Delegation of the House of Representatives led by the Head of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Yousef Al-Aghouri.

The main objective of the visit was for Ambassadors and representatives of the European Union, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden to reaffirm the EU's support to the efforts of UN SRSG Ghassan Salame towards ending the transitional phase which Libyans have been living through since the February revolution, and to urge all parties to rally behind these efforts to ensure the success of the National Conference which will convene in Ghadames next month.

At the end of the visit, the European Union Delegation issues the following statement in agreement with the EU Heads of Mission to Libya*:

""In our meetings today in Benghazi with Haftar and the House of Representatives, we reaffirmed the EU's unwavering support to the efforts of UN SRSG Ghassan Salamé and UNSMIL to broker a political agreement among Libyan stakeholders towards ending Libya's political transition. As Ambassadors accredited to the whole of Libya, we also came to Benghazi at this critical juncture to reaffirm to Libyans across all regions the EU's commitment to a close partnership with Libya as a united, stable, democratic and prosperous neighbour.

We welcome the announcement by SRSG Salame that the National Conference - which the European Union will support financially - will be convening next month in Ghadames bringing together all key stakeholders. We urged all our interlocutors, across the country and abroad, to seize this opportunity to end the current stalemate and usher in a period of stability and prosperity which the Libyan people deserve. We call upon all Libyan parties at this delicate phase to refrain from any incitement, especially through the media, and work towards defusing tension.

We commend the ongoing discussions between key stakeholders to end the transitional stage in Libya and reaffirm our support for holding fair and secure national elections, as soon as possible. The establishment of a stable, unified and inclusive government that can deliver basic services for all Libyans should be the absolute priority. We stress the vital importance of the female presence in leadership positions at all levels of the state and women's participation in political processes pursuant to UNSC resolution 1325.

An appropriate framework for effective local governance, based on successful municipal elections and a mechanism for a fair distribution of government revenues, remains a key pillar for the stabilization of Libya. We thus strongly support the announcement by the CCMCE that it will hold local elections in a number of municipalities in the next few weeks, and urge all actors to take the necessary steps to allow the holding of local elections by the CCMCE throughout the country.

We heed the call of the Libyan people for the restoration of security, and their desire to see unified security and military institutions, free from political, partisan and regional interference and subject to civilian and judicial oversight. In this context, the EU is committed to remain Libya's main partner in the security sector, through EU instruments including EUBAM and Member States bilateral assistance, for the benefit of Libyans in all regions.

The EU welcomes effective and rules-based action against terrorist groups and organised crime, in compliance with human rights and Libya's obligations under international law. However, we are concerned by reports of human rights and international humanitarian law violations around the country, including those that took place during recent military campaigns in the east and south as well as various ongoing violations perpetrated in western Libya. The EU calls for the perpetrators to be held accountable and urges our Libyan partners to uphold human rights in all circumstances. We also urge all relevant authorities to respect and protect the space of civil society organisations and journalists to carry out their work in freedom and safety.

The EU continues to support Libya in institution building, improving service delivery and community stabilisation, through projects and programmes, ongoing and committed, amounting to 431 million and implemented in all regions.

The Ambassadors also met with UN SRSG Ghassan Salame.

The joint visit of Ambassadors representing the European Union, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom allowed for an exchange of views on the political and security situation in the country and supporting efforts towards moving forward the political process aimed at ending the period of transition.

At the end of the visit, the European Union Delegation issues the following statement in agreement with the EU Heads of Mission to Libya:

""In our meetings today in Tripoli, we reaffirmed the EU's unwavering commitment to Libya's stability, democratic transition and prosperity. We are keen to develop with our Libyan neighbour a solid partnership based on shared interests and values.

We are fully behind the continued efforts of UN SRSG Ghassan Salamé and UNSMIL to secure a political agreement. We applaud the ongoing discussions between key stakeholders to end the transitional stage in Libya and reaffirm our support for holding fair and secure national elections, as soon as possible.

We call on all parties to put aside their differences and work towards the establishment of a stable, unified and inclusive government that can deliver basic services for all Libyans.

We urge the government and the Central Bank of Libya to ensure immediate funding for such services, including at the municipal level. An appropriate framework for effective local governance, based on successful municipal elections and a mechanism for a fair distribution of government revenues, remains a key pillar for the stabilization of Libya. The restoration of services is particularly pressing in the South, where they had been lacking for years.

We heed the call of the Libyan people for the restoration of security. As expressed during the National Conference process, Libyans favour unified security and military institutions, free from political, partisan and regional interference and subject to civilian and judicial oversight.

The EU welcomes effective and rules-based action against terrorist groups and organised crime, in compliance with human rights and Libya's obligations under international law. As shown by recent listings of individuals under international sanctions, those who threaten peace and security will be held accountable under existing UN Security Council resolutions. In this respect, we urge our Libyan partners to ensure that UN sanctions are fully implemented.

The EU continues to support Libya in institution building, improving service delivery and community stabilisation, through projects and programmes, both ongoing and committed, amounting to 431 million.

We continue to work with the Libyan authorities and organisations to promote human rights and gender equality. In particular, the EU urges our Libyan partners to respect the space of civil society organisations and journalists to carry out their work in freedom and safety.

In our meetings today, we also encouraged our Libyan partners to strengthen efforts to fight human trafficking and to ensure respect for human rights and humanitarian standards with regards to migrants and refugees, including in detention centres.

Finally, we urged all relevant stakeholders to continue moving forward with full-fledged monetary, fiscal and subsidy reforms, in collaboration with UNSMIL and World Bank/IMF, to improve the conditions for trade and to stimulate the private sector as an engine for growth and prosperity.

We also welcomed the recent decision by the National Oil Corporation (NOC) to resume oil production at the al-Sharara field, and stressed that these Libyan resources must remain under the exclusive control of the NOC and sole oversight of the GNA, for the benefit of all Libyans.""?",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Sweden', 'Romania', 'Poland', 'Italy', 'Hungary', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'Finland', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'Czech Republic', 'Belgium', 'Austria']",European Union Ambassadors joint statement after Tripoli visit,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/03/12/european-union-ambassadors-joint-statement-after-tripoli-visit/,None,
11397914,2019-03-03,"Nizar Kawan, head of the Political Department and Vice-President of Libya's (Islamist) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), expressed the satisfaction of his party with the discussions which took place between Faiez Sirraj, head of the Presidential Council and Government of National Accord, and Khalifa Haftar, Commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday 27 February.

The talks were brokered by Ghassan Salama, the head of UNSMIL.

Kawan also commended the agreement for the need to emerge from the state of crisis, the subordination of the military to civilian authority, the end of political division and the unification of institutions leading to elections.

He also praised the efforts of the United Nations Mission and its head, Ghassan Salame, and his endeavours to bring the various parties closer together in order to broaden the circle of consensus and reach a comprehensive settlement distancing the spectre of conflict.

He also noted the wisdom and flexibility of Faiez Sarraj and his keenness to avoid any blood-spilling and seek peaceful solutions to the crisis.

It will be recalled that Serraj and Hafter met in Abu Dhabi last Wednesday

Pesidency Council and Government of National Accord sources said that Serraj had insisted during the meeting on a civilian Libyan state and the necessity to shorten Libya's transitional stage and the holding of elections.

UNSMIL reported that both parties agreed during the meeting on the need to end the transitional stages in Libya through holding general elections, and on ways to maintain stability in the country and to unify its institutions.

It is noteworthy that there was no obligatory official photograph or video clip of Serraj and Hafter shaking hands or together in Abu Dhabi. This has raised concerns.

There have been many calls in Libya for Serraj and Hafter to come out and put some details to the Abu Dhabi agreement beyond the now oft used headlines.

Libyans have become weary and suspicious of these meetings and the subsequent statements released afterwards.

Hafter had hitherto resisted submitting to the military leadership of Faiez Serraj in Serraj's role as the internationally recognized Supreme Commander of the (Tripoli-based) Libyan Army.

This role is enshrined in the 2015 Skhirat Libyan Political Agreement (LPA).

Hence, beyond the headlines, the Abu Dhabi 27 February agreement has raised more questions than provided answers.

With Hafter's continuing military progress on the ground in the south of Libya, and his open ambition to ""liberate"" Tripoli, actions and events on the ground will prove more telling than any unclear statements.

Leading western states reiterate support for UNSMIL, elections and non-military solution for Libya",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Abu Dhabi', 'Libya', 'Skhirat']",Justice and Construction Party welcomes Serraj-Hafter Abu Dhabi meeting,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/03/03/justice-and-construction-party-welcomes-serraj-hafter-abu-dhabi-meeting/,None,
11397915,2019-02-22,"Mohamed El-Sallak, official Spokesperson for Faiez Serraj, head of Libya's internationally-recognized Presidency Council and Government of National Accord, stressed the keenness of Serraj to prevent the spilling of Libyan blood in the country's southern region and not to have any clash or confrontations between the brothers of the one nation, whatever the controversy.

""The security and stability of the citizens of the south is higher than any political tension,"" he said at a press conference Thursday held at the Media Center of the Prime Minister's office in Tripoli.

El-Sallak also conveyed the emphasis placed by Serraj on the need to remove civilian installations from any military operations and not endanger the lives of civilians.

The reference here is to the fighting by the Khalifa-Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA) in the south of Libya. Hafter has claimed he is imposing security and fighting criminals and Chadian mercenaries in the south.

But his military campaign in the south has also moved on to imposing security on the oilfields. This includes ""liberating"" the Sharara oilfield which was shut down from armed local protesters.

On the otherhand, continuing his ambivalent stance and mixed signals on Khalifa Hafter, the (LNA) and their role, Serraj nevertheless reaffirmed that he shared what he referred to as the ""common objectives, foremost among which is the fight against terrorism, extremism, organized crime and mercenaries from outside the borders"", calling for a common stand in the face of these dangers.

This is a clear signal that he supports Hafter's military efforts in some regards, a coded message that will not go down well with the enemies of Hafter and most of Tripoli's main militias.

The National ID Number database crisis

With regards to the National ID Number system and its database being allegedly compromised, he explained that Serraj had instructed the Civil Affairs Authority to take the necessary measures to deal with any technical matters and to ensure the integrity of the system and the database, which was of importance and impact on security.

The alleged compromise of the National ID Number database has been used by the Central Bank of Libya Governor as his reason for withholding the distribution of the hard currency allowance.

The head of the Civil Affairs Authority, onbthe other hand, has said in Libyan media that the number of fake ID numbers is not as great as has been suggested. But he as agreed that any kind of elections should be delayed until the matter is looked into.

Either way, the news has caused great alarm in Libya with fears that any future elections can be swayed by manipulation of the National ID Number.

Munich conference

With regard to the diplomatic meetings held by the President of the Council on the sidelines of last week's Munich Security conference, Serraj expressed his satisfaction with the conclusions of the meetings held with various international political and military officials, which touched upon the most important files and their ways of supporting the Government of National Accord to fulfill its aims and the need to harmonize the international stance on Libya and make a real contribution to moving the political process forward.

The reference by Serraj for the need for the ""unification of the international stance"" on Libya is a not-so-veiled call for countries such as France, Egypt, UAE, Italy, Turkey and Qatar etc to all exclusively get behind the intenationally-recognized PC/GNA.

France, Egypt, UAE and Saudi Arabia are in reality considered to be allies of Khalifa Hafter.

On the other hand, Turkey and Qatar are considered to support the Libyan ""Islamist"" political stream.

11397916,2019-02-16,"Libya's Presidency Council and Government of National Accord (PC/GNA) Interior Minister-designate, Fathi Bashagha, said in an interview with Al-Hurra television Thursday that Hafter played a ""national role"" in his recent military action in the south of Libya.

On Libya's militias he said that his government had reached ""the end of the road"" with them.

He also said that the U.S. was currently showing ""increased interest"" in supporting Libya's political consensus.

On Libya's militias

On Libya's recalcitrant militias, Bashagha said that the understanding between Libyan security institutions (militias) had ""reached a dead end"".

He stressed that ""Libyans were fed up with the militias and their excesses ... (and) these scenes (of militias) in the capital Tripoli"".

Bashagha said that his ministry had received the full support of Prime Minister Faiez Sarraj, ""but there are other security institutions (militias) that hinder the efforts of the Ministry of the Interior.

But we have reached a dead end, and that is why we have resorted to the owners of the Libyan Political Agreement (signed in Skhirat in 2015), namely the House of Representatives and the High State Council to find solutions to these security institutions. ""

Libya's instability

Bashagha, who is currently visiting the United States at the invitation of the US government, stressed that Libya's political instability leads to security instability, ""which is costly to neighbouring and Mediterranean countries.""

On Hafter's push south

On the move by Hafter's Libyan National Army (LNA) south and the dispute over control of the Sharara oilfield, Bashagha said that ""the PC/GNA is concerned by any forces outside its control that expands or moves from place to place in Libya without consultation.""

Bashagha was referring to Hafter's LNA launching an offensive in the south last month to fight hardline Islamists, Chadian opposition forces and smugglers across the border as well as to secure the Sharara oilfield that has been shutdown by the Natonal Oil Corporation (NOC) since December.

The shutdown and declaration of force majeure by the NOC was as a result of Sharara being occupied by locals protesting what they say are genuine grievances. The NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla insists they are armed groups holding the NOC and nation to armed ransome.

Bagsagha said that what happened in the south (Hafter's military action) was ""acceptable from the national point of view"" and that after Hafter's action the south was now free of organized crime - crime which had been exacerbated by political divisions of Libya.

Bashagha gave the most supportive comment on Hafter to come out of a PC/GNA minister in recent years. But he qualified it politically.

""We hope that Hafar's forces will only play their national role, not invest them politically in order to increase the division or achieve a gain because if this trend goes, I think there will be other repercussions,"" he said.

Bashagha welcomed and then gave his own reading of the recent U.S. statement on Hafter and the military activity in the south.

The US statement expressed concern about the ongoing tensions in the southern Libyan region, called on all parties to establish mutually acceptable security arrangements and ensure the integrity of the National Oil Corporation and allow it to resume its work.

Bashagha said that ""this statement may make the other party (Hafter) resort to reason.""

He added: ""If Libya continues in this division, the division is not in favour of either the East or the West nor the South.

And, as I am the primary person responsible for security, security is indivisible. If there is security in Tripoli and if there is no security in the south or the eastern region certainly Tripoli will remain threatened "".

Looking forward he added ""We hope politicians, dissidents or those who want to impose their opinion with the use of arms, or by the force of law, or by legislation, or by any other means - we hope they make concessions for Libya because the situation is not in their favour and not in the interest of anyone.""

Negative foreign interventions

On foreign intervention in Libyan affairs, Bashagha described these attempts as ""negative"", noting that these interventions deepen Libya's problems rather than solve them.

In response to a direct question about the Italian-French conflict in Libya, he said that ""not only France and Italy, many countries intervene. We consider this intervention as a negative intervention and not positive because positive interventions should promote reconciliation between Libyans and bring the views closer.""

Bashagha refused to name any countries but went on to say that ""There are five or six Arab or regional countries fighting in Libya, and there are two European countries that are clearly fighting, and certainly there are other countries. If the Libyan situation continues in this way, we will find other European and foreign countries fighting over Libya. ""

However, Bashagha saw an alternative solution to this conundrum.

""I think the security, economic and investment partnership with the US would protect Libya from the evil of these (foreign) interventions and this is what we are working on now.""

He concluded that ""the United States is clear. Its interest is in the security file in terms of combating terrorism and the stability of Libya and supporting the Government of National Accord and the search for reconciliation and the unification of Libya and the protection of the Libyan Investment Authority and the Central Bank of Libya and the National Oil Corporation"".",Libya Herald,energy,,"['United States', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Skhirat', 'Chad', 'Italy', 'France']",Bashagha recognizes Hafter's role,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/02/16/bashagha-recognizes-hafters-role/,None,
11397917,2019-02-15,"Mohamed El-Sallak, the spokesperson for Faiez Serraj, the head of Libya's Presidency Council and Government of National Accord, said during a press conference on Thursday at the Media Center of the Prime Minister's office in Tripoli, that Serraj had no quarrel with any Libyan party in Libya's south.

Southern Libya

Serraj was keen to come across as being neutral between the various southern tribes and minorities in southern Libya such as the Tebu and Tuarag who's role was pivotal in the military battle to impose security, control the south, fight foreign mercenaries and ""liberate"" the Sharara oilfield.

Serraj said that it was the shared goal of all Libyans to fight against terrorism, organized crime and mercenaries from outside the country's borders, and illegal immigration gangs.

This was an attempt by Serraj to come across as being strong against fighting crime and foreign mercenaries and mitigating accusations by the south that Tripoli did not care about the south.

Dialogue not war

Serraj also renewal his invitation for organized work and the unification of efforts, in particular under the umbrella of legality, and the emphasis on his readiness for cooperation in this regard.

He stressed the approach taken by his Government of National Accord from the beginning of its reign, which is to resolve all political differences between Libyans through dialogue and not the battlefields.

This was a not-so-coded message to Khalifa Hafter and his Libyan National Army (LNA) who's is perceived to be seeking a military solution to Libya's political problems.

Oilfields in the south

With regards specifically to the oilfields in the south, Serraj stressed the need to remove Libya's oilfields and the source of Libyan wealth, from any political friction or controversy,

He stressed the need to keep the oilfields under the direction of the internationally recognized National Oil Corporation (NOC), with its current headquarters in Tripoli, and under the protection of Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG).

With regards to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tripoli NOC, Hafter has already handed over oilfields to Sanalla's Tripoli and the House of Representatives (HoR) has already called on him to lift the force majeure status at Sharara.

However, Hafter will disagree with Serraj on handing Sharara back to the incompetent and untrustworthy PFG. It was under the local PFG that Sharara was occupied by protesters/armed groups which led to its shut down.

Serraj and his administration are too isolated in Tripoli. Their legitimacy, traction and effectiveness does not extend as far as southern Libya. The PFG is in theory aligned to the Serraj administration, yet Serraj had been unable to control it.

Local security forces are often too partisan and too sympathetic to locals and local issues - at the expense of the bigger national picture of keeping the oil flowing.

The events since the 2011 February Revolution, including Jadrans double attempts to hold Libya to ransom over the oilfields show that a national entity needs to be in charge of Libya's oilfields.

Constitution and elections

With regards to the election process, Serraj expressed his full support for the way forward in creating the atmosphere for a parliamentary and presidential electoral process on a constitutional basis.

He vowed to provide all necessary support for their achievement and stressed that elections are the only way for the Libyan people to choose their representatives, and renewed his support for the convening of the National Conference (Multaqa) under the auspices of the United Nations.

Economic reforms and 2019 Budget

On Libya's economic reforms introduced last September, Serraj confirmed the continued cooperation with the Tripoli Central Bank of Libya and the competent authorities, to complete the reforms, which he said have reflected positively on Libyan citizens, as well as the imminent completion of the 2019 Financial Arrangements (Budget).",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya']",Serraj calls for dialogue not war in south,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/02/15/serraj-calls-for-dialogue-not-war-in-south/,None,

In a choreographed piece of slick public relations (or propaganda), the LNA's General Command arrived in Sebha to what it billed as a follow up of its military operations in the southern region.

The LNA's Military Media Division said they had arrived at the Karama (Dignity) Operations Room in Tamenhint airbase following the orders of LNA's General Commander, Khalifa Haftar.

The senior LNA commanders that arrived included Air Force Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Saqr Al-Jaroushi, Director of the Special Forces Directorate Major General Wanis Boukhamada, Secretary-General of LNA's General Command Maj. Gen. Abdelkareem Hadia and Director of the General Commander's Office Major General Khairi Al-Tamimi.

Speaking at a press conference today, the LNA's Official Spokesperson Ahmed Mesmari said that the high-level military delegation had arrived in the south to convey a message from the LNA General Commander Khalifa Haftar to the residents of the south.

Mesmari confirmed news circulating in the media that Haftar was supposed to visit Sebha but had to postpone his visit due to scheduled meetings with a number of foreign delegations.

These included delegations from the city of Misrata who had arrived at Benghazi to emphasize the unity of Libyans, Mesmari said.

He emphasised that the military operations in the south came to secure the region, not for its occupation or in aggression.

He saluted the Tebu, Tuareg, Awlad Suleiman and all the tribes of the South, and called on them not to listen to misleading media.

He reiterated that the LNA had now successfully eliminated terrorism in the city of Derna.

The optics projected by the LNA's General Command's arrival will send all the positive vibes that the LNA wishes to send out. That is what they were designed to do.

They project the image of a regular army as opposed to a collection of militias forced together by Hafter, that the LNA's critics insist the LNA is.

The optics will be worrying for the Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National and it's new-born Presidential Guard.

The images play to and augment Hafter's narrative that his LNA is effective and has delivered security to the south - something the other anti-LNA forces failed to do.

The implication and the message to residents in the rest of Libya is that only the LNA can deliver security for all of Libya.

The LNA's projection that it ""liberated"" the Sharara oilfield for the NOC adds to this image. This is why Ageela Saleh yesterday called upon Sanalla to lift the force majeure on the Sharara oilfield immediately. The east is keen that the LNA gets full credit for returning Sharara to production.

No doubt the LNA hopes these optics will help it project its reach to western Libya and Tripoli itself. Hafter and the LNA have made no secret of their desire and ultimate goal of ""liberating"" Tripoli and hope these power images will resonate in Tripoli.

However, while the LNA may be basking in its recent projected triumphs in the south, there is no guarantee that it will last. Many of the western-based militias will do all they can to prevent Hafter entering Tripoli - peacefully or otherwise.

Even in the south, the LNA's victory is still uncertain.

Specifically, the United Nations-backed and Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National Accord (PC/GNA) based in the capital Tripoli, and the House of Representatives's Interim Government based in the eastern city of Beida, will cooperate on the billion-dollar 'Port of Susah' project.

""A historical moment, the development of the Port of Susah has secured the support of both the East and West - the culmination of months of discussions between the once fractured Libyan governments that are now focused on one common objective,"" said Michael Guidry, founder and CEO of U.S.-based The Guidry Group.

""The pivotal goal of the Port of Susah is not only to spark an economic resurgence and additional investments from the international community, but to chart a new course for Libya and its people."", he added.

It revealed that the unified support is the result of three years of hard work, as well as months of discussions between the Seaport Authority officials in the East and West.

The Group said that the now united representatives of the Libyan people have made it their highest priority to deliver economic opportunity for their people by redeveloping, restoring and modernizing Libya's critical infrastructure, starting with ports and maritime capabilities through the development of the Port of Susah.

""The Seaport Authorities in the East and West are working closely together on everything related to the ports and maritime capabilities and The Guidry Group is a valued partner that believes in the potential of Libya,"" said Captain Hassan Jwaili, Seaport Chairman of the East.

""In addition to the multi-purpose port and logistics center, projected to generate tens of millions of dollars in its first year alone, we have asked The Guidry Group team to join new investors in other opportunities available across our nation."", Jwaili added.

The Seaport Authority, the governing authority that manages all the ports in the East and the West, will coordinate development to ensure and guarantee the effective planning and delivery of the Port of Susah.

""The Port of Susah will help to grow our economy and create much needed employment opportunities for our nation's people who are hungry for change,"" said Dr. Nasereldeen Mehna, a member of the House of Representatives. ""In the near future we will see one united government but, in the meantime, we have to open our country for investment in essential infrastructure projects and guarantee the transfer of knowledge and know-how in Libya."", Mehna said.

Port of Susah: Economy, Revenues and Employment

When completed, the Guidry Group said, the Port of Susah, a major international trans-shipment hub container port, will be a crossroads in North Africa for mainline cargo vessels traveling to and from Asia and Europe via the Suez Canal, as well as to and from the United States.

Economy

It said that the Port of Susah will breathe vital economic life into the region, help improve the human condition, and position Libya as a major economic center for trade and commerce once it becomes fully operational upon completion in 2022.

The development includes essential world-class regional cargo-handling facilities, improved road networks, employment for Libyan workers as well as expansion of business opportunities elsewhere within the country, and significant benefit in macroeconomic terms.

It revealed that this is the first-ever design-build-operate-transfer, or D.B.O.T., public- and private-partnership (PPP) infrastructure project in Libya, aimed at paving the way for Libya's economic growth and leading role in regional trade. At the end of the long-term concession, the entire project is transferred to Libya's government as part of the country's resurgence.

Revenues

In 2022 it projects that the Port of Susah is expected to generate approximately $60 million in revenues, which are anticipated to double by the year 2040. This excludes additional revenues from handling general and bulk cargo, as well as those generated from the integrated logistics and freight facilities.

Revenue estimates are based on the port being able to handle around 500,000 TEUs {Twenty Equivalent Units] in the first year of operations - Phase 1 of the project - and increasing an anticipated three-times in Phase 2 and 3.

Employment

The Guidry Group says that the Port of Susah project will create significant job opportunities for hundreds of Libyan nationals in a highly efficient, productive and technologically advanced cargo-handling facilities. There will be a significant investment in training facilities that includes simulators and virtual classrooms to ensure that a major source of personnel for the project is local.

It will be recalled that the Guidry Group was selected from among a competitive field of nine international firms in 2015 to develop the multi-purpose port following a multi-year world-wide solicitation of proposals by Libya.

Founded in 1985, the international investment firm has become increasingly focused on the development of critical infrastructure, including large-scale projects to help revive war-torn countries by assisting them with rebuilding their economies and communities.

The firm is also a global leader in a range of personal and data security services, business pathfinding, specialty insurance, and crisis response and management, with experience in 148 countries. To learn more, please visit www.guidry.com.

11397922,2019-01-19,"Ahmed Al-Mismari, official spokesperson for the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA), announced the death of AQIM-affiliate, Abduelminam Al-Hassnawi (aka Abu Tallha Al-Libi), Al-Mahdi Rajab Dungo (alleged IS Minister of Defence) and an Egyptian called Abdullah Al-Dusouki in an LNA raid Friday morning northwest of Sebha.

The deaths have not been independently corroborated. Some media reports have already refuted that Al-Hassnawi was one of the ""terrorists"" killed in the LNA raid.

There were also brief clashes reported Friday in Sebha, between local LNA units and rival militias, but no deaths or casualties were reported.

The LNA raid was part of a major push announced by the LNA to the southwest of Libya to ""cleanse foreign armed groups, combat crime and enforce peace and stability,

We have started a full scale military operation in the South-West of Libya, LNA spokesperson Al-Mismari announced last Tuesday.

The LNA pledged to ""secure the southwest from terrorist elements of Al-Qaeda, ISIS and rogue bandits involved in kidnapping, extortion and smuggling and threaten to change the topography of southern Libya"".

They also promised to ""Secure key-strategic oil and gas installations, Man-made river (MMR) stations and ensure deliverance of services, fuel and gas to citizens"".

The LNA mobilized several units to the southwest, including the Tariq Ben Zeyad battalion arrived at Taminhent airbase (30 Kilometres) north of Fezzan's capital Sebha last Sunday spending a night in Jufra on Saturday.

Other local LNA units were re-mobilized to Taminhent Airbase which the 166th infantry brigade and the 177th brigade reportedly abandoned in December.

Several key military barracks and checkpoints, including Sebha's civil airport remain under control of local community-based militias and negotiations are now ongoing to be handed over to newly-arrived LNA units.

Retracing the conflict over 2018, Sebha had witnessed four months of deadly communal clashes from January to May between the Tebus and Awlad Sulieman tribe, which had resulted in loss of life, including many civilians, and the large destruction of state and private property.

On first January this year, a fierce fight erupted in the Agriculture Circuits near Ghadduwah village (65 Kilometres) southeast Sebha between the LNA's 10th Infantry Brigade and the predominantly a Salafist Khalid Bin Walid brigade against a Chadian armed militia which resulted in three deaths and several casualties.

Another Chadian armed group was aallegedly responsible for the attack on Traghen's 10th Infantry Brigade (140 Kilometres south of Sebha and 45 Kilometres east of Murzuq) on 27 December. It resulted in at least one dead and the confiscation of up to 34 armed vehicles from the 10th Infantry's barracks.

It is also worth recalling that the LNA managed to free 22 civilian hostages held in containers by the Chadian militia in the Agriculture Circuits.

Initially, it was though they were kidnapped by ISIS in separate incidents at Tazerbu on 24 November and al-Fugha on 29 October last year.

ISIS-affiliated social media accounts had claimed responsibility for the kidnappings at the time.

The LNA also repelled an attack on Taminhent Airbase on 1 June 2018 which it attributed to a joint Benghazi Defense Brigades (BDB/Saraya) Chadian attack.

Last Sunday, SRSG and head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) Ghassan Salame, visited Sebha for the first time since he was appointed on 22 June 2017.

He met with representatives from Fezzan's municipalities, communities, dignitaries and academics where he revealed UNSMIL had created committee on first the of January ""Special Committee for the South"".

Although, the LNA had previously announced similar military operations in the south, this one seems to be on a more serious scale. The fact that now the LNA can divert forces from Derna may be a factor.

It will also be recalled that the LNA had launched its military operation ""Law Enforcement"" in March 2018, during which several airstrikes were conducted against foreign armed groups in the south, but it did not involve such a large ground operation as this month's.

Last Saturday, there were conflicting reports on social media on clashes between the Chadian Conseil de Commandement Militaire Pour le Salut de la Republique (CCMSR) armed opposition group and the Darfuri Sudanese Liberation Army/Minni Minawi (SLA/MM) armed opposition militia.

They were reported about 245 kilometres southeast of the border town of Gatroun, near the Kouri gold mining site.

This clash was seen as part of a potentially wider conflict on Libyan soil of foreign armed groups affiliated with Libyan factions.

The LNA-aligned SLA/MM had been previously stationed in the Jufra region since early 2016.

CCMSR-affiliated social media accounts denounced the SLA/MM incursion and accused the LNA of being complicit with the Chadian regime in undermining their struggle in liberating the Chadian people.

On the diplonatic front, Italy's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, paid a visit to the capitals of Libya's southern neighbours, Niamey and N'Djamena on Tuesday and Wednesday.

11397923,2019-01-10,"Libya's Ministry of Interior (MoI) aligned to the Tripoli-based and Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National Accord has warned against the corrosive effect of rumours (fake news) on society.

It warned against the danger of spreading rumours on society adding that ""Rumours are a serious phenomenon that is used to strike at the cohesion of societies"".

It said that ""the sources of rumour differ from individuals to the print, audio and visual media. With the spread of social media and its dominance in society, the owners of suspicious agendas who manage these sites have been able to spread their poison and rumours that have negatively impacted the simple citizen and fuelled public opinion, thereby benefiting their interests and agendas.""

""To counter rumours and their devastating effects on society"", the MoI's Sunday statement continued, ""we must intensify our efforts by taking simple steps, including not contributing to the redissemination of these lies, and taking news only from reliable and well-known sources"".

Th MoI did not define or identify what it considered ""well-known sources"". It also did not deal with the fact that people holding opposing political views may have different perspectives on what is good or bad or what is right or wrong.

A good example is the Libya Dawn versus Karama or tge so-called Islamists versus liberal movements.

""The Ministry of Interior has more than once confirmed the seriousness of spreading rumours within the community and that this does not serve the conditions that our country is experiencing"".

The MoI added that it ""has alerted through more than one local and foreign media patform as well as social networking pages, which have been observed through monitoring the publication of many wrong news before confirming its authenticity.""

However, while the MoI rightly pointed out the shortfalls of poor quality regular and social media operating in the post-Qaddafi era Libya, it failed to give a balanced reflection of the reality in Libya.

It and the Serraj government have also failed to provide solutions to mitigate the causes and effects of negative social media - beyond complaining about and hiding behind them.

There is no doubt that social media as a tool, has played a major part in exploiting the political, legitimacy and security vacuum in Libya.

The MoI failed to reflect honestly the contributing role of the Serraj government and all the official state entities under its authority. This also includes the House of Representatives (HoR) and the internationally unrecognized government in the east.

On the highest level, the failure by Libya's political elite to agree on or present to the general Libyan public a new unified post-Qaddafi social contract and a unified, legitimate political structure, has been the major cause of the vacuum exploited by those pursuing a negative Libyan media agenda.

On another level, in western Libya, the media performance and output by the media departments of the Serraj ministries has been poor.

Indeed, the poor performance starts with the head of the Presidency Council and Government of National Accord head Faiez Serraj who limits his live press appearances, preferring to use prerecorded messages and using his personal spokesperson Mohamed El-Sallak instead.

Serraj, avoiding frequent live press conferences and live media appearances sends the wrong signal to media and the general Libyan public at large.

It smacks of fear and a lack of confidence, giving the impression that he has something to hide. This feeds into the conspiracy theory social media rumour mill.

Moreover, the various government media departments are unable or not prepared to respond instantly to media enquiries.

They are still in the traditional mode of standard press and video clip releases. They are often very much responsive rather than proactive to the news cycle and rather than positioning themselves ahead of the modern 24-hour news and fake news/rumour curve, they are often fire-fighting and playing catch up.

While paying lip service to transparancy, accountability, liberty and democracy, the experience of this writer and this publication is that the Serraj administration is sadly still in a semi-Qaddafi era media mode.

Many an occasion had the Libya Herald contacted the Serraj administration for confirmation, clarification and further analysis without success.

Hence the Serraj government must practice what it preaches by becoming more open and responsive to the media and adopt a freedom of information stance with regards to information.

It must upgrade the capabilities of all government media departments in line with the modern 24-hour regular and social media cycle.

Only by filling the news and information vacuum will the Libyan authorities have some success in reducing fake news and improving social cohesion. A social cohesion that is needed for a unified social contract and constitution.

A constitution that is also needed to enable Libya to exit its current weak transitional stage.",Libya Herald,energy,,['Libya'],Rumours are a danger to social cohesion: Serraj government,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/01/10/rumours-are-a-danger-to-social-cohesion-serraj-government/,None,
11397955,2019-07-19,"The head and members of the Libya's High Advisory Committee for Treatment (Abroad) submitted their collective resignation yesterday in protest at the interference of the Tripoli Central Bank of Libya (CBL), the Tripoli Health Ministry reported yesterday.

The move is rare in Libya where holders of state positions rarely hand in their resignation. The move is seen as a symbolic protest and it is unlikely that their resignations will be accepted.

One very highly placed health official in Tripoli told Libya Herald yesterday that the members of the committee are highly qualified and respected. He said they had worked hard over the last year to put in place a new neutral and effective mechanism that would reduce corruption and nepotism in the historically much abused state-financed treatment abroad process.

The mechanism is seen as a good effort and the CBL had not made any official protests or comments about its introduction. It also did not give the new system a trail period to prove or disprove its effectiveness.

The Committee's request for their collective resignation comes, they say, in protest against the suffering of patients sent for treatment abroad in Germany, Tunisia and Egypt after the failure of the Tripoli CBL to implement and transfer financial health allocations to them.

The Committee considered the failure by the Tripoli CBL to transfer health allocations a ""clear interference in the ministry's terms of reference and a reflection of the administrative corruption resulting from abuse of jurisdiction."" In other words, political interferences and abuse of divisions of power.

The incident is a prime example of the omnipotence of the Tripoli CBL post 2011 headed by Saddek El-Kaber and Tarik Yousef Magarief.

Critics say these two have hijacked the Tripoli CBL to run it as a duopoly, taking advantage of the power and legitimacy vacuum in Libya post 2011.

It will be recalled that the Tripoli CBL is accountable to the country's parliament, the House of Representatives, based far away in Tobruk.

The Tripoli CBL have taken advantage of the political division between eastern and western Libya to act as an independent agency.

El-Kaber and Magarief have refused to hold a full board meeting with eastern-based board members and El-Kaber has refused to step down despite being dismissed by parliament.

They have also taken advantage of Tripoli's very weak internationally-recognized Presidency Council and Government of National Accord led by Faiez Serraj.

In reality, the CBL is supposed to acquiesce to Tripoli's executive when it comes to political decisions on how money is spent.

However, in the face of no oversight or deterent in the weak post revolutionary Libya, El-Kaber and Magarief have chosen make themselves as the self-appointed custodians of Libya's wealth and finances.

However, on many occassion they have insisted that they are a technocratic, monetary/financial institution at arms length from Libya's political tug-of-war.

The reality, however, is that they have had a huge monolithic hand in deciding Libya's spending policy - political policy -since 2011.

The resignation of the treatment abroad committee came in response to the suffering of patients despite the completion of health abroad approvals and technical conditions.

As a result of the mass resignation, the Tripoli Ministry of Health yesterday also announced the complete suspension of treatment abroad and advised citizens who receive treatment approvals abroad not to travel because their treatment allowances may not be met.

The members of the Committee have apologized to all Libyan patients, blaming those who are responsible (the Tripoli CBL) for the lack of implementation of Health Ministry and Tripoli government policy.

They also hold the CBL legally liability for any complications or problems that occur to patients due to the failure to implement the required treatments on time.

The Committee said that they were forced to resign because of the failure to implement the treatment procedures for patients sent abroad despite the completion of approvals and conditions, and despite the approval of both the Audit Bureau and the Ministry of Finance.

Moreover, they said that the CBL stopped the process despite the organization of the treatment process ""in a scientific way based on technical statistics and an electronic archiving system and for the first time in 5 years the electronic archiving system is implemented in the countries of treatment abroad.""

They praised the new system and procedures for the ""level of professionalism in providing treatment opportunities"" and ""the number of reforms that have taken place in this file""

This comes after the limiting of state-financed treatment to the countries of Germany, Tunisia, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, Austria and China.

The Committee expressed their regret as a result of ""the failure of the treatment system and the failure of the implementation of its outcomes, leading to the return of patients to the point of zero and their resort to (the previous) chaos and nepotism as a result of lack of access to treatment through the official methods of systematic and state guarantees.""

The Committee also pointed out that their resignation was the result of a legal consultation that stipulates that they hold part of the responsibility after the deterioration of the health condition of many patients in Tunisia who are threatening legal action.

Some analysts put the CBL failure to finance treatment abroad to a fall in Libya's oil revenues while money has had to be transferred to fight the war launched by Khalifa Hafter on Tripoli since 4 April.

11398060,2019-02-09,"The Tripoli Protection Force (TPF), a coaliton of Tripoli's main militias, has called on Libya's Attorney General to immediately and urgently investigate the shipment of armoured vehicles that was seized by customs officers at the port of Khoms.

There were unconfirmed reports that guns were fired at the port as there was an attempt to forcibly remove the armoured vehicles form the port.

It will be recalled that the Serraj Ministry of Interior announced on Thursday that the seized shipment of armoured vehicles arriving on the Maltese flagged ship Marco was confiscated by its forces upon the instruction of the Attorney General's Office - until the Attorney General's Office concludes its investigation into the case.

The shipment had allegedly arrived from Turkey, but reportedly had no official documentation. This may have been convenient as there is still a UN ban on the export of weapons to Libya.

The TPF also called for an investigation into the shipments of various weapons and ammunition that had previously arrived at Khoms port last December. That shipment had also allegedly arrived from Turkey.

The TPF called on the AG to reveal all the facts to the Libyan people, revealing those involved in these shipments and the official Letters of Credit used to import them.

The TPF also called on the Attorney General to investigate the recent south Tripoli militia fighting, and to prosecute those responsible for it using ministerial decisions to deliberately spread sedition.

On another note, the TPF also called for an investigation into the south Tripoli militia fighting financiers and supporters, and the saboteurs of the successful peace efforts.

The TPF reasserted that it now only recognizes the legitimacy of the Serraj-led Presidential Council when it acts in unison with its nine full members, as prescribed by the 2015 Skhirat Libyan Political Agreement (LPA).

This is a very convenient fig leaf for the TPF as it knows fully well that nine members of the Presidency Council are never present and never agree on Libya's polarized politics.

The TPF also demanded that UNSMIL fully implement the LPA, and not use it selectively using the LPA's authority for suspicious party and regional agendas.

Again, the TPF is playing politics here as it knows that UNSMIL and the Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National Accord are unable to fully implement the LPA.

One of the main reasons why the LPA cannot be implemented is the continued existence of militias - including the TPF.

The continued existence of militias at the expense of a regular, accountable and legitimate police and army directly negates the recreation of a strong state.

The TPF also said, with much irony and political surrealism, that it was looking forward to the ""urgent"" forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections, to renew true legitimacy derived from the Libyan ballot box.

It undertook to protect the elections and to cooperate fully with the High National Electoral Commission (HNEC) to make the elections a success.

The TPF makes these declarations knowing full well that any new fully democratic, legitimate, independent and strong government would do away with self-fulfilling militias in favour of a regular accountable army and police force.

11398265,2019-10-02,"The Military Operations Room aligned with the internationally-recognized government of Libya, led by Faiez Serraj, reported that Tripoli's Mitiga airport was on fire yesterday after it was the subject of another airstrike.

The airport has been closed to civilian flights since the first of September after an airstrike nearly hit a landing passenger plane returning with pilgrims from Saudi Arabia.

The Volcano of Anger Operations Room reported that ''Foreign military aircraft, in support of rebel war criminal Haftar, is has just targeted Mitiga international airport''.

In response, the Military Information Division of Khalifa Hafter's Libyan National Army (LNA) claimed that following reports from its intelligence services that monitor different positions at Mitiga and Misrata airports, and after the identification of these sites as being used in the processing, arming and storage of Turkish drones and their ammunition, as well as two bunkers at Misrata airport that were used for the same purpose, and as these positions threaten the LNA's Armed Forces - its Air Force attacked them.

It claimed that its fighter jets had taken off simultaneously from several bases in order to eliminate their targets and threat.

It also went on to claim that this air campaign had achieved all its goals with precision, totally destroying the facilities used in the storage and processing of aircraft. It also claimed that its fighter jets had returned to their bases after carrying their duties and successfully achieving their goals.

Today, the pro Tripoli Operations Room claimed the ''continuation of the criminal record of the rebel war criminal Haftar in targeting residential neighbourhoods and infrastructure with random shells'' with ''the fall of a shell on the police station opposite the electricity company at the Al-Jibs checkpoint and the injury of a civilian, who was transferred to hospital to receive treatment.

While yesterday it claimed the ''continuing their criminal record of targeting ambulance teams and medical crews: the rebel war criminal Haftar's militias directly targeted an ambulance in the Sw?ni area that caused damage to the vehicle and injured the ambulance driver.

On Monday it claimed that ''UAE drones in support of the war criminal Haftar just targeting in three air raids the administrative headquarters of the Man-made River Water Investment System in the central region of Sirte and resulting in material losses to the building.

On Saturday, it claimed that ''UAE drones in support of the war criminal Haftar targeted in three air raids the Bunyan Marsous and security force that eliminated the largest ISIS stronghold outside Iraq and Syria''.

Also on Saturday it claimed that ''UAE drones in support of war criminal Haftar targeted the Sirte Cattle project complex causing material losses and a civilian from shrapnel''. It added that this bombing come four days after the announcement by the complex that it had finished its maintenance and returned to operation.

What is clear from these reports by both sides is that military action is actually intensifying leading to the New York General Assembly meetings and in the run up to the international conference organized by Germany.

It could also be surmised that neither side feel that the international community s going to take any serious action in response to the continuing military operations on the ground or in the air. Both sides feel they have impunity to act to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any peace negotiations.

It said that the two discussed ""the current situation in Libya and prospects for achieving a political solution to the Libya conflict"".

The meeting comes ahead of a planned international conference on Libya initiated by Germany seeking a ceasefire to the current fighting and a political solution to the Libyan crisis.

It will be recalled that Hafter and his LNA launched an attack on Tripoli on 4 April with the pretext of ""liberating"" it from the ""terrorists, Islamists and militias"" controlling Tripoli.

Hafter's military campaign has so far failed to take Tripoli, with his forces suffering a setback in Gharian where they were forced out by the forces defending the capital and nominally aligned to the internationally recognized government led by Faiez Serraj.

Indeed, after the initial advances by his forces to the edges of the capital gained through first mover's advantage, Hafter's forces have at best been stuck in a stalemate and in many cases reportedly being pushed back further way from the capital.

The stalemate on the ground has seen increased fighting in the air, mostly with the use of drones.

Both sides accuse the other of using foreign-supplied weapons and personnel in the fighting - despite a UN Security Council arms embargo.

Tripoli accuses Hafter of using personnel and arms from France, Egypt and the UAE, while the Hafter side accuses Tripoli of using Turkish-supplied weapons and personnel.

11398268,2019-09-05,"In his latest update on the Libyan situation to the UN Security Council yesterday, the head of UNSMIL, Gassan Salame said that there has now been over 100 civilian deaths, 300 injured and 120,000 displaced as well as fighter deaths ''in the low thousands'' as a result of the war launched by Khalifa Hafter to ''liberate'' Tripoli on 4 April this year.

Salame condemned the eastern-based Interim Government for setting up parallel unelected councils, called for the freeing of and the investigation into the disappearance of House of Representatives (HoR) member Siham Sergiwa.

The UNSMIL head said that the UNSC arms embargo on Libya has been ''ineffective'' and that fighters on both sides were ready for peace as they were exhibiting ''combat fatigue''. He added that ""The idea that war should be given a chance and that a military solution is at all possible is quite simply a chimera"".

Ultimately, Salame said that without the cooperation of key external actors (popularly believed to be France, Egypt, UAE, Turkey and Qatar), the Libyan conflict will continue.

Allow me to congratulate the Russian Federation for its Presidency of the Security Council this month.

Mr. President,

Members of the Security Council,

I am grateful for the Council's expression of support on the occasion of the emergency session held on August 10, the day of the Benghazi bombing which killed three United Nations staff members.

I would like to pay tribute to our colleagues and friends Clive Peck, Hussein El-Hadar, and Seniloli Tabuatausole whose lives were cut short by that cowardly attack. Clive and ""Tabs"", as he was known, travelled the world as UN security personnel, enabling the vital work of peace making and delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance. Hussein had been with the Mission for nearly six years and was due to be married this month. As United Nations staff members, their sacrifice for the benefit of Libya and of all Libyans will not be forgotten.

I also want to pay tribute to our two staff members who are still recovering from serious injuries and the eight other injured Libyan civilians. In parallel to the United Nations internal inquiry into the incident, we are requesting Libyan authorities to cooperate with us in the investigation and to swiftly bring to justice the perpetrators. I would like to call upon Member States to provide the UN with any information they may have on this horrific attack.

The United Nations will remain in Libya. Naturally, we will work to mitigate further the risk to our personnel and operations, but the tragic irony is that the worse the situation on the ground becomes, the greater the need for our presence, mediation efforts, and provision of humanitarian assistance. The Benghazi hub remains open and a limited number of UN staff members continues to operate from there. A longer-term position concerning the hub will only be taken once a fuller assessment of the security situation in the city and associated risks has been taken.

Mr. President,

Today marks five months to the day since General Haftar launched his offensive to seize control of Tripoli, halting an active and promising political process and returning the country to renewed conflict. Since the 4th of April, the conflict has spread geographically and has exacted a heavy toll on civilians and those fighting. To date, more than 100 civilians have been killed and over 300 injured, and 120,000 civilians have been displaced. There are no confirmed figures for the total number of fighters who have died so far, but anecdotally the figure appears to be in the low thousands. Yet another generation of young Libyan men are spilling their blood on the battlefield when their skills could better be used to rebuild their country.

I would like to draw your attention to the shelling of airports. A disaster was closely averted last Sunday when a plane full of returning pilgrims from Mecca was miraculously not hit by a series of shells fired at Mitiga airport. Seven people were injured. I would ask for the Council's strong support in condemning such indiscriminate shelling which threatens the lives of substantial numbers of civilians.

The UN have consistently responded to GNA requests that we inspect sites that have been subject to attacks. We have conducted multiple visits to Mitiga airport, one to Zuwara airport, and to other civilian sites including the Tajoura Detention Centre that have been subjected to either air strikes, drone attacks or have been hit by various projectiles since the 4th of April. The reports from all of these visits are shared with the Panel of Experts and when needed with the ICC as well.

Mr. President,

The situation in the southern town of Murzuq continues to be grave. Over one hundred people have been killed and many more injured in fighting between the Tebu and Ahali communities; this includes the precision airstrikes on 4 August targeting a gathering of Tebu representatives in which over 40 were killed. Thousands have been displaced as homes and businesses have been looted and burned. This local conflict risks taking on a national dimension as each party mobilises national actors behind them.

Elders from outside Murzuq have tried to mediate an end to the violence but unfortunately without success. On 24 and 25 August, following a number of preparatory meetings, I convened separate sessions with Ahali and with Tebu representatives to discuss: ending the violence, the return of the displaced and to initiate a discussion on how the roots of grievances can be addressed to prevent future tensions again turning into serious conflict. The UN Humanitarian Agencies have delivered assistance to 1,500 families affected by the violence in Murzuq.

Reestablishing local civil peace is an integral part of our mission. It is particularly true in the south where the events in Murzuq may spill-over to other cities where different tribes and ethnic groups have until recently lived in peace.

Local peace also needs to be built on stable local authorities. I remain concerned by attempts of the unrecognised eastern government to assert control over local municipalities. The efforts by the interim government to conduct parallel municipal elections or establish appointed municipal steering committees, including in municipalities where elected councils are already in place, are exacerbating local conflict and fragmenting local governance structures. This is unfortunate given that local governments are the most resilient institutions and are expected to play a crucial role in reconciliation, delivery of services and reconstruction and Libyans broadly agree on the need for further decentralization.

Mr. President,

Kidnappings and enforced disappearances continue across the country. I am very disappointed to report that there has been no news regarding the fate of the House of Representatives member Siham Sergewa since she was abducted from her home in Benghazi on the 17th of July. I reiterate the call on the authorities in the east to investigate the enforced disappearance of Madam Sergewa and make the findings known. These authorities are responsible for the safety and security of the people under their territorial control and they must take all necessary steps to clarify her whereabouts. The voices of Libya's elected representatives cannot be allowed to be quashed through intimidation or enforced disappearance. I welcome the continued and loud support of the many member states demanding Ms. Sergewa's swift return and I again reiterate the absolute need for those found responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law to be held accountable before the competent bodies.

Mr. President,

Following my call for the gradual and progressive closure of all detention centres holding migrants and refugees, on the 1st of August the Minister of Interior ordered the closure of three of these centres. The United Nations submitted a contingency plan to the Government of National Accord on alternative options to detention. This plan includes release into urban settings with provision of assistance, provision of necessary health care, access to the labour market, and identification of durable solutions outside Libya. These centres need to be closed through a gradual and deliberate process in which the relevant UN agencies are provided the necessary means to assist this vulnerable population.

Despite these calls and Government claims to have shuttered the Tajoura Detention centre - which was the site of the deadly airstrike in July - migrants continue to be sent there. Migrants and refugees continue to be detained on compounds controlled by armed groups placing them in extreme danger. Nearly 500 of those who escaped the July attack on the Tajoura detention centre spontaneously entered the Gathering and Departure Facility which is managed by the Department of Combatting Illegal Migration. With over 1,000 refugees, the infrastructure in the Gathering and Departure Facility is overstretched and the humanitarian situation in the facility is deteriorating rapidly.

Hundreds of migrants and asylum seekers were intercepted by the Libyan Coast guard in recent weeks. Some are now being freed and others are being handed over to detention centres, we know at least 3 cases. UNSMIL continued to receive reports of indefinite arbitrary detention of migrants and refugees, extortion and beating, trafficking and inhumane conditions of detention including severe overcrowding and shortages of food and water. Urgent funding for the 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan is necessary to allow us to continue to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable in Libya including migrants.

Mr. President,

It is notable that in response to my 29 July call for a truce there was an explicit and positive response by the Government of National Accord as well as a positive though unilateral and conditioned response from General Haftar. As a result of the truce, there was the substantial reduction in violence along the main fronts in southern Tripoli and elsewhere. There were certainly some violations, but broadly speaking, the truce held for the duration of the Eid festivities.

Despite the subsequent relapse of violence, the principle has been established that both parties can commit to a prolonged truce and without a doubt the wide and public support of the international community played an important role in the lull in the fighting.

We are working to build on the Eid al Adha truce through confidence-building measures to establish a deeper and more prolonged ceasefire. When such a ceasefire takes place, it will be necessary that it is sufficiently robust to enable stability for the benefit of Libyans and a return to the political process. In this regard, I would encourage the Council to consider adding a provision to the Mission's mandate to enable scaleable ceasefire support for whatever form of further truce or cessation of hostilities is agreed between the parties.

The violence in Libya is exacerbated by the supply of additional arms, ammunition and war materiel into the country. Violations of the arms embargo have been both routine and often blatant by both of the main parties to the conflict and their respective sponsor Member States. The Panel of Experts is reportedly investigating over 40 cases of varying magnitude, despite non-cooperation by most of the perpetrator Member States. It is sadly true to say that the arms embargo has been ineffective since 4 April 2019 and that there have been no interdictions or searches conducted at sea, despite such activities being authorised by resolution 2473. The reported recent arrival of thousands of mercenaries into the country risks the further extension and escalation of the conflict.

Mr. President,

We continue to mobilize national and international support for a further cessation of hostilities and renewed dialogue. After a long tour in the East of the country, my Political Deputy recently visited Misrata as part of our engagement with communities across Libya. As combat fatigue has become more prevalent on the ground, we are working to build confidence between the parties. Despite the bellicose rhetoric and strong polarization in the country, there is popular support for an end to the violence, including by the actual fighters. In fact, the fighters are sometimes more sensitive to the idea of ending the conflict than some of the politicians. Confidence-building measures between the different groups engaged in the conflict include: the exchange of prisoners, exchanges of mortal remains, family visits to prisoners and in some cases phone calls to establish proof of life.

In parallel, I have started an intensive campaign with international stakeholders in order to reach consensus for an international meeting of concerned parties that would contribute - through an unequivocal message - to ending the conflict and resuming the political process. To support this goal, I visited Germany, Malta, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Tunisia and two days ago I had lengthy and constructive discussions with leading officials in Cairo. I intend to continue my tour in the days ahead starting with the Arab Maghreb.

I am particularly grateful for the strong message delivered by the Group of 7 major powers calling for an international conference bringing together all the stakeholders and regional actors relevant to the conflict in Libya as well as for the recognition that only a political solution can ensure Libya's stability. It remains abundantly clear that without the commitment of key external actors engaged in Libya, the conflict will continue.

The international conference is the second step in my three-point initiative. We would like the international community to use this meeting to send a strong message on the need for respect of the arms embargo, to commit to non-interference in Libyan affairs, and to address the main causes of conflict as formulated by the Libyans themselves and to emphasise its clear and active support for whatever political formula the Libyans agree to. An international meeting, with the active support of our partners from the concerned regional organisations, therefore remains a sine qua non to gain the commitment necessary by the main external stakeholders to end the conflict and resume a Libyan-owned political process.

The statement was criticized by a number of Libyan commentators as some of the signatories of the statement, France and the UAE, are seen as two of the main backers of the Khalifa Hafter side. The US, under the Trump administration, is also seen as playing a passive role in the Libya conflict. The signatories have also come for criticism for failing to enforce the UNSC arms embargo.

Here is the full text:

The governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States welcome the announcement of a truce in Libya on the occasion of Eid el-Adha in response to the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General (SRSG) with the support of the Security Council (UNSC press statement on Libya of 11 August), and invite all parties to effectively cease hostilities across Libya. We stand ready to assist the UN Mission in monitoring the observance of the truce and address any attempt to break it.

As proposed by the SRSG and reaffirmed today (Sunday) by the Security Council, this truce should be accompanied by confidence-building measures between the parties that can pave the way for a sustainable cease-fire and a return to a constructive, inclusive dialogue.

The governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States recall the obligation under international law for all UN Member States to abide by the arms embargo, in line with all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.

We call on all parties to start working with no delay on a ceasefire agreement and resume efforts, under the auspices of the Special Representative of the United Nations, to build a lasting political solution, based on the principles agreed upon in Paris, Palermo, and Abu Dhabi.

The governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States, reaffirm their strong commitment to a quick and peaceful resolution of the Libyan crisis. We reiterate that there can be no military option in Libya, and we urge all parties to protect civilians, safeguard Libya's oil resources, and protect its infrastructure.

The governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States condemn in the strongest terms the attack that targeted a UN convoy in Benghazi yesterday. The circumstances of this vicious act must be established with no delay and those who were behind it must be identified and held accountable. We reiterate their full support to the essential work of the UN Mission in Libya.

He said that the scope of Libya's violence has spread and intensified.

He reported an increased use of foreign mercenaries, heavy weapons and ground attacks by both sides. Both sides were also ignoring International Humanitarian Laws.

Salame called for all migrants to be freed from detention centres and called on forces defending Tripoli to stop using Mitiga airport for military purposes and for Hafter's forces to stop targeting the airport.

He discouraged the formation of the breakaway Tripoli-based House of Representatives and reported that foreign governments support the sending of weapons to Libya which has been instrumental in intensifying the war: ""Libyans are fighting wars of others"", he added.

Salame warned of the weaponization of Libya's oil and called for a ""monopoly over force of arms"" and a unified army.

Here are his remarks in full:

Before beginning my briefing, I would like to pay tribute to the late President of Tunisia Beji Caid Essebsi. President Essebsi was a great supporter of the United Nations and was an active and committed partner to the UN Support Mission in Libya in our efforts to end the Libyan crisis through Tunisia's generous hosting of the Mission. I will personally miss his wisdom, frankness and friendship. He will be greatly missed. Allah yarhumo.

The armed conflict in Libya shows no signs of abating. The war around Tripoli has already left nearly 1100 dead, including 106 civilians. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in the capital and neighbouring districts as a result of the fighting, tens of thousands crossing the border to Tunisia seeking safety for their families.

More than 100,000 men, women and children are immediately exposed to the frontlines, and over 400,000 more in areas directly impacted by clashes. The war has worsened humanitarian conditions and hindered access to food, health and other life-saving services.

The parties, ignoring calls for de-escalation, have intensified air campaigns, with precision airstrikes by aircraft and armed drones.

The geographical scope of the violence has also spread. For the first time on 26 July, Government of National Accord forces launched an air attack on the main rear base of the LNA in the Jufra region. On 27 July, General Haftar's forces launched airstrikes at a Government of National Accord airbase in Misrata.

There is increased recruitment and use of foreign mercenaries, alongside the use of heavy weapons and ground attacks. Forces on both sides have failed to observe their obligations under international humanitarian law.

The most tragic example of indiscriminate attacks was the airstrike that hit a migrant detention centre in Tajoura on 2 July, killing 53 and injuring at least 87, including children. What is even more appalling is that the precise coordinates of the Tajoura detention centre, and other such centres, were shared by the UN with the parties following a previous incident in May. While the vast majority of the fatalities were due to the airstrike, several victims were cruelly struck down by those guarding the center as they attempted to flee. To make matters worse, following UN supported efforts to move the migrants to more secure locations, authorities have in recent days deposited more than 200 migrants back into the bombed facility.

Mr. President,

The tragedy of up to 150 migrant deaths at sea on 25 July again underlines the urgent need to address the root causes of the migrant issue and their immediate suffering.

The UN humanitarian agencies have worked hard to mitigate the terrible conditions in these detention centers. Over 5,000 refugees and migrant people are currently being held at detention centres run by a government agency, of which 3800 are exposed to the fighting. What is required is that they be shuttered. Towards this end, I urge the Council now to call upon the authorities in Tripoli to take the long-delayed but much needed strategic decision to free those who are detained in these centers. UNSMIL has devised a plan for an organized and gradual closure of all detention centers and seeks your support for its implementation.

So far, in 2019, nearly 4,500 refugees and migrants were disembarked in Libya, with serious risks of detention, arbitrary arrest and being trapped by the fighting. The international community can prevent another tragedy. I urge European countries to respond to the Secretary-General's repeated pleas, revisit policies and move migrants and refugees to safety.

Mr. President, I note with alarm the increasing frequency of attacks on Mitiga airport, which serves as the only functioning airport in the greater Tripoli area. Several of these attacks have come perilously close to hitting civilian aircraft with passengers on board. I am afraid that with the almost daily bombardment, luck will run out. I call upon the authorities in Tripoli to cease using the airport for military purposes and for the attacking forces to halt immediately their targeting of it.

Mr President,

On June 26, pro-GNA force retook the city of Gheryan, located some 80 kilometers south of Tripoli. It was a notable development as Gheryan was the first city that the LNA forces entered on their march to Tripoli. There are unconfirmed allegations that human rights abuses may have taken place in the town, which we are investigating.

The recent uptick in violence may worryingly presage a new phase in the military campaign but I do not judge that this will fundamentally alter the strategic stalemate. The parties still believe they can achieve their objectives through military means. Prime Minister Serraj and General Haftar have publicly reaffirmed their commitment to a future political and electoral process but have yet to take practical steps to stop the fighting. The LNA maintains that they will not stop their attack until Tripoli is conquered while the GNA forces insist they can push General Haftar's forces back to eastern Libya.

Libya's present and future need not be taken hostage by the warring parties. While engaging with political leaders and armed groups, UNSMIL is also actively engaging a wide range of constituencies and hosting second track dialogues.

From 13 to 15 July, a meeting gathering 72 Members of the House of Representatives under the auspices of the Egyptian Parliament affirmed the role of the House in a political solution to the Libyan crisis, and called for the formation of a government of national unity without any mention of the need to cease all hostilities. While I commend the efforts of those who met in Cairo to seek an end to the conflict and to form a unified government, I urge them to reach out to their fellow MPs to forge a truly national project. I discourage the trend towards establishing a parallel parliament in Tripoli.

In the same vein, I am troubled by the insistence of authorities in eastern Libya to press forward with the establishment of a parallel municipal elections committee to the national body for municipal elections which already exists. Efforts to delegitimize the work of the national body short-change Libyan voters themselves given the paucity of expertise and resources available to the parallel institutions, cause confusion at the local level, and ultimately impede the country's fragile transition to democracy.

Mr. President,

The hatred and invective on social media and satellite television stations is fueling the violence on the ground. I note that the owners and editors-in-chief of these publications and television stations have invited individuals using a despicable vocabulary of incitement; aired and published calls to violence and assassinations; spread intentionally false news and allowed ad hominem attacks. I urge those who dwell in their self-contained silos of enmity to cease spewing hatred and start talking face-to-face with their compatriots.

Mr. President,

Libya has become a terrain of experimentation of new military technologies and recycling of old weapons. Armed drones, armoured vehicles and pick-up trucks fitted with heavy armaments machine guns, recoilless rifles, mortar and rocket launchers have been recently transferred to Libya with the complicity and indeed outright support of foreign governments. The weapons discovered after the retaking of Gheryan illustrated the advanced systems that are provided. There is no doubt that external support has been instrumental in the intensification of airstrikes.

Without the full cooperation of all Member States regarding the implementation of the measures related to the arms embargo in accordance with Security Council resolution 2473, the flow of weapons to Libya will continue to fuel this needless conflict.

The security vacuum created by the conflict in and around Tripoli continues to be exploited by Da'esh in remote areas in the country's southern and central regions. Among other incidents, Da'esh claimed responsibility on 2 June for a car bomb attack in Derna which resulted in 11 wounded.

Even more worrisome are the indications that the arsenal of weapons being delivered by foreign supporters to one side or the other is either falling into the hands of terrorist groups or being sold to them. Some extremist elements have sought to legitimize themselves by joining the battle. This is nothing short of a recipe for disaster, not only for the safety and security of Libyans themselves, but to Libya's neighbors and international peace and security. It is high time the warring parties cease all hostilities, redeploy their forces, and focus on the common threat before Libya becomes more of a safe haven for terrorist organizations. While I can report that some heed has been recently taken of our warnings, the parties must be urged to decisively disassociate themselves from any violent extremist elements and to actively prevent them from joining the conflict.

Mr. President,

While UNSMIL had to reduce its footprint in Libya due to the security situation, I have also decided that the Mission should not leave Libya. This allows the UN to respond to growing humanitarian needs and human rights concerns, and to remain fully engaged with all interlocutors regarding de-escalation of the fighting and the resumption of the political process.

Since the start of the conflict in and around Tripoli, the UN, in support of local efforts, has provided humanitarian assistance to over 75,000 people. I regret to report that only 30 per cent of the $202 million requested under the 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan has been received to date. The humanitarian community will be unable to respond to increased needs and assist some 100,000 highly vulnerable people impacted by the conflict if no additional funding is received.

Critical infrastructure and vital installations providing water, electricity and other essential services to the population have been damaged by the war. With Libya already in peak demand during the hot summer, deficits in water and electricity supplies have been aggravated by the fighting and deliberate attacks targeting the Man Made River facilities. While Libya's oil continues to flow, the risks to its continued production are as grave as those that imperil the supply of water and electricity. Earlier this month, the National Oil Corporation declared force majeure after valves in the Hamada area were closed by an armed group. The

Mission used its good offices to facilitate a quick resolution to the dispute and force majeure was lifted several days later.

The parallel eastern National Oil Corporation continues its efforts to sell oil in violation of Security Council resolutions. There is a serious danger of the weaponization of oil in this conflict, the consequences of which would be disastrous to the Libyan economy.

The conflict situation has limited the ability of Libyan authorities to meet the basic needs of the population. International and national humanitarian partners provide emergency relief, including in response to floods in Ghat in early June. I led an exceptional humanitarian visit to Ghat on 13 June, where UN agencies delivered emergency food, water and sanitation supplies amongst other provisions needed in the town.

The situation in the South of the country is dire, with a rise in communal violence, particularly in the city of Murzuq. Southern communities face terrible fuel and electricity shortages and an absence of bank notes, in addition to a renewed security vacuum and an increase in terrorist attacks.

UNSMIL has re-established an operational presence in the East, with the re-opened UN hub in Benghazi. My deputy for political affairs conducted an eight-day mission to the east, covering 1,000 kilometers and visiting five cities to demonstrate UNSMIL's commitment to serving all Libyans. We are working hard to open similar hub in Sebha, the capital of the South.

Mr. President,

In the course of the current fighting, serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by all parties have been committed. Residential areas have been hit by indiscriminate shelling and targeted airstrikes. I am particularly worried to see that health workers and facilities are repeatedly targeted, with 19 ambulances and four health facilities struck, many medical doctors and health workers killed including 5 yesterday and others wounded. Impunity should not prevail especially for those who attack hospitals and ambulances. Protecting civilians and humanitarian workers requires sanctions against those committing crimes.

There has been an unacceptable spike in enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions since the outset of hostilities. On 17 July, elected House of Representatives member Siham Sergewa was violently abducted from her home in Benghazi by an unknown group. I have raised Ms. Sergewa's case with the authorities in the east, including yesterday with General Haftar. Ms. Sergewa must be immediately released and those responsible for her abduction must be held accountable. Abductions have also risen at an alarming rate in Tripoli, with numerous government officials, including the Deputy Director of Food and Drugs Administration kidnapped by armed groups to settle scores and extort ransoms.

Mr. President,

Nearly four months into third war since 2011 -- it should be abundantly clear to all that the risks of either an open-ended low-intensity conflict or a full escalation to outright war on the shores of the southern Mediterranean are equally unacceptable.

The decision to stop the war cannot be postponed indefinitely. I therefore submit the following three-part immediate action out of the conflict:

First, I call for a truce to be declared for the Eid al-Adha, which will fall on or about August 10. The truce should be accompanied by confidence-building measures between the parties to include the exchange of prisoners, release of those arbitrarily detained or abducted, and the exchange of mortal remains.

Second, and following the truce, I request a high-level meeting of concerned countries to: cement the cessation of hostilities, work together to enforce the strict implementation of the arms embargo to prevent the further flow of weapons to the Libyan theatre; and promote strict adherence to international humanitarian and human rights law by Libyan parties.

Third, the international meeting should be followed by a Libyan meeting of leading and influential personalities from all over the country to agree on comprehensive elements for the way forward. Such a consensus was on the verge of being built in the run-up to the National Conference in April. It is past time for Libyans to end this long season of mutual suspicion, fear and division.

This triple action will require consensus in this Council and amongst the Member States who exert influence on the ground.

As for the Libyans, they need to listen to their better angels. They are now fighting the wars of others and in so doing destroying their country.

Proposals to revive political talks should be the basis for re-unification of Libyan national institutions. I believe a comprehensive solution to the Libyan conflict will require tackling the underlying drivers of what is ultimately, through not exclusively, a war over resources. The solution, therefore, will need to factor in much-needed structural economic reform and an equitable method to distribute the country's vast wealth.

We have taken a step forward in reinvigorating the audit of the central bank and its parallel eastern branch which will be vital in promoting the unification of the bank and increasing transparency on how national funds are being spent. We have also devised concrete proposals to allow the largest number of Libyans benefit from oil rent, replacing predation with fairness, and self-interested disbursement with welfare for all.

Robust efforts will also be required to combat the smuggling of people, fuel, weapons and drugs - sources of wealth for the armed groups and associated criminal elements. Measures must also be taken to combat the rampant corruption which has infested almost all elements of the state.

Economic reform should be coupled with comprehensive reform of the security sector that would allow Libyan authorities to fight terrorism and secure the country's borders.

Structural security issues, namely the fragmentation of armed groups and the proliferation of small arms, combined with the absence of a unified and professional army have not been addressed since the fall of the former regime. The Libyan state cannot be effective without having an undisputed monopoly over force of arms; this will require collection of weapons outside of the control of the state and a clear civilian oversight over the security structures. Much of the groundwork for these efforts was laid during the military unification talks sponsored by the Egyptian government in addition to the UNSMIL supported steps taken following last September's violence in Tripoli to reinforce and reform the Interior Ministry. We urgently need to revive that momentum.

Stopping the war requires the will of the parties and the support of the international community. Should the parties agree to silence the guns, the UN and international partners should stand ready to provide material and technical support enabling the parties to negotiate a comprehensive agreement on cessation of hostilities and appropriate mechanisms for its implementation and monitoring. Since the outbreak of the conflict, national governments and regional organizations have called on the Libyan parties to stop the fighting and resume the political process. For that, I am deeply appreciative of the efforts of the African Union, the European Union and the League of Arab States.

People in Libyan cities stop me to convey a clear message: The majority of Libyans believe that it is now time for the Security Council to join this chorus and decisively call for an end to this needless war before it grows into a full-blown civil war with serious, potentially existential consequences for Libya and its neighbours.

Almost seventy years ago, the United Nations decided to create an independent Libya. This body bears a particular responsibility to ensure that Libya does not fracture into weak and unstable pieces but remains the collected strength of the Libya that united in 1951. Only with your imprimatur we can together help the Libyans move past this dark and violent episode and towards a more hopeful and promising future.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Tunisia', 'Libya', 'Tajura', 'Jufra District', 'Misrata', 'Cairo', 'Murzuq District', 'Sabha, Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Derna, Libya']","Ghassan Salame to UNSC: ""Libyans are fighting wars of others"".

11398272,2019-05-27,"The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate as a direct result of the armed conflict in and around Tripoli the latest UN Libya Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) report says. The World Health Organization, meanwhile, reported today that there have been 562 deaths (including 40 civilians) and 2,855 wounded (including 106 civilians) as a result of the greater Tripoli conflict that started on 4 April.

Meanwhile, fifty-odd days on, on the battlefield, the two opposing sides in the Tripoli fighting seem to be stuck in a general stalemate as neither side is able to impose itself on the battlefield. If anything, the Khalifa Hafter aligned forces seem to have lost their momentum having been steadily pushed back from the edges of Ain Zara, Wadi Rabea, Swani and Azizia to beyond the old Tripoli International Airport.

On the humanitarian front, the OCHA report says that health personnel and facilities continue to be impacted by the armed conflict, in violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) with two health workers were killed and three others injured on 23 May when two clearly marked armoured ambulance vehicles were struck in the Airport Road area of Tripoli, it adds.

One ambulance was struck, immediately killing a doctor on board and a second ambulance, dispatched to recover casualties from the first attach, was subsequently also struck by shelling, killing one paramedic and injuring two others and a doctor on board.

The report says that to date, 6 health workers have been killed, 7 health workers have been injured, 14 ambulances have been impacted and 2 health facilities have been impacted/evacuated as a result of armed conflict.

These incidents, it explains, further hamper the ability of already overstretched health services to provide vital assistance to civilians, including those injured as a result of armed conflict. It reminds IHL obligates all parties to take constant care to spare civilians and civilian objects, including medical personnel and assets. Deliberate attacks on clearly marked medical transports constitute war crimes under IHL, the report reiterates.

The report says that during the overnight hours of 21-22 May, indiscriminate shelling was reported in a residential area in Tripoli's Salah Al-Deen district. On the morning of 22 May, indiscriminate shelling was reported in a residential area of Tajura. No civilian casualties were reported as a result of these incidents. The report notes that after peaking in mid/late-April, the instances of random shelling of residential areas (with no ostensible military target nearby) had in recent weeks abated. This has coincided with the increase in precision airstrikes carried out by unmanned aerial vehicles.

Humanitarian agencies, the report added, continue to remind parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law to take all feasible measures to avoid civilian harm, and call on all parties to refrain from using explosive weapons - including by aerial bombardment or shelling - in populated areas, given their likely indiscriminate effect.

The report says that according to latest figures, at least 82,300 individuals have fled their homes (internally displaced - IDP) since the start of the conflict. Of these, approximately half are believed to be children. The rate of displacement has decreased somewhat since the start of the conflict, yet armed conflict continues to drive more and more families from their homes. There are now 47 collective shelters in operation, estimated to house some 800 IDP families (approximately 4,000 individuals), with the majority of IDPs staying in urban areas with family/friends or in rented accommodation, mainly in urban areas of Tripoli.

Many other IDPs have moved to areas along the coastal line of Western Libya and the Nafusa mountains. IDP destinations, including collective shelters, are themselves often close to armed clashes, thus risking secondary displacement and meaning that many IDPs and their host communities remain at risk, the report says.

Humanitarian actors estimate that over 100,000 men, women and children remain in immediate frontline areas, with over 400,000 more in areas directly impacted by clashes (within a one-kilometre radius of the front). Concerns are high for civilians unable to leave these areas, as conditions deteriorate, and emergency services are unable to get through. Water and electricity cuts are being reported from frontline areas, while market access and availability of food is very limited.

Refugees and migrants in urban areas are especially at-risk, as they face discrimination in accessing collective shelters and other services. Humanitarian actors continue to appeal for a humanitarian truce to allow civilians trapped in conflict areas to move freely to safer areas and for assistance to reach those in urgent need.

Humanitarian actors are extremely concerned for the safety and wellbeing of nearly 3,400 refugees and migrants trapped in ten detentions centres (DCs) exposed to, or in close proximity to, the fighting. All individuals inside these centres are at imminent risk, as they have no means of seeking safety on their own. In addition to the risk posed by armed clashes, access to food, water and healthcare is severely restricted at these facilities as a result of the conflict.

Humanitarian actors continue to call for detained refugees and migrants to be released and provided with safe shelter until their asylum claims can be processed or they can be provided with safe repatriation assistance for reunification with their families.

On 20 May, the Humanitarian Coordinator issued a statement condemning the deliberate cut off of water supply to Tripoli and other north-western cities, potentially impacting upwards of 2 million people, by an armed group who stormed a water control station of the Man-Made River Project (MMRP) in Jabal al-Hasawna the previous day.

On 21 May, the water supply to Tripoli was restored. This was the latest in a series of similar incidents in recent years whereby the same armed group has used the threat of cutting off water supply to Tripoli unless authorities meet its demands, which reportedly revolve around the release of an arrested family member of the group's leader. While not directly related to the Humanitarian actors are also concerned that responsible local authorities are not able to access primary landfill sites in conflict affected areas, leading to a build-up of solid waste in Tripoli. With the summer season approaching this will lead to foul smells and a favourable environment for vector breeding.

A rapid assessment of market access in conflict affected areas in and around Tripoli found that food security varies significantly according to proximity to clashes, with the area of Kallet Al Furjan and Swani Bin Adam municipality being the worst affected locations. Overall, 26 per cent of markets in assessed areas were reported to be closed, while insecurity directly prevented residents from accessing markets in Al Aziziya, Salah Al-Deen, Gaser Ben Ghasheer and Suq Al Khamis.

The report said that prices of fresh vegetables has increased by 20 per cent in Tripoli markets since the start of the conflict, due in part to the fact that agricultural areas to the south of Tripoli have been cut off behind frontlines, while prices for other items such as milk and cooking oil have also increased. Prices of key staples such as bread, rice and couscous have remained stable. The report noted that some of these increases in food prices may be in some part due to increased demand during the fasting month of Ramadan.

The report says that Tripoli port was temporarily closed on 19 May, reopening the following day. Reportedly, it adds, the port was closed due to the arrival of 'special cargo'. This is a coded confirmation and reference by the OCHA report of the arrival of armoured vehicles at Tripoli port.

During the reporting period, the Libyan National Army (LNA) also announced a 'total maritime ban' on ports in the western region although the LNA is not thought to have capacity to enforce such a ban. Disruption of port operations could severely hamper humanitarian response, the report adds.

Humanitarian partners continue to express concern over lengthy delays and inconsistencies in the import and customs clearance of humanitarian cargo entering Libya and call for the fast tracking of aid shipments to ensure timely delivery to affected populations, the report says.

The OCHA report says that the impact of clashes is being felt outside of Tripoli, as more IDPs arrive in other areas and disruptions in humanitarian access and in transportation of essential goods such as food and fuel exacerbate already existing scarcities. Trucks carrying humanitarian assistance targeting populations in areas under LNA control, particularly in the east, continue to be denied permission by GNA-affiliated authorities to move from Tripoli.

The report adds that the lack of cash liquidity is also exacerbating the need of affected populations, especially in the south. The LNA-imposed no-fly zone in the south has interrupted distribution of cash to banks in the south outside of Sebha, impacting the ability of populations already facing scarcities to obtain food and other basic goods.

Areas south of Ain Zara, Khallat Al-Furjan, Aziziya, Wadi Rabea and Gaser Ben Ghasheer remain largely inaccessible to humanitarian actors due to fighting and random shelling. OCHA is supporting humanitarian access through establishment of a new reporting mechanism, whereby humanitarian actors will be able to report access constraints as they transpire to OCHA who will then engage with relevant parties to alleviate, or mitigate the impact of, reported constraints.

Humanitarian partners continue to provide assistance, where access allows. Over 45,600 people have received assistance since the start of the conflict. However insufficient access and funding are impeding response operations, the report says.

The report says that to date, Child Protection partners have reached approximately 5,700 conflict-affected children with PSS/recreational activities and 1,025 conflict-affected children with specialized PSS in collective shelters and in urban areas.

On the political front

On another note, UNSMIL welcomed on Saturday the release of Mohamed Alqarj and Mohamed Al-shaibani, journalists from Libya Al-Ahrar TV, and their safe return to their families in Zintan. It reiterated its calls for all others arbitrarily arrested and detained in Libya to be immediately released.

On Sunday UNSMIL said that it was deeply concerned at a series of serious incidents which had taken place in the last few days in and around Tripoli.

It said that it was very concerned at the report of the kidnapping of a member of the High State Council from the Gaser Ben Ghashir neighbourhood in Tripoli. It also said that it was equally concerned regarding the airstrike on the Rixos compound in Tripoli, a civilian facility located in a high populated area that has been used by members of the House of Representatives for meetings. Shelling civilian targets and the kidnapping of civilians including political actors sends a worryingly anti-democratic message, it added.

On the reported two attacks against ambulances carrying medical staff causing the death of two health workers and injury to others are of serious concern, it reiterated that medical facilities and personnel are strictly protected under IHL and these attacks could constitute war crimes.

It reported that it is working with parties on the ground to acquire the evidence necessary to prosecute all of those proved to have been involved in these violations and all other incidents against the civilian population and civilian infrastructure.

UNSMIL also called again for all those arbitrarily detained and abducted to be immediately released and reminded all parties to the conflict of their obligations under the International Humanitarian Law and the International Human Rights Law.

On the battlefront: The Pro GNA narrative

Meanwhile, on the battlefront, the pro Faiez Serraj Presidency Council and Government of National Accord Volcano of Anger/Rage Operation Room and (pro Tripoli) Libyan Army reported on Saturday that despite fifty-two days since the aggressive attack on the capital by the ''outlaw and war criminals'', the capital is still holding.

It reported that pro Hafter air force continued on Friday night its ''brutal aggression targeting public institutions and neighbourhoods in the capital Tripoli, after the crime of bombing the Libyan parliament building legislative authority in the country''.

They claimed that on dawn of the 20th of Ramadan (25 May), their forces managed to ''lure the outlaw forces into a tight ambush, and enabled them to sneak into the Al-Naqlea military base before attacking them from the ground and the air, and teach them a harsh lesson that will be remembered by those who survived''.

They claimed that their forces destroyed the pro Hafter forces' ''foreign armoured vehicles and seized a number of the vehicles''. They added that those under illusions should know that the victors will be those defending their homeland and not those with foreign equipment.

They reported that their Air Force carried out eight combat missions on Saturday, ''targeting armoured vehicles and the fleeing elements from the battlefield'', which was able to implement ''direct strikes that facilitated the resolution of the battle with a clear victory''.

On the southern frontline they claimed that their forces continue to patrol the desert and cut off the supply roads of the ''outlaw and war criminal Hafter'', including the Shwerif area where they combed and ''arrested those involved in the (Hafter) failed coup''.

If the claims by the pro GNA forces to have some control of the Shwerif intersection are correct, this would be a great gain by them as the road is an important link between the south and central Jufra area. This would be a key intersection for supplies to the Hafter forces either via the south or from the east through Jufra. If they can move northwards towards Gharian they could pincer the LNA forces and isolate them.

Finally, the pro GNA forces concluded by promising the now obligatory: ''Victory is coming soon''.

The pro LNA narrative

The pro LNA forces continue their minimalist approach to giving out battle details stressing the need for strategic secrecy. However, this week the LNA War Information Division claimed their forces are still in Gharian and had taken control of the Wildlife Open Zoo area off Airport Road.

The LNA claim that their forces are ''progressing at a steady pace in all the axes of fighting in the capital Tripoli and achieving victories'' and enjoying ''epics of heroism in the battlefields''.

On Saturday they claimed they were making ''progress has been on all axes, the most important of which is the Tripoli International Airport Road'' where they inflicted ''many casualties, forcing them to flee and leave their positions. Progress is still ongoing'', they claimed.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Zadar', 'Libya', 'Tajura', 'Zintan', 'Sabha, Libya']","As fighting remains in stalemate, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate as a result of the Tripoli fighting",https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/05/27/as-fighting-remains-in-stalemate-the-humanitarian-situation-continues-to-deteriorate-as-a-result-of-the-tripoli-fighting/,None,
11398273,2019-04-17,"The EU's High Representative Federica Mogherini called for an immediate ceasefire in the Tripoli fighting and reiterated that there can be no military solution to the Libyan crisis. She said there should be a return to dialogue through the UNSMIL-facilitated National Conference:

He was speaking yesterday at the plenary session of the European Parliament on the situation in Libya.

Mogherini said the National Conference still represents the hope of an entire country and that the offensive against Tripoli has been and is still ''an attack against hope, an attack against the concrete perspective of achieving peace in Libya''. She called for humanitarian corridors to be opened urgently and for the full respect of humanitarian international law.

Here is her full speech:

''The recent escalation in Libya started at a moment just when the possibility for peace was becoming real. The LNA [Libyan National Army], led by General [Khalifa] Haftar, attacked Tripoli at the very time when UN Secretary-General [Antonio] Guterres was visiting the country, and on the eve of the National Conference, a Conference that still has the potential to represent a new beginning for Libya.

The European Union has worked for almost one year, very closely together with the United Nations and the [UN] Special Envoy [Ghassan Salamé], to prepare the ground for a Libyan led and Libyan owned National Conference that would prepare the ground for elections under the appropriate legal and constitutional conditions.

We have seen, day by day, the aspiration, the readiness, and the desire of all the Libyan people - the citizens of Libya - to move their country forward, to turn the page, to unite and build unity and peace. A country that has potentially an enormous capacity to move forward and a lot of resources and of potential.

The National Conference still represents the hope of an entire country. Just a few days before that military escalation took place, I was myself together with [Antonio] Guterres, with the Secretary General of the League of Arab States [Abu Gheit], with the Chairperson of the African Union [Commission, Moussa Faki] and Ghassan Salamé, the UN Special Envoy, in Tunis in the margins of the League of Arab States Summit, reaffirming the unity of the international community to support this Libyan led, Libyan owned political process that would have helped turning the page and uniting the country in peace.

The offensive against Tripoli has been and is still an attack against hope, an attack against the concrete perspective of achieving peace in Libya.

We have seen this happening before: When peace becomes a real possibility, concrete, possible, it is also when the resistance against peace gets stronger and more evident.

Now we are facing a protracted conflict, with victims in high numbers - including civilians - and a stalemate on the ground. A situation on the ground that is blocked in terms of the line of the conflict but still very active in terms of clashes with the use of arms that we should not be seen used in Libya.

This confirms what we have always known in Europe and in the international community, at least in the recent years: there is and there cannot be any military solution to the Libyan conflict. If the war continues, it will only lead to greater suffering. If someone continues to seek military victory, everybody will lose.

The only scenario where the whole country, where all Libyans, in an inclusive and unified manner moves forward, is a negotiated political solution. If the Libyan parties will not seek a win-win solution, that the international community starting from the European Union would be ready to accompany and support, than all the people of Libya will continue to suffer and the entire region will continue to suffer.

I just spoke again, today, with the UN Special Envoy Ghassan Salamé. Our work is joined and the European Union supports his work on a daily basis. Our support to his work is - I would say - is even stronger today than it has ever been in the past, along three main lines on which the European Union and our Member States have acted united in these last weeks:

First, to affirm the need to open humanitarian corridors as a matter of urgency, and fully respect humanitarian international law.

Second, to establish an immediate ceasefire that I am sure the UN are ready to negotiate.

Third, to go back to the political track, with the holding of the National Conference as soon as possible to give Libyans, the Libyan people - men and women of all generations, of all cities and of the countryside of the country - the chance to outline the common way forward.

These are the three elements on which I am sure, for sure the European Union, for sure the United Nations, but I am also sure the rest of the international community will be ready to support and accompany the Libyan people.

Let me add that not only Libyans and not only the region are suffering. Refugees and migrants trapped in detention centres are also at risk. We are working with the IOM [International Organisation for Migration] and with the UNHCR [UN Refugees Agency] to evacuate them outside Libya, or to move them to safer places inside Libya.

The most recent flight that brought back home safely and voluntary tens of migrants left Tripoli just a few days ago. Our work with the UN agencies continues, but obviously, conditions on the ground are more and more difficult by the day.

This is also why we call on all parties to allow the swift and unconditional evacuation of the detention centres on the front line, as also requested by High Commissioner [Filippo] Grandi last week.

The work we have done together with the UN agencies with the help of the African Union and the Libyan authorities on the ground has brought enormous results in this last year with tens of thousands migrants voluntarily and safely repatriated through the work of the IOM, and those in need of international protection, protected through the UNHCR channels.

The conflict in Libya and the escalation from the military perspective - I know that some in Europe perceive it as a growing threat of growing flows. But first and foremost, it also represents a threat to the lives of those migrants and refugees that are trapped in Libya, whose life is more at risk than others, and for which with the UN agencies, we have been trying to work to try and save lives, and to try and empty the detention centres. The military offensive is also making this work more difficult.

To conclude, let me restate very clear that a swift return to the negotiating table is essential and still possible. We believe, more than ever, that the UN track and the National Conference are the only real opportunity for a peaceful resolution. The multiplication or proliferation of different initiatives may lead to distractions that definitely would not be helpful in this moment.

Humanitarian corridors and respect for the humanitarian international law, ceasefire negotiated by the UN and return to the negotiating table and the holding of the National Conference with the full participation of the Libyan people.

I would like to add that when I say Libyan people, I refer to Libyan men and women. Let me spend one word for praising the Libyan women that sometimes have been in the shadow, trying to accompany the political process so far, in difficult conditions. I believe that the European Union together with the United Nations have an interest, as in any conflict we face, to promote the role of women at the negotiating table, and in the reconciliation process on the ground.

This is what we are trying to contribute to achieve, to support the UN work, try to unite the Europeans. If in the past, we have seen different approaches, I believe today, all European Union Member States understand that our common work is required to avoid Libyans to turn in different directions and disaggregate the potential of unity through a political dialogue that is in their hands.

We have stated clearly last time last week the European Union united position on all these lines in the name of all the 28 Member States. I would now appeal to all regional and international players to unite in support of the United Nations work, of the political perspective for dialogue and unity in Libya, to avoid stakeholders themselves find external reasons for disuniting even further.

On the EU side, I can say that today, they find common, united front in support of the United Nations efforts to bring the parties around the table and define a common perspective for Libya in peace and security.''",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Tunis']","No military solution to Libyan crisis, need to return to dialogue says EU's Mogherini",https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/04/17/no-military-solution-to-libyan-crisis-need-to-return-to-dialogue-says-eus-mogherini/,None,
11398274,2019-04-08,"The Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National Accord launched its ''Volcano of Rage'' operation to counter the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA) offensive on Tripoli as Hafter seems to have lost the initial momentum. This official operation launched by Serraj seems to have replaced the ""Wadi Doum 2"" operation launched by the coalition of Western Region Forces.

The Volcano of Rage operation was announced yesterday in a televised statement read by Mohamed Gnunu, the Official Spokesperson for the Serraj-aligned Libyan Army. Gnunu was appointed on Saturday.

Meanwhile, sporadic and scattered fighting continued over the weekend as the Hafter forces attempted to penetrate Tripoli claiming to have reached as far as Salah Al-Deen and Al-Khala in south Tripoli. However, the anti Hafter forces seem to have pushed them back to as far as Tripoli International Airport and beyond. Inconclusive cat and mouse fighting has continued to-and-fro from Tripoli airport to Azizia.

The launch of operation Volcano of Rage came after Serraj had addressed the nation in a televised address Saturday night where he expressed surprise and betrayal by Hafter who he seemed to feel had genuinely agreed to a peaceful solution through the auspices of UNSMIL and through the forthcoming Ghadames National Conference to be held from 14-16 April.

Serraj said Libyans were looking forward to the Ghadames meeting with optimism and that he had made numerous compromises for the sake of the nation during talks with Hafter in their meetings in Rajma (Hafter's eastern Libya headquarters), Paris, Palermo and Abu Dhabi. Serraj now called for forces aligned to him to mobilize and defend Tripoli. He also vowed to take domestic and legal action against those who participate in the military action against Tripoli.

Internationally, he called on supporters of Hafter to stop interfering in Libya's affairs and called on the international community not to treat the aggressor (Hafter) on the same footing as the defenders of Tripoli.

Meanwhile, Gnunu said that the GNA-aligned forces were mobilizing and that an operations room to coordinate actions had been set up. He claimed that Tripoli International Airport and Checkpoint 27 km had been recaptured with a large cache of armoured vehicles and equipment. He accused the LNA media machine of propaganda and vowed to defend the civilian state and not allow a military state.

The fighting seemed to escalate as a no-fly-zone was announced by the Hafter LNA on Sunday who claimed that the Serraj-aligned forces conducted four airstrikes on Sunday at Azizia, Gharian and Al-Asabaa. LNA Spokesperson Ahmed Mesmari claimed there were no casualties. The LNA were in turn, reported to have carried out airstrikes against GNA forces at the Naqlia base on airport road.

The fighting reached a degree at one stage that UNSMIL called for a two-hour humanitarian ceasefire to enable the evacuation of civilians on the southern outskirts of Tripoli after reports of random shelling and civilian casualties.

Although much larger numbers have been quoted by numerous media sources, the Serraj Ministry of Health announced the final official death toll at 15 and 15 injured late last night, down from a higher earlier figure. These figures exclude those on the LNA side of operations. The Serraj Health Ministry also announced a state of emergency and full preparedness of hospitals and ambulances to receive the wounded. The IOM reported today that about 560 families or 2,800 individuals, have been displaced since the start of fighting last Wednesday.

The fluid situation on the ground continues with claims and counter-claims of advances and repulses. What is clear is that the Hafter forces have lost momentum and failed to make deep incursions into Tripoli while the counter-forces have failed to push Hafter back to or beyond Gharian. There are still unconfirmed reports (as well as photographs) of Misratan forces heading to the fronts.

This is important. If the main well-armed and battle-hardened Misratan militias do join the battle, it could change the whole scale and dynamics of the fighting and pose a huge threat to Hafter's LNA.

All this fighting and airstrikes came despite demands for restraint by the UN Security Council, the UK, France and the US.

AFRICOM confirmed that it had evacuated security personnel from Tripoli. it said that ""a contingent of U.S. forces supporting AFRICOM temporarily relocated from Libya in response to security conditions. We will continue to monitor conditions on the ground and assess the feasibility for renewed U.S. military presence, as appropriate"". The Italian embassy said that it is to remain open.

Yesterday, the United States said it was ''is deeply concerned about fighting near Tripoli. We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital. Forces should return to status quo ante positions. All involved parties have a responsibility to urgently de-escalate the situation, as the UN Security Council and G7 ministers emphasized on April 5. This unilateral military campaign against Tripoli is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans.

There is no military solution to the Libya conflict. This is why the United States continues to press Libyan leaders, together with our international partners, to return to political negotiations mediated by UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ghassan Salame. A political solution is the only way to unify the country and provide a plan for security, stability, and prosperity for all Libyans''.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Ghadames', 'Libya', 'Paris', 'Palermo', 'Abu Dhabi', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'Italy']",Serraj GNA launches ''Volcano of Rage'' anti-Hafter operation to defend Tripoli,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/04/08/serraj-gna-launches-volcano-of-rage-anti-hafter-operation-to-defend-tripoli/,None,
11398275,2019-04-05,"The Khalifa Hafter Libyan National Army (LNA) and its regional allies seemed to have ben repulsed overnight in their thrust towards Tripoli. The newly-formed Western Region coalition of anti-Hafter forces launched the ''Wadi (Ouadi) Doum 2'' operation to counter Hafter's attack on Tripoli.

Wadi Doum is a military airstrip build by Qaddafi in northern Chad where Hafter was defeated and captured by Chadian government forces fighting for the Qaddafi regime in 1986. Ironically, Hafter's defeat and capture in 1987 was facilitated by French support for the Chad government at the time.

Yesterday, pro Hafter media circulated video footage purporting to show pro-LNA forces capturing the strategic KM 27 checkpoint on the main coastal road between Tripoli and Zawia. Later last night, anti Hafter forces displayed footage purporting to show that KM 27 checkpoint was back in their hands.

Moreover, reports, photographs and video footage widely circulated purporting to show a large number of pro-Hafter troops under arrest by the anti-Hafter forces. These are put at around 150 held in Zawia.

It was claimed they surrendered without putting up any fight. They also claimed to have captured the surrendering forces' armour and vehicles. Faiez Serraj was also photographed by a fellow journalist today meeting troops at the KM 27 checkpoint, and the Tripoli-Zawia coastal road was reported to be normal this morning. There were brief clashes between the two forces reported in the Hira area at the foot of the Western Nefusa mountains yesterday. There are conflicting reports as to who controls the Witya airbase, near the Tunisian border and 75 km south of Zuwara.

More importantly, there were numerous reports and photos and video footage of of Misratan forces allegedly preparing to set off to Tripoli. There are still no confirmed reports this morning of their arrival in central Tripoli.

Petrol and diesel queues continue in Tripoli. In fairness, these started a few days prior to Hafter's arrival at Gharian, but Hafter's arrival has been the only topic of debate in Tripoli for weeks. Some would say for months and at least a couple of years. The NOC's Brega has assured that there are plenty of fuel supplies. One black-market currency dealer reported to Libya Herald that the dinar spiked to 4.90 to the dollar briefly yesterday.

A quick unscientific poll of people in Tripoli by Libya Herald this morning is as split and polarized as the British Brexit debate. Half want Hafter while the other half absolutely detest him. Tripoli is calm with many residents carrying on as normal today - as they had done all of yesterday.

On the international stage, following the earlier statements by the EU and the UN yesterday, a Joint Statement on the Fighting Near Gharian was released by the Governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States was released late last night.

It said that ''The governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States are deeply concerned by fighting near Gharyan, Libya and urge all parties to immediately de-escalate tensions, which are hindering prospects for UN political mediation. At this sensitive moment in Libya's transition, military posturing and threats of unilateral action only risk propelling Libya back toward chaos. We strongly believe that there is no military solution to the Libya conflict. Our governments oppose any military action in Libya and will hold accountable any Libyan faction that precipitates further civil conflict.

We stand united behind UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) Ghassan Salamé as the UN seeks to break Libya's political deadlock, improve transitional governance, and chart a path toward credible and peaceful elections. All Libyan actors should work constructively with SRSG Salamé as the UN finalizes plans for the national conference planned for April 14-16''.

11398584,2019-11-14,"The ""Libyan Economic Reforms"", which in reality were Fiscal Policy Reforms to address Monetary Policy failures have been and are a success story. The printing of new money by the Eastern Central Bank of Libya (CBL) branch of LD 10 billion and by the Western CBL of LD 18 billion and the selling of foreign currencies at a fraction of their market parity price resulted in 40 percent-plus of growth in Libya's money supply (M1).

All of Libya's monetary policy failures were due to the galvanization and polarisation of the seven CBL Board of Directors into two groups. (Three support the East, two support the West, one resigned and one position is contested between two Government of National Accord (west) and Interim Government (east) Ministry of Finance Undersecretaries). The result of this was rampant inflation and the erosion of the local currency; the Libyan Dinar (LD).

By November 2019, this week, the exchange rate is trading at LD 4.000 per US$ and the chequing premium is down to 3 percent at LD 4.120 per US$ - a drop of almost 50 percent.

The LD value versus the US$ almost doubled, likewise the purchasing power of the LD doubled, making most goods and services at 50% of September 2018 prices.

The strengthening of the local currency was a direct result of the foreign currency levy that was decreed in October 2018 by the Presidency Council President Faiez Serraj. The FX Fiscal Surcharge or Levy was then set at 183 percent and was reduced to 163 percent in March 2019.

But, be it by calculation or by mistake, the Levy was limited in scope. It was applied only to Commercial and Personal Transfers (a maximum of 10,000-00 US$ per person per year), it also applied to unlimited private education and hospitalization abroad. But it did not extend to ALL FX sales, leaving open a loophole for great potential misuse by the Government.

The sales of foreign currencies to government procurement offices and organizations, Ministries and their administration, health , education, subsidies, security, oil, travel, students, Ministry of Finance Affairs, the LIA and others, were exempt from the levy and sold foreign currency at the base rate of about 1.400 LD/US$.

The government allowed itself a loophole to benefit from a cheap US$ at the base rate totalling US$ 7 BILLION. The CBL had also taken liberty to exempt the so-called (Hard Currency Annual) ''Family Allowance'' of 1000-00 per annum accessible to every Libyan citizen at the favourable rate of 1.400 LD/US$. The total amount sold exceeded US$ 6.2 Billion in the first 10 months of 2019.

Last week, the CBL released its end of October 2019 bulletin, reporting its USD revenues and sales , Libyan Dinars fiscal budget revenues and expense .

The bulletin reported that the CBL had sold in total for commercial, personal, subsidies and government over US$ 21 billion in 10 months and it is likely to sell US$ 24 billion by year end.

The sale of US$ 8.2 billion with an FX levy of 165 percent for Commercial and Personal users realized for the state LD 30 billion. This is compared to US$ 12.8 Billion sold to the government ""free of any FX Levy"" including FX allocated for subsidies, in total realized a meagre LD 12 billion - less than an average of LD 1.000 per US$.

In conclusion, based on the above, had the head of the Presidency Council, Mr Faiez Serraj enforced the FX Levy on ALL private, Government, subsidy, and travel foreign currency sales and transactions - Libya would have now enjoyed:

To save Libya and its economy, the Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council has to extend the application of the FX Levy to ALL FX sold without exception. If implemented on all FX sales, we will see a stable, healthy growth of the Libyan economy in double digits - in a matter of months and in less than a year.

However, if the Presidency Council wants to benefit from a cheap, unsustainable US$ free of the FX levy, I am sad to say, we will have many more wars looming over the horizon with everyone trying to jump and grab what they can from the Libyan rentier state - all in the name of the Libyan people!

11398585,2019-10-30,"Libya's state-controlled and first mobile service provider, Al-Madar Aljadid, yesterday launched the first 5G mobile internet service in the country - and it claims in North Africa. 5G internet provides speeds of up to 1,200 MW/second.

Initially, the service will only be available in certain areas, but will be rolled out across the country over time.

Officially launching the service, internationally recognized Prime Minister of Libya, Faiez Serraj, said that the launch of the 5G service, is a path that will bring the country to smooth and continuous flow of information, and supports the government's aspirations to build a knowledge-based economy that responds to the needs of individuals and institutions in various fields.

He added that this is seen as a qualitative leap, aimed at improving the quality of telecommunications and information technology services, on which all service sectors depend in the transition to the digital economy, allowing citizens to achieve their aims more quickly and provide the right environment that encourages the building of young people's capacities.

Serraj said that despite the exceptional circumstances in which the country was going through, his government was moving forward on development tracks and working to improve citizens' living conditions.

""Today's achievement is complemented by other achievements that we seek to achieve in order to provide a decent life filled with prosperity and prosperity for our people,"" he concluded.

The introduction of the service was welcomed, but it also invited criticism that Al-Madar's previous service was patchy and did not live up to the advertised speeds.

It will also be recalled that internet and mobile connectivity rely on electricity and Libya's power cuts have added to the country's poor internet service. Madar's 4G service was also criticised for being quite expensive - exhausting mobile users credits very quickly.

Nevertheless, it is not easy for companies to operate and launch new services in Libya with the instability and fighting - and Al-Madar has been able to launch the 5G service despite the very challenging conditions.",Libya Herald,energy,,['Libya'],Al Madar launches Libya's first 5G mobile internet service - first in North Africa,https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/10/30/al-madar-launches-libyas-first-5g-mobile-internet-service-first-in-north-africa/,None,
11398586,2019-10-02,"The Tripoli-based Audit Bureau of Libya revealed yesterday that its committee, formed to investigate the causes of Libya's acute power cuts that have been plaguing the country since the 2011 revolution, will present its final report within the next ten days.

At a meeting held on Monday the interim findings were reviewed which revealed ''defects in the management and operation of existing power stations'' and the ''poor direction of the (General Electricity Company of Libya-GECOL) company's resources and budgets''.

The Audit Bureau committee also revealed that it had identified a number of cases of what it called ''deviations and neglect'' that had caused the ''reduced efficiency'' of many power generation units and resulted in the ''lower production of stations to less than half'' of their actual capabilities. There was also a threat that these could ''completely fail'' if the company continued to be run as it is.

The meeting also aimed to follow-up on GECOL's actions in the implementation of the electricity production plan approved by the Faiez Serraj government, which aims to raise capacity by more than 1,200 MW before the winter peak demand period.

Libya's inability to solve its electricity problem is a microcosm of the post revolution country which has a guaranteed annual oil income, yet has been unable now for eight years to solve its power supply problem.

GECOL have long admitted that there is a generation capacity deficit of about 2,000 MW, with its power stations only producing about 5,000 MW as opposed to a peak winter and summer demand of about 7,000 MW. This deficit has persisted despite the company receiving billions in state budgets.

The company blames the lack of security as the main cause of the continuing chronic power cuts

At a heated July press conference where it was attempting to gain public sympathy or understanding - but failed miserably - it confirmed a long list of outstanding contracts in place totalling 5,000 MW, that if completed, would wipe out the power cuts.

It admitted that these projects have been mostly stalled since 2011 despite GECOL trying on various occasions to get the contracting companies to return. For example, contractors had returned in 2013 only to leave in 2014, and they returned in 2015 only to be forced to leave again due to lack of security in 2016. The last example of this, GECOL pointed out, was the kidnapping of the Ubari plant foreign employees.

GECOL pointed to the example of Algeria and Egypt who had both a power generation deficit which they resolved in three years and now have generation surpluses.

Completing these stalled contracts is the solution to Libya's power shortage, GECOL had stressed. However, foreign contractors will not return with Libya's current security situation as their precondition to returning is the guarantee of security for their employees, it had explained.

GECOL had even admitted that some foreign companies sent their own security plans as a precondition to returning to Libya. GECOL had said they had approved these plans. It had said they were still trying to convince the foreign contractors to return and were hopefully some will return ""soon"".

Meanwhile, the Libyan public has become totally fed up with press conferences and is no longer interested in the excuses for the causes of the power cuts. They are unhappy with the billions allocated to GECOL without any apparent results.

It will be recalled that GECOL had signed an MoU with German energy generation giant Siemens in August 2017. The agreement was supposed to pave the way for the return of the German company to Libya to complete its many outstanding projects.

These include the completion of the Ubari power plant in southern Libya, which was over 90 percent complete, as well as providing urgently needed maintenance to a number of other power plants.

Well-placed sources had told Libya Herald that the agreement ''covers GECOL priorities and support that Siemens will provide especially with regards to fast-tracking the projects and giving high priorities to the service needs''. In reality, the agreement failed to solve Libya's electricity crisis.

Equally, on 25 September, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by the internationally recognized prime minister of Libya, Faiez Serraj, in New York with U.S power generation giant General Electric (GE).

The MoU entails the implement of new electric production capacity of 6,000 MW, raising the efficiency of existing power plants, the establishment of new renewable energy power generation projects (wind and solar), and power transportation projects.

The Tripoli-based Libyan government reported that MoU with GE International Gas Energy Systems pro

No mention was made of GE's existing stalled projects or of any newly suggested proposals as a solution to the ever-present problem of insecurity in Libya, which is seen as the main reason preventing most foreign contractors from returning to the country.

With this in mind, and no public clarification about what is different about this MoU on electricity, many critics have discussed the MoU as no more than a PR stunt.

The project is a joint venture between the two companies operated by NOC subsidiary Mellitah Oil & Gas Company (MOG).

The NOC said that production from the field's ninth well began earlier this month, while work on the last well is currently in progress.

It reported that phase 2 of the project increases field production from 995 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMSCFD) to 1,100 million MMSCFD and completes the phased development of Libya's largest offshore producing gas field.

The development of Libya's 'A' and 'E' offshore structures was discussed in Tripoli yesterday at the Tripoli governments Office at a meeting of Presidency Council and Government of National Accord head Faiez Sarraj, NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla and Eni's CEO Mr Claudio Descalzi.

This followed on from the approval of a field development and implementation plan in March this year.

The NOC said that the estimated total cost of the project is US$ 5.6 billion, with production expected to start in the third quarter of 2022 ('A') and 2024 ('E') respectively - adding 760 million MMSCFD and 35,000 barrels of condensate per day to Libya's production.

The completion of the Wafa Inlet Gas Compression (WIGC) project was also welcomed by parties - a significant onshore achievement providing increased gas supply to the domestic market, the NOC reported.

Cooperation between Eni and the General Electricity Company of Libya (GECOL) to increase electricity generation through the deployment of typical power generation and renewable energy projects was also reviewed, the report added.

According to the NOC's chairman: ""The completion of Phase 2 is a testament to NOC's ongoing partnership with key international players and our ability to drive international investment to the Libyan energy sector, despite an ongoing backdrop of conflict.

The top management of GECOL admitted that there has been a problem with meeting power supply for years.

It admitted that it does not currently have the generation capacity to meet peak winter and summer demand. It confirmed that generation is at 5,000 MW with demand at 7,000 MW.

It proposed that if consumers reduced consumption by a third, there would be no power cuts within an hour.

It said that this could potentially make the oil terminal a military target. It warned that these actions could result in the withdrawal of NOC personnel from the port for their safety.

The NOC reported that a group of around 80 military personnel under the command of Major General Abdullah Nur al-Din al-Hamali entered the port on Wednesday, 5 June.

The NOC went on to say that the military personnel had taken over a building within the terminal and are converting it for military use. In addition, the forces have attempted to fuel a warship, appropriated meals designated for staff, and seized 31 dormitories allocated to Harouge Oil Operations (HOO) employees, which is the NOC subsidiary operating the port.

""NOC works on behalf of all Libyans. We cannot accept a situation where any party to the current conflict misuses oil facilities,"" NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla was quoted as saying with regards to the incident.

""The presence of forces inside the terminal represents an unacceptable risk to employees. This renders the terminal a potential military target, thereby risking the destruction of Libyan oil infrastructure - and the resulting economic crisis that would follow,"" he had added.

The NOC said that it will not compromise on the safety of staff. If risk assessment indicates that continued operations present an unacceptable risk to workers, it will take steps necessary to protect them - including their withdrawal from the terminal.

In concluding the statement, the NOC reiterated its neutrality, non-partisanship and detachment from the ongoing Tripoli conflict.

On the other hand, the Chairman of the House of Representatives (HoR) Energy and Natural Resources Committee of Issa Al-Araibi, declared his rejection and condemnation of the statements made by Mustafa Sanalla regarding the LNA's control over the oil fields and the oilfields.

Al-Araibi added that after the LNA took control of the oil fields, the Libya's production rates increased and all the facilities provided by the LNA were safe and secure and the work was progressing excellently, which led to increased Libyan oil exports.

It will be recalled that it was the Khalifa Hafter-led LNA that twice liberated Libya's eastern oil fields from militia leader Ibrahim Jadran (Jadhran) and handed them over to the Tripoli-based NOC.

Mr. President [Ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani of Indonesia],

Let me start by wishing ""Ramadan Karim"" to our Muslim colleagues on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan.

Allow me to congratulate the Republic of Indonesia for its Presidency of the Security Council this month. I am grateful for this opportunity to brief you in person on our work in Libya.

Mr. President,

This is the report whose delivery I have spent the nearly last two years trying to avoid. Forty-eight days into the attack on Tripoli by General Haftar's forces, there has already been too much death and destruction. Libya is on the verge of descending into a civil war which could lead to the permanent division of the country. The damage already done will take years to mend, and that's only if the war is ended now.

The consequences and the risks of the conflict are already painfully clear, especially for the Libyan people: over 460 dead, 29 of them civilians. Over 2400 injured, the majority of them civilians. Over 75,000 people forced from their homes, all of them civilians. Over half of the displaced are women and children. Humanitarian actors estimate that over 100,000 men, women and children remain trapped in immediate frontline areas, with over 400,000 more in areas directly impacted by the clashes.

While the conditions for migrants and refugees in Libya were already dire prior to the conflict, these conditions have now gone from bad to worse. Nearly 3,400 refugees and migrants are trapped in detention centres exposed to, or in close proximity to, the fighting. The UN humanitarian agencies have been working around the clock to transfer the most vulnerable from the conflict-affected areas to safer locations, and I am very proud of their work.

Mr. President,

When the Secretary-General visited Libya on 3 April, his visit was intended to show the full support of the international community to the peaceful resolution of Libya's long period of upheaval.

The capital was enjoying a measure of increased security, the population a much more stable currency and an improved economic outlook, and the political process, despite many obstacles, was moving forward.

Indeed, we were on the eve of hosting the National Conference in the Libyan city of Ghadames. An event that would have brought together over 150 Libyans from across the country. There was great public excitement about what the conference could yield in terms of a way forward to end Libya's eight-year long period of transition and usher in a new period of stability and security through the ballot box. To see those who had enthusiastically accepted our invitation to Ghadames suddenly take up arms against each other to attack the capital, or to defend it, has thrown me into the deepest level of sadness for the opportunity lost and for a hope killed exactly ten days before its realization.

The attack on Tripoli also imperilled the potential of the talks which had been held on 27 February in Abu Dhabi between Prime Minister Serraj and General Haftar, the sixth of its kind between them. At those talks there had been the real opportunity to replace the Government of National Accord in Tripoli, dissolve the parallel government in Beida and create an inclusive, unified national government, which would have shepherded the country through the election process to the end of the Transitional Period. The understandings reached in Abu Dhabi had also placed the military under civilian control, a key demand of the vast majority of Libyans and many in the international community.

Mr. President,

I am no Cassandra, but the violence on the outskirts of Tripoli is just the start of a long and bloody war on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, imperilling the security of Libya's immediate neighbors and the wider Mediterranean region. The security vacuum created by the withdrawal of many of General Haftar's troops from the south, coupled with the focus of the western forces on the defense of the capital, is already being exploited by Da'esh and Al-Qaeda. In the South of Libya, the black flags of Da'esh are appearing and I am dismayed to report that since April 4, there have been four separate Da'esh attacks in the south of Libya: two attacks in Ghodwa, one in Sebha and one just a few days ago in Zella. The cumulative toll of the attacks has been: 17 killed, more than 10 wounded, and 8 kidnapped. Libyan forces that had in the past courageously defended their country against these terrorist groups are now busy fighting each other. In addition to the innocent Libyans being ruthlessly subjected to the increasing terror of Da'esh, there will be spillover of this violence to Libya's immediate neighbors.

There are numerous reports of extremists, persons under international sanctions, and individuals wanted by the International Criminal Court appearing on the battlefield on all sides. All parties must publicly disassociate themselves from such elements without delay and refer to the ICC those for whom arrest warrants have been issued. I recommend that the Council support the formation of a Commission of Inquiry to determine who has taken up arms and support the establishment of mechanisms to ensure the exclusion of unwanted elements.

No less worrying is the fact that arms are pouring in again to all sides. The blatant and televised breach of the arms embargo by the apparent delivery of a large quantity of weapons and armored vehicles to GNA forces in Tripoli a few days ago comes on the heels of earlier and ongoing deliveries of banned modern weaponry to the LNA. Many countries are providing weapons to all parties in the conflict without exception. The amount and sophistication of these weapons are already causing greater numbers of casualties. Without a robust enforcement mechanism, the arms embargo into Libya will become a cynical joke. Some nations are fueling this bloody conflict; the United Nations should put an end to it.

The conflict has been characterized by the use of airstrikes, heavy artillery and the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas. Ramadan nights, normally convivially spent in the company of one's neighbors and family, have become periods of sheer terror for the residents of the capital, waiting in fear for the next attack. Since mid-April there has been a rising number of night-time precision strikes on GNA positions in and around Tripoli by unknown aircraft, averaging five a night. On May 8 an ammunition depot belonging to the GNA-aligned Janzour Knights was hit in an airstrike that was within a kilometre of the UN compound where we work and live.

Mr. President,

The large number of casualties has overburdened already weakened health facilities struggling with shortages of medical personnel and supplies. Eleven ambulances were directly hit by airstrikes, rockets and shelling while on duty. I am appalled by the apparent disregard for the due protection of personnel engaging in vital medical tasks and recall that attacks against health workers constitute a serious violation of International Humanitarian Law.

We are also deeply concerned by the sharp increase in abductions, disappearances and arbitrary arrests since the start of the current conflict. At least seven officials and employees were arbitrarily detained or kidnapped in East and West Libya. The fate of all these individuals remains unknown, and there may be others who have disappeared under similar circumstances. Journalists also face increasing threats, intimidation and violence, often in connection with reporting on the conflict.

I therefore call for your unequivocal support in insisting on the application of International Humanitarian Law with all parties to the conflict. We need to demonstrate to those who commit violations that impunity will not prevail. We need to sanction those who use the fog of war to settle violently personal or political scores.

As the conflict rolls on, Libya's social fabric is unraveling at an alarming rate. Calls for a halt to the fighting and reconciliation amongst the warring parties are being drowned out by internal and regional parties who have weaponised social media to drive fake news, false narratives, and expressions of hatred that more deeply divide the population. The Mission has established a mechanism to monitor hate speech on-line and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has already referred a number of cases of incitement to Facebook.

Mr. President,

The UN maintains an active presence on the ground in Libya, in Tripoli and through our hub in Benghazi. We have naturally scaled down our non-essential personnel given the situation but we remain in Libya, alongside the Libyan people to deliver as best we can. Over 42,000 people have received some kind of assistance through UN programs since the start of the conflict.

Prices of food are rising across the country as shortages start to occur. Insecurity and resource demands of the parties to the conflict are exacerbating these shortages, particularly in regards to fuel.

Another casualty of the conflict is Libya's infrastructure, including electricity and water. Already unable to meet demand, the water supply to the capital and the whole of north-west Libya has been weaponised as armed groups have cut off the Man Made River to extract concessions. This act put tens of thousands of people in immediate danger and may constitute a war crime. Such acts must be condemned in the strongest terms.

The only positive economic indicator is that all parties have so far acted in the national interest by not impeding the oil supply.

However, there are indications that the eastern branch of the National Oil Company is again attempting to export oil in violation of the sanctions' regime. This illegal attempt risks dividing the National Oil Company, which remains the primary source of revenue for the country, and the national social safety net.

Mr. President,

Don't discount Libyan resilience in the face of this tragic turn of events. Since 30 March, Libyan citizens have shown admirable resolve in democratically electing new municipal councils in 22 municipalities in the western and southern parts of Libya. Eighteen of these councils have already sworn-in their mayors. It is unfortunate that some elections had to be postponed for security reasons. In that regard, I note that efforts by the parallel government in the East to appoint Mayors or block municipal elections from being held are a denial of the rights of all Libyans to elect their local representatives. It is vital to keep the pilot light of democracy alive in Libya, and I appeal to the Council to lend its unqualified support to the continuation of the municipal election process.

Mr. President,

There is no military solution to Libya. This is not a cliché, it is a fact, and it is high time for those who have harboured this illusion to open their eyes and adjust themselves to this reality. Libya's mosaic of communities cannot be governed without alliances and relationships stretching across the country. It was to be through the National Conference bringing these myriad communities together that hope for an inclusive, peaceful and prosperous future existed.

I hear many Libyans telling us that the political process cannot ignore the present war as if it did not take place. They are right; there is a before and after April 4 and we, as impartial mediators, need to adjust that process in order to bridge the deep gap of mistrust that has prevailed since that date. Our consultations with the parties, as well as with men and women of influence, have not ceased and we struggle to maintain a minimum of political fluidity among the various groups who, sooner rather than later, will need to come back and devise together a better future for their children, and a more peaceful formula for power and resources sharing. For that, Libyans need for the international community, instead of being the amplifying mirror for their divisions, to work in unison to mitigate and alleviate these divisions.

A better future is still possible, but we all must be seized with the fierce urgency of now while the front lines remain on the outskirts of Tripoli and before the battle moves, God forbid, to the capital's more densely populated neighborhoods. This will require concerted and immediate action by the international community.

Without the international and regional stakeholders recognizing that Libya is not a prize for the strongest but a country of 6.5 million people who deserve peace and the right to collectively determine their own path forward, the future of Libya will be bleak. I fear that without immediate action to stop the flow of arms and pressure on Libyan parties to the conflict to enable a return to serious dialogue, Libya will descend into civil war which could potentially lead to a Hobbesian all-against-all state of chaos or partition of the country.

Sanalla underlined the risk protracted conflict poses to Libya's US$ 60 billion procurement opportunity for US oilfield service companies at the US MENA Country Dialogue Series, hosted on the sidelines of the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston.

Delivering a keynote address at the forum hosted by the Bilateral US-Arab Chamber of Commerce, Sanalla highlighted the opportunity for US companies in delivering cutting-edge technology, equipment and services to advance Libya's production ambition of 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) from existing fields by the end of 2019, and 2.1 million bpd by 2023.

""To deliver on NOC's five-year strategy, the corporation is executing a total of 56 major projects, including the drilling of 38 test wells and 70 development wells. The corporation wants to invest in the development of existing fields, gas utilization, and rehabilitate shut-in wells. We can't do this alone and are looking for expertise from US suppliers, vendors, and service companies,"" said Sanalla.

11398594,2019-05-09,"In her statement yesterday to the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Libya (pursuant to UNSCR 1970 (2011), International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said that she continues to make Libya a priority and to take the Libyan situation seriously.

She said that Saif Al-Islam Qaddafi, as well as other Libyans, were still wanted by the ICC and called upon the Libyan state as well as other states to cooperate with her.

1. I welcome the opportunity to engage with this Council once again as I present my seventeenth report on the situation in Libya. Before I do so, allow me to congratulate Indonesia on assuming the presidency of this Council for the month of May, and to thank you for chairing this session.

2. As I address you today, to my great regret, the fighting in Libya continues unabated. Over the past six months, violence has escalated and armed clashes have occurred in several areas of Libya, including Derna in the east, Murzuq in the south, and Tripoli in the west. As always, my Office continues to closely monitor the ongoing conflict, gathering information from diverse sources and assessing whether crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court may have been committed.

3. My Office is of course paying close attention to the ongoing armed conflict in and around Tripoli since early April this year. Reports indicate that the fighting has already cost 432 lives, including at least 23 civilians. More than 50,000 people have reportedly been internally displaced by the hostilities, while others remain trapped in conflict-affected areas. In addition, there are serious concerns for the safety of migrants and refugees who are detained in centres near areas of conflict.

4. On the 16th of April, I issued a statement calling on all parties to the armed conflict to fully respect the rules of international humanitarian law. I emphasised that all parties to the armed conflict must take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and detention centres.

5. In particular, I urged commanders, whether military or civilian, to ensure that their subordinates do not commit Rome Statute crimes. The law on this is clear. Where a commander knew, or should have known, that their subordinates were committing or about to commit crimes, and failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to prevent or repress such crimes, the commander may be held criminally responsible.

6. I benefit from my intervention in this forum to once again make my message to all those involved in the fighting in Libya clear: my Office stands ready to investigate and, where appropriate, to prosecute any persons party to the ongoing armed conflict should they engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC. The suffering of the Libyan people must stop.

7. I urge this Council and all member states of the United Nations to ensure a consistent and unambiguous message is conveyed to all warring factions in Libya that the rules of international humanitarian law must be fully respected, and that perpetrators of atrocity crimes will be held individually criminally responsible.

Mr President, Your Excellencies,

8. I would now like to update the Council in relation to the case of Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi. As you are aware, in June last year, Mr Gaddafi filed a challenge to the admissibility of his case before the ICC. Mr Gaddafi submitted that his case was inadmissible because he had already been tried in Libya for the same conduct as alleged before the ICC.

9. Mr Gaddafi has lost this challenge. On the 5th of April this year, the majority of Pre-Trial Chamber I judges rejected his admissibility challenge, deciding that Mr Gaddafi's case remains admissible before the ICC. Earlier today, a separate concurring opinion was issued by Judge Perrin de Brichambaut of the same Chamber where he concurred with the majority decision on three main points: first, that Mr Gaddafi has standing to lodge the admissibility challenge; second, rejecting the admissibility challenge, and third that the case against Mr Gaddafi is admissible.

10. In reaching its decision, the Chamber found that Mr Gaddafi had not been tried in Libya within the meaning of the relevant articles of the Rome Statute. According to Libyan national law, since Mr Gaddafi was convicted by the Tripoli Court of Assize in absentia, once he is arrested, his trial should start anew. Thus, no final judgment on the merits had been issued in the domestic proceedings against Mr Gaddafi. In addition, the judgment passed against Mr Gaddafi had not acquired a res judicata effect, which the Chamber found was required to satisfy the applicable articles of the Rome Statute.

11. Furthermore, the Chamber found that Mr Gaddafi had not received an amnesty in Libya. The Chamber observed that ""granting amnesties and pardons for serious acts such as murder constituting crimes against humanity is incompatible with internationally recognized human rights."" It stated that ""[a]mnesties and pardons intervene with States' positive obligations to investigate, prosecute and punish perpetrators of core crimes"" and ""deny victims the right to truth, access to justice, and to request reparations where appropriate.""

12. These are important findings in relation to the fight against impunity for international crimes, and ones that align with previous findings concerning amnesties and pardons by several regional and international courts and tribunals around the world.

13. Mr Gaddafi has filed an appeal against the Chamber's decision on the admissibility challenge.

Mr President, Your Excellencies,

14. Irrespective of the current admissibility proceedings, Libya remains under an obligation to arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi to the ICC. Unfortunately, Mr Gaddafi's case is not the only one in the Libya situation that remains at an impasse. Arrest warrants are also outstanding in relation to all other suspects in the Libya situation with respect to Messrs Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled and Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf Al-Werfalli.

15. Ultimately, the execution of these arrest warrants depends on the cooperation of States. Regrettably, securing State cooperation in the arrest and surrender of suspects remains one of the greatest challenges faced by the ICC. The Court's performance cannot be divorced from this reality. The Court's success largely depends on the effective and concrete cooperation of states.

16. Failure to arrest and surrender persons against whom warrants of arrest have been issued can result in real harm. This is starkly illustrated by the case of Mr Al-Werfalli. Despite the ICC warrant of arrest against him for the war crime of murder in relation to 33 people, Mr Al-Werfalli remains at liberty and allegedly murdered another 10 victims just five months after the ICC arrest warrant was issued. Today, two warrants for his arrest remain outstanding. The fact that Mr Al-Werfalli is in Libya is well-known. He is not detained and there is no evidence that he has been genuinely prosecuted in Libya by his superiors in the Libyan National Army.

17. Mr Al-Tuhamy, former head of the Libyan Internal Security Agency, who is accused of crimes relating to the unlawful imprisonment, persecution and torture of perceived political opponents of the Muammar Gaddafi regime, has been wanted since 2013.

18. Notwithstanding the grave crimes alleged against them, all three suspects in the Libya situation remain at large. The failure to arrest these suspects jeopardises the Office's ongoing investigations. It sends a message to victims that alleged perpetrators can evade justice and continue to commit crimes with impunity. It deters witnesses from coming forward and putting their confidence in the ICC, and places them in unnecessary danger. In the long run, this lack of accountability undermines respect for the rule of law and impedes progress towards stability and security in Libya.

19. The status quo is not sustainable. Impunity for atrocity crimes is hardly conducive to bringing peace and stability to this war-torn country. I take this opportunity to renew my call for state cooperation with the arrest and transfer of ICC suspects, and ask this Council to lend its support by taking a clear and vocal position in support.

Mr President, Your Excellencies,

20. My Office also continues to follow the situation relating to internally displaced persons in Libya. Tens of thousands of persons reportedly remain internally displaced. Internally displaced persons, especially women and children, are among the most vulnerable populations. They suffer not only significant social and economic impacts, but are also exposed to acts of violence.

21. Migrants also represent a highly vulnerable population in Libya. Reports of serious and widespread crimes being committed against migrants have not diminished over the past six month period. My team continues to gather evidence in relation to these alleged crimes through both investigative and cooperation strategies. In doing so, we pay particular attention to the commission of sexual and gender-based crimes.

22. The body of evidence collected by my Office indicates that crimes including torture, unlawful imprisonment, rape and enslavement are committed against migrants throughout their journeys and in both official and unofficial detention centres. The evidence implicates individuals, militias and State actors in the migrant smuggling and trafficking business in many parts of Libya, including Misrata, Al-Zawiyah, Tripoli and Bani Walid.

23. On the basis of the evidence collected to date, my team continues to assess the feasibility of bringing cases before the ICC in relation to crimes against migrants. At the same time, my Office is cooperating with a number of States and organisations to support national investigations and prosecutions that relate to human smuggling and trafficking through Libya. This strategy is aimed at closing the impunity gap by assisting national systems to provide accountability for crimes that may not fall within the ICC's jurisdiction. Feedback from our partners shows that this strategy is already proving effective and issuing in concrete results.

Mr President, Your Excellencies,

24. Before I conclude, I would like to express my appreciation for the cooperation my Office receives from many States, including Libya, Tunisia, The Netherlands, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We also receive valuable assistance from organisations such as the United Nations Support Mission in Libya and INTERPOL. The practical support of these States and organisations for the work of the ICC deserves recognition.

25. I would also like to acknowledge the courage of many Libyans who have cooperated with my Office since 2011 until the present day. My team has spoken to people who have endured unspeakable suffering and lost loved ones in terrible circumstances. We are aware that, given the prevailing climate of impunity in Libya, there are people who see the ICC as their only hope to hold alleged perpetrators of atrocity crimes to account. We also know that many people, understandably, would like to see more results from the ICC, sooner rather than later.

26. The types of investigations undertaken by my Office are complex and often lengthy. However, I assure you, and the Libyan people, that the Libya situation remains a priority for my Office. My team takes most seriously its responsibility to investigate and prosecute ICC crimes in Libya, and is working hard to advance its existing cases and also to bring new ones.

27. Ultimately, my Office's progress in the Libya situation is frustrated, and confidence in the ICC is undermined when, year after year, warrants of arrest remain unexecuted. The credibility of this Council is also tarnished if it fails to take concrete measures to secure the arrest and surrender of suspects. When suspects are arrested and surrendered to the ICC, the allegations against them can be tested in a fair and public hearing. This gives the victims of their alleged crimes the opportunity to participate in the proceedings, to be heard, and to see justice done.

28. Therefore, it is imperative that all of the outstanding warrants of arrest in the Libya situation are executed. The achievement of this goal requires the full cooperation of members of this Council and all concerned States. This includes both States Parties and non-States Parties, including Libya itself. Together, we can ensure the effective implementation of Resolution 1970 and adequately respond to the hopes and expectations it generated for the Libyan people. The peace and stability that the Libyan people have desired for so long are closely intertwined with the ICC's ability to effectively execute its mandate in the Libya situation.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Indonesia', 'Derna, Libya', 'Bani Walid', 'Misrata', 'Tunisia', 'Netherlands', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom']","ICC takes Libya seriously, calls for implementation of arrest warrants",https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/05/09/icc-takes-libya-seriously-calls-for-implementation-of-arrest-warrants/,None,
11398595,2019-03-21,"During his latest brief on Libya to the UN Security Council made via a video link from Tripoli yesterday, UNSMIL head Ghassan Salame said Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) forces were generally perceived as a positive and stabilizing development in the south, but asked if the operation was sustainable.

However, he criticised its mobilization further north which he said caused friction and counter-mobilizations which could lead inadvertently to conflict. He expressed concern about human rights violations in Derna.

He confirmed that Hafter and Serraj had ''met'' in Abu Dhabi and confirmed Serraj's version of their agreement that Libya will be a democratic state and its army would be under civilian control.

Salame praised the Serraj government economic reforms but stressed that there needs to be more to save the Libyan economy and stressed the need for the forthcoming National Conference (Multaqa) to help Libya exit its transitional state and avoid force becoming the decisive factor in resolving its conflict.

Here is his full brief:

I would have wished to be in New York and have the opportunity to brief you in person. However, it is no exaggeration to say that the situation in Libya has reached a crucial juncture. We are working to prevent recent developments and tensions on the ground from escalating, and instead to pivot to stability and a political compact which will enable an end to the crisis in the country.

On 13 January, the forces of General Haftar peacefully entered Sabha. Whilst there were some minor incidents, the arrival of Haftar's forces was generally perceived as a positive and stabilizing development.

When these forces moved to take control of Murzuq in the South West, there was active opposition from the Tebu community and affiliated armed groups. In the fighting, and in revenge attacks in the immediate aftermath, at least 18 residents of Murzuq were killed and a further 29 injured. Ninety homes were reported burned in revenge attacks by tribal forces under the LNA command.

Whilst the LNA has brought a large measure of security and stability to the South which enabled the parallel bank in the east to deliver bank notes to Sabha, it is unclear how long the campaign can be sustained given the long resupply lines and the limited financial resources of the parallel government.

There has been some mobilization of LNA forces in Jufra as well as the conducting of patrols towards Sirte. This has led to friction and a rise in tensions with forces from the town of Misrata who remain positioned in Sirte after their anti-ISIS operations there.

In the East, the fighting in Derna came to an end. I am deeply concerned by reports of human rights and humanitarian law violations during the recent military operations in Derna. The fighting reportedly resulted in many civilian casualties.

In the West of the country, local forces have mobilized in response to the current tensions. So far, such local mobilizations appear to be shows of force and no party appears imminently ready to launch an attack against any other. But there is a real risk of miscalculation or of extremist forces starting skirmishes in the hope of drawing others into a larger confrontation.

The Tripoli ceasefire continues to hold, but the Greater Tripoli Security Arrangements Plan remains only partially implemented.

UNSMIL has supported two rounds of preparatory talks between the advisors of Prime Minister Serraj and General Haftar which took place in our Tunis offices. As a result of those talks, the two leaders met in Abu Dhabi and agreed to a number of important principles: Libya shall be a civilian and democratically governed state that enjoys full civilian control of the military, and a peaceful transition of power. The parties also agreed on the need to unify Libya's long-divided institutions and for the scheduling of national elections before the end of the year.

Many of these principles are not new. Indeed, these talks are the continuation of the process which started in September 2017. What is new is the sincerity to turn these words into the end of the transitional period through elections.

Let me now brief you on other developments and activities on the ground. I am pleased to announce that the UN Hub in Benghazi is open. After many months of being almost open, UN staff are being deployed to Benghazi to better deliver across the East of the country.

Discussion is now underway concerning a further hub in Sabha to support operations in the South of the country and UN programs have also now visited Sabha for the first time since operations were halted there in 2013.

In my previous briefings I warned against the consequences of the economy of predation. I am encouraged by action taken to combat illegal smuggling. On 7 February the public prosecution issued over 100 arrest warrants against individuals, accused of involvement in smuggling and illegal disposal of fuel and ordered the confiscation of 115 fuel stations. This organized fuel smuggling amounts to more than USD 750 million annually.

Overall, Libya's infrastructure continues to deteriorate at an alarming rate. Basic services, including in health, water and electricity, are eroding. The situation of water production is particularly fragile. With nearly four wells being disabled every month, the western branch of the Man-Made River, which is the primary supplier of water to the north-west, is in imminent danger of collapse.

The 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan for Libya has been launched on 5 February, seeking USD 200 million to continue providing health, protection, water, and shelter to more than half a million of the most vulnerable people in Libya. An estimated 823,000 people, including migrants and 248,000 children, need humanitarian assistance in Libya.

The situation of the economy is mixed. The re-opening of the Sharara oil field, for which the UN played a crucial role, resulted in increased oil production that is returning to 1.2 million barrels per day. The foreign currency exchange fee, in combination with the liberalization of the opportunity to purchase foreign currency, continues to generate revenue, and strengthen the Dinar. This has increased purchasing power and reduced inflation and the profitability of the black market for currency.

While important, these benefits may be short-lived without genuine economic reforms. Such reforms require a direct devaluation of the currency and the lifting of subsidies which consume nearly 10% of the national budget. Working with the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya, the national audit review process will soon begin.

It is extremely positive that the Central Committee responsible for municipal council elections is starting with a new round of nine elections in the Southern and Western parts of Libya on 30 March. In this context, it is essential that there is only one body managing municipal elections.

The High National Electoral Commission is preparing for national elections. We are pleased to see that the HNEC, with the help of the UN and international partners, has finally now moved into its secure new headquarters.

It is now necessary for the government to provide the necessary operational funding for HNEC to finalise preparations for elections.

The Mission has been in steady contact with a number of countries and regional organisations, including the League of Arab States, the African Union, and the European Union. I joined the Secretary General at the African Union Summit and welcome the AU's interest in supporting the UN Action Plan. I am grateful for the support expressed for our efforts during the visit of Commissioner Chergui and USG DiCarlo on 12-13 March.

The National Conference will be held from 14 to 16 April inside Libya. It represents a critical opportunity to end the transitional period, which began eight years ago.

Ahead of the National Conference, we are working with many parties to ensure as broad a buy-in as possible to the political process. What is clear is that the Libyan people fervently desire that their institutions be united as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they are up against powerful forces, which have materially profited from the country's chaos and division and are therefore loath to work towards a unification.

There is much at stake. If the opportunity presented by the National Conference is not seized, then we will be faced with only two possible options: prolonged stalemate or conflict. This stalemate may also ultimately lead to conflict.

Or conflict may erupt much sooner. A failure now to advance the political process demonstrates absolutely that the country is totally controlled by force of arms. But today, we have the ability to step back from the edge of this precipice.

The National Conference offers a crucial opportunity for all parties, with no exclusion, to put aside their differences for the good of the country, to unite, to avoid war and to choose a path of peace and prosperity.

The National Conference will choose whether to endorse the National Charter which was the product of the National Conference consultative process.

It will also chart a roadmap to conclude the transitional period: through simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections, or through phased elections. It will provide recommendations on how to deal with the Draft Constitution produced by the Constitutional Drafting Assembly.

The days ahead will prove foundational to the years ahead for Libyans and the region writ large. I call on Libyans to come together and to avoid acts of obstruction and incitement. There has been a notable uptick in the weaponization of media platforms as tools of incitement. This is tearing at Libya's fragile but vital social fabric and could well be used to instigate violence. At this sensitive time, I call on all actors to refrain from the use of inflammatory and alienating rhetoric in the public sphere.

I also call on all in the international community to put the interests of the Libyan people first, and to act committedly and sincerely to pressure all parties to avoid conflict and conclude a peaceful formula to end the transitional period in Libya, for the sake of all of the Libyan people.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Derna, Libya', 'Libya', 'Murzuq District', 'Sirte', 'Abu Dhabi', 'New York City', 'Tunis', 'Jufra District', 'Misrata', 'Benghazi']","Salame's latest brief to UN Security Council: Qualified praise for Hafter, warned against mobilization, concerned about Derna, confirmed Abu Dhabi outcomes, need more economic reforms and stressed need for National Conference",https://www.libyaherald.com/2019/03/21/salames-latest-brief-to-un-security-council-qualified-praise-for-hafter-warned-against-mobilization-concerned-about-derna-confirmed-abu-dhabi-outcomes-need-more-economic-reforms-and-stre/,None,

''Russia is conducting exclusively responsible politics in Libya. It is devoid of a geopolitical dimension and puts Libyan interests at the forefront. We are not siding with anyone in this conflict. Our approaches to resolving crises - be it in the Middle East or other regions of the world - invariably rely on the principle of an all-encompassing national dialogue aimed at finding trade-offs based on international law and corresponding UN Security Council resolutions.

We have more than once confirmed this position in public, including during international conferences on Libya. Our goal is to help the Libyans overcome the chaos into which their country was plunged eight years ago as a result of NATO's illegitimate intervention, and to restore peace and security that are essential for sustainable development throughout its territory. I think this is how the future of Libya is seen not only by us, but the entire international community as well.

11398632,2019-10-18,"Authorities in eastern Libya seek to ease administrative procedures for the public by creating a unified electronic portal (Logo: Benghazi Municipality).

Several state sectors and institutions in eastern Libya agreed to establish a unified electronic window to ease the conduct of various administrative procedures, Benghazi Municipality reported.

The meeting on Wednesday was held between representatives of Benghazi Municipality, Benghazi Chamber of Commerce, the eastern office of the Ministry of Economy and the Labour Office.

The meeting discussed how to facilitate administrative services in the eastern region through the integration of the different systems in some entities into one in order to provide unified administrative services to citizens through a one stop system, for a better, faster and more simplified service from a unified point. They also agreed to unify the paper forms that citizens would have to fill-in.

To this end, the attendees agreed on the need to nominate a representative for each sector and issue a stamp dedicated to its sector and to allocate a one stop dedicated headquarters for the presence of delegates to perform their tasks. The one stop would save time and energy to members of the public, saving them the inconvenience of shuttling from one state entity location to another.

The concept of a ''unified window'' is not a new one to Libya as it had been first established by the then reforming Saif Al-Islam Qaddafi to speed up company formations prior to the 2011 revolution. Nor has the idea of increased use of electronic portals to deliver government services. However, successive governments since the Qaddafi regime have failed to implement this vision.

Reviewing the current Libyan economic and business situation, Bey pointed out that since October 2018 people's sentiment has improved and the purchasing power of the Libyan dinar (LD) is on positive ground and ''doubled in five months''.

Bey's opinion counts as he owns or holds shareholdings in a string of leading international brands, retail stores and in logistics . He is in daily touch with the pulse of Libya's business environment.

Bey pulled no punches on his views of how the current Faiez Serraj government, the Central Bank of Libya (CBL - West and East) and the Tripoli Audit Bureau have handled Libya's economic crisis. ''The dinar purchasing power, after its recent gains, has the potential to double again in no time - if the corrective measures are taken and decreed by Mr Serraj'', he added.

''The inflation rate has also moved into negative grounds as reported by the CBL (-1.9 percent) for the last quarter of 2018 and is expected to shrink further in the first quarter of 2019 after having been a galloping inflation for four consecutive years accumulating to over 600% since 2012''.

The economic sentiment today is high, jump started by the introduction of a 183 percent foreign exchange Surcharge. Bey explained that this is ''very high since the introduction of the foreign exchange surcharge in October 2018''and must be built upon with further moves . He said that this ''marked a turning point since the low point, gloom and self-inflicted economic destruction of 2014''.

While commending the recent reform package passed by the Serraj administration and the CBL in September 2018, Bey is adamant that ''Much more can be achieved with little or minimal risk !''

11398686,2019-04-25,"After three weeks, armed conflict continues across multiple areas, including Khallat Al Furjan and Ain Zara, south west and south of Tripoli, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says in its latest report.

This comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the latest death toll reached 264 and the wounded count reached 1,266 as a result of the fighting. WHO called for the temporary cessation of fighting and the respect of international human rights.

The Faiez Serraj government official spokesperson, Muhanad Younis, said yesterday that the states that are supporting the ''criminal Hafter'' aim to return dictatorships and do not want freedom for people. He did not mention them by name, but the accepted popular wisdom in Libya is Egypt, UAE and Saudi Arabia.

On the battlefield, the official Spokesperson for the Serraj Ministry of Interior claimed that the areas from Wadi Rabea to Aziziya, south west and south of Tripoli, were all ''liberated'' from Hafter forces. He said that Hafter and his forces want to destabilize Tripoli and show that the Serraj government is incapable of securing the capital.

The Libyan National Army (LNA) official Spokesperson, Ahmed Mesmari, meanwhile, claimed that new troops from Zintan were joining the battlefront. There are also unconfirmed reports of other LNA-aligned troops from the south joining the fighting.

Whilst the sandstorm meant that there were no air raids reported yesterday, today, Mesmari claimed that the LNA defences repelled an air raid by pro-GNA fighter jets on the Jufra (central Libya) airbase, downing one and forcing the other two to flee. The Serraj government denied it had lost a jet fighter.

Meanwhile, Tripoli's only functioning passenger airport, Mitiga, announced that it was now operating normal hours after having had restricted flying ours from 5pm to 8am.

On the humanitarian front, the OCHA report says that a marked increase in precision airstrikes has been reported over the past few days in Abu Sleem, Wadi al-Rabia, Swani, Ain Zara and in the vicinity of Tripoli International Airport.

OCHA says that as a direct result of armed conflict, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. On the ground, frontlines have largely remained static and the number of ground engagements and intensity of rocket/mortar attacks has reduced from previous days. At least 89 civilian casualties, including 20 fatalities, have been verified since the beginning of the conflict, with no new casualty figures verified in the past 48 hours. It adds that verified casualty numbers always represent the absolute minimum, and that unconfirmed numbers could well be higher. These casualties include medical personnel, women and children, and at least one refugee/migrant.

The report says about 34,100 people have been forced to flee their homes, while an unconfirmed number of civilians remain trapped in conflict-affected areas. Trapped civilians are either unable to flee due to conflict dynamics or unwilling to leave due to fear of looting of their premises due to perceived political affiliation. This includes nearly 3,600 refugees and migrants who are located in Detention Centres in conflict-affected areas or areas in close proximity to clashes.

Refugees and migrants in urban settings report face discrimination with regards to their access to collective shelters, with reports of them being routinely requested to provide health certificates as a pretext for denying them access to collective shelters. In response, a dedicated collective shelter under the supervision of the Libyan Red Cross has been set up in a school building in downtown Tripoli to receive exclusively refugees and migrants.

Humanitarian partners continue to advocate for the rights of refugees and migrants regarding their safe and unimpeded access to shelter space and access other life-saving assistance.

Nearly 3,600 refugees and migrants remain trapped in detention centres (DCs) that are in conflict-affected areas or in areas at risk of armed conflict. Beyond the threat posed by ongoing fighting, refugees and migrants in some DCs face dire living conditions, with the lack of food being of particular concern. A solution to the breakdown in food provision at DCs has yet to be found, since the companies contracted by local authorities to provide food to the affected DCs have ceased deliveries due to the security situation, the report said.

In some DCs the water sanitation and hygiene situation is extremely poor and some have been without drinking water for several days. Further reports were received that armed forces are currently located inside the Gharian DC, increasing the protection concerns faced by the civilians detained there. Ambulances are reportedly refusing to attend to medical cases in some DCs, the report says.

Medical facilities and personnel continue to be subject to indiscriminate shelling, the OCHA report says. To date three health workers (two doctors and one ambulance driver) have been killed and one doctor injured. These incidents further hamper the ability of already overstretched health services to provide vital assistance to civilians, including those inured as a result of armed conflict, the report adds.

The report says that 34,100 displaced individuals have been identified since the onset of the crisis, including an increase of nearly 1,800 IDPs whose displacement has been recorded within the last 48 hours. The majority of IDPs are staying with family or in private accommodations, while over 2,200 IDPs are currently sheltered in 16 collective centres set up by local authorities.

11398687,2019-03-11,"The Libyan Business Council (LBC) and Italy's ambassador to Tripoli, Giuseppe Buccino Grimaldi, discussed a number of private sector trade and investment topics during their meeting on Sunday.

The meeting held at the LBC's headquarters in Tripoli included several members of the LBC from other Libyan cities.

Speaking exclusively to Libya Herald after the meeting, LBC chairman, Abdalla Fellah, offered his ambitious vision for a huge Libyan-Italian linkage over and beyond the simple, traditional trade model.

He said that Libya and Italy had a natural affinity due to history, logistics and geography. He called for a synergy between the two neighbours and for Italy's business sector to use Libya as their cost-effective ''offshore'' base.

''Italy should exploit Libya's proximity, demand and virgin 2,000 km of coastline and beaches for trade, industry and tourism to expand its 'Made in Italy' brand and model'', he explained. He also felt that Libya with its high birth rate and over two thirds ""young"" population can offer a solution to Italy's low birth rate and aging population.

Beyond upskilling Libya's citizens to serve Italy's economy, Fellah saw a neat solution for the problem of illegal migration and terrorism. ''Italy can use Libya's vast coastline and size to create offshore business and industrial zones employing sub-Saharan Africans here too'', he explained.

Fellah said that Libya was not an industrial productive country and was likely to remain an importer of value-added finished goods for the short to medium term.

''Libya needs to import nearly everything - from A to Z - and Italy is a major industrial producer and exporter. There is a huge demand on one side - the Libyan side - and a huge capability to manufacture and export on the other side - the Italian side''.

''There is a natural complementarity between the two countries, with only a 'small' body of Mediterranean water in between us that can be traversed by sea or air in a very short period of time. It's a huge opportunity for both countries - to solve both their respective problems. It's a clear win-win scenario for both'', Fellah emphasized.

After decades of wasted development opportunity under the Qaddafi regime and the wasted years of political and military strife since the 2011 revolution Fellah is in no doubt that ''Libya needs billions worth of investment and offers billions worth of investment opportunities'' which Italy should exploit before others do.

The protocol was signed for the Egyptian side by Ahmed Abdulhamid, chairman of the Egyptian Raw Materials Manufacturing Association and for Libya by Hani Safrakis, president of the Libyan Egyptian Joint Economic Chamber in the presence of a number of other Libyan and Egyptian dignatories, including Mohammed Raied president of Libya's General Union of Chambers of Commerce.

The protocol hopes to integrate and create a complementarity between the Egyptian and Libyan private sectors in the reconstruction process of Libya.

Building on its historic, cultural and logistic ties, and its price competitive advantage, Egypt hopes to secure the lion's share of Libya's reconstruction raw materials and labour needs.

Egypt has a huge raw materials manufacturing sector and wants to position itself as a major regional player in MENA reconstruction efforts.

The protocol also aims to offer training and exchange of know-how and experience with Libyan companies.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mohamed Raied, president of Libya's General Union of Chambers of Commerce stressed the need for the normalisation of relations between the two countries by providing facilities to business leaders in both countries and facilitating the movement and entry of Egyptian labour into Libya.

He added that the Libyan market needs reconstruction and is a promising market in dire need of Egyptian industry and its products, especially building materials and supplies,

He complained about the fact that there were only two direct flights a week from Libya to Egypt, and only to Alexandria, compared to many more to Tunis and Istanbul.

The head of the Joint Libyan-Egyptian Economic Chamber, Hani Safrakis, said that the reconstruction cost of Libya is estimated by the Workd Bank at about US$ 100 billion, adding that the Libyan government's initial estimate of the number of workers Libya requires exceeds 3 million Egyptian workers.

He said that the Tripoli-based government had made allocations for development in both its 2018 and 2019 budgets.

These budgets represents a new opportunity and prospects for the Egyptian building materials and accessories sectors, he added.

Safrakis said that Libyan-Egyptian trade had decreased from US$ 1.5 bn in 2013 to US$ 0.5 bn in 2017.

He stressed the importance of re-evaluating Libyan security, taking into account economic benefits and common interests without security conditions so as not to harm common interests, especially Egyptian manufacturing.

He also called for the amendment of the trade agreement signed between Egypt and Libya in 1991 and and that it should be re-activated and reformulated to cope with the new trade realities and common interests.

Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) says it needs US$ 60 bn of investment in its oil and gas sector over the coming years.

The news was confirmed to Libya Herald by the NOC's media department today.

The clarification comes on the back of erroneous media reports that the NOC needs this amount in 2019. Libya's total state annual budget is barely half that amount.

The NOC said the US$ 60 bn investment would be divided into US$ 20 bn for upstream and US$ 40 bn in downstream investments.

Turkey will increase its military support to the internationally recognised government of Libya if necessary and will evaluate ground, air and marine options, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday, after the two signed a military cooperation accord last month, Reuters reports.

Turkey backs Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, which has been torn by factional conflict since 2011, and has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by UN experts seen by Reuters last month.

Turkey has also said it could deploy troops to Libya if the GNA makes such a request. The GNA has been fighting a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces based in the east of the country. Haftar's forces have received support from Russia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.

Speaking in the northern province of Kocaeli, Erdogan said Turkey had recently provided ""very serious"" support to the GNA, adding Libya was a country Turkey would support ""with its life"".

""They are supporting an illegal warlord, who is the pawn of certain nations, instead of the UN-recognised government,"" Erdogan said, in an apparent reference to Haftar and the countries which support him.

""If necessary, we will increase the military aspect of our support to Libya, and evaluate all our options, from the ground, air and sea,"" he said.

Speaking before Erdogan, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey will stand by Libya's government until peace, stability and security are established in the country.

Last month, Turkey and the GNA signed an accord to boost military cooperation and a separate deal on maritime boundaries, which has enraged Greece. Ankara and Athens have been at odds over hydrocarbon resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus.

While Greece has said the accord violates international law, Turkey has rejected those accusations, saying it aims to protect its rights in the eastern Mediterranean. On Sunday, Erdogan said Turkey will ""absolutely"" not turn back from its agreements with Libya.

""Nobody should come to us with attempts to exclude us, trap us in our own shores or steal our economic interests,"" Erdogan said. ""We have no intention of starting conflicts with anyone for no reason, or robbing anyone of their rights,"" he said.

""Those who oppose us have no sense of rights, law, justice, ethics or mercy,"" Erdogan said, referring to Greece, Israel and Egypt, who have opposed the maritime accord.

In an interview with Greek daily To Vima on Sunday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the accord with Libya was in line with international law, adding Ankara may consider granting exploration licenses in areas determined by Turkey and Libya.

""It would be the exercise of our sovereign rights in our continental shelf in the region,"" Cavusoglu said. ""The exercise of our sovereign rights also and naturally includes our right to deploy research vessels in the area,"" he was cited as saying.

In a first reaction from the United States on the agreement, a senior State Department official said the maritime accord was ""unhelpful"" and ""provocative"".

Responding to those comments, Turkey's Communications Director Fahrettin Altun said on Sunday the United States refused to understand Turkey's legitimate security concerns.

""It is neither 'provocative' nor 'unconstructive' as some US officials are claiming,"" Altun said on Twitter.

The Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) struggled to govern large swaths of Libyan territory, as it did not exercise control in several parts of the country. The judicial system was not fully functioning, as courts in major cities throughout the country have not been operational since 2014. Violence driven by militias, civil unrest, and increased lawlessness continued to plague Libya throughout the reporting period. Extra-legal armed groups continued to fill a security vacuum across the country; such groups varied widely in their make-up and the extent to which they were under the direction of state authorities. These groups also committed human rights abuses, including unlawful killings. During the reporting year, there were continued reports that criminal networks, militia groups, government officials, and private employers exploited migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in sex and labor trafficking. Endemic government corruption and militias' influence over government ministries contributed to the GNA's inability to effectively address trafficking.

GOVERNMENT EFFORTS

Lack of institutional capacity, as well as lack of Libyan law enforcement, customs, and military personnel, especially along its borders, hindered authorities' efforts to address human trafficking crimes. Libyan law criminalized some forms of sex trafficking, but did not criminalize labor trafficking. Articles 418, 419, and 420 of the penal code criminalized some forms of sex trafficking involving women, and prescribed penalties of up to 10 years' imprisonment and a fine between 100 and 500 Libyan dinars ($72-$361), which were sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes such as rape. However, inconsistent with international law, the definition of trafficking within these provisions required transnational movement of the victim and did not criminalize sex trafficking acts that were induced through fraudulent or coercive means. The law did not criminalize sex trafficking involving adult male victims. Article 425 criminalized slavery and prescribed penalties of five to 15 years' imprisonment. Article 426 criminalized the buying and selling of slaves and prescribed penalties of up to 10 years' imprisonment. These penalties were sufficiently stringent and, with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes.

Libya's criminal judicial system was not fully functioning in 2018. The Ministry of Interior (MOI), which was nominally responsible for anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, was unable to carry out any anti-trafficking operations during the reporting period. Libyan police forces were not adequately staffed or funded. In late 2018, the MOI formed a Human Rights Office, which was granted arrest authority and the responsibility to investigate human rights abuses, including human trafficking crimes, perpetrated by police officers. To improve law enforcement capacity, the GNA -- in partnership with international organizations -- provided anti-trafficking training to several hundred police officers in Tripoli in December 2018. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) did not report statistics on prosecutions or convictions of trafficking offenders, including government officials who were allegedly complicit in trafficking crimes or government-aligned militias and other armed groups that recruited and used child soldiers. In January 2019, the Office of the Attorney General issued arrest warrants for 35 individuals allegedly involved in human trafficking and migrant smuggling crimes. The Attorney General's Office reportedly continued to investigate 205 people, for whom it issued arrest warrants in the previous reporting period, on allegations of human trafficking and other crimes related to a widely publicized 2017 case. However, it did not report additional information about this case.

International observers reported rampant complicity of government officials involved in human trafficking and migrant smuggling operations, including Libyan Coast Guard officials, immigration officers, security officials, Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials, members of armed groups formally integrated into state institutions, as well as officials from the MOI and MOI's Department to Combat Irregular Migration (DCIM). Several credible sources continued to report that DCIM prison officials and detention camp guards forced detained migrants and refugees to work in DCIM-run detention centers and on farms and construction sites. According to an international organization, the Special Deterrence Force, which nominally operated under the MOI, was involved in the trafficking of detained migrants and benefited from extortion payments sent by the migrants' family members for the migrants' release. Additionally, during the reporting period, the MOD continued to operate an anti-illegal migration unit with strong affiliation to one of the two armed groups involved in migrant smuggling and human trafficking in northwestern Libya; this allegiance allowed the armed group to continually shift its activities from committing smuggling and trafficking crimes, to policing migrants for the government. In June 2018, the UN and the United States sanctioned a top regional leader of the Libyan Coast Guard's Unit in the city of Zawiya and the leader of the Shuhada al-Wadi militia, who ran the GNA-controlled Nasr migrant detention center, for alleged involvement in human trafficking and migrant smuggling. The GNA removed the Coast Guard official from his position, but it did not initiate further investigation or prosecute either official for these allegations. The GNA was supportive of these sanctions and issued public statements of condemnation against the trafficking and smuggling of migrants.

The government did not have any policy structures, institutional capacity, or resources to proactively identify and protect trafficking victims among vulnerable groups, such as foreign migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, women and girls in prostitution, child victims of sexual abuse, and children recruited and used by armed groups. The government also did not provide permanent or temporary residency status to trafficking victims. Female victims of trafficking and other crimes faced sexual harassment and assault and degrading treatment by predominantly male law enforcement and judicial officials in Libya. The government continued to operate rehabilitation centers for women in prostitution and victims of sex trafficking and other forms of sexual abuse; however, these centers reportedly operated as de facto prisons, and international observers documented incidents of abuse in these centers.

The government regularly arrested, detained, and otherwise punished victims for unlawful acts traffickers compelled them to commit, such as immigration and prostitution violations. DCIM operated more than 20 official detention centers across the country where it arbitrarily and indefinitely detained approximately 5,000 male, female, and child migrants throughout the reporting period; the number of migrants in the detention centers decreased substantially from 20,000 migrant detainees reported at the end of 2017 due to a concerted effort by international organizations and donor states to repatriate the migrants throughout 2018. Nevertheless, these detention facilities suffered from massive overcrowding, lack of basic infrastructure, dire sanitation problems, and food shortages. Detained migrants -- including trafficking victims -- had no access to medical care, legal aid, and other forms of protective services. DCIM guards subjected detainees to severe abuse, forced labor, unlawful killings, and rape and other forms of sexual violence. No DCIM detention centers employed female guards, except for the Tariq al-Sekka detention center, where in January 2018 it hired an unknown number of female personnel to staff a section of the center reserved for women and child migrants. An international organization reported the climate of impunity for sexual violence, and lack of safeguards in these centers created an environment where women and girls in detention were highly vulnerable to sexual exploitation. In 2018, the Director of the DCIM issued instructions to 26 DCIM-run detention centers with explicit directions to treat detained migrants humanely, which included issuing information to migrants about their rights under Libyan law. Despite these directives, many militia groups in charge of detention centers around the country did not observe these directives and procedures, in part because they benefited from involvement in trafficking crimes. The Director also ordered the closure of five DCIM-run centers where gross human rights violations reportedly occurred.

The government did not have formal procedures to safely and humanely refer or transfer to protective care identified trafficking victims, including those detained, arrested, or in custody. However, during the reporting period, the government cooperated with international organizations and NGOs to provide assistance to refugees and migrants, a population highly vulnerable to trafficking, in official government-run detention centers. In December 2018, the MOI and an international organization jointly opened a transit center for migrants and refugees in Tripoli, which was managed by a relief organization, to provide more humane conditions for as many as 1,000 detainees; however, the GNA did not have policies in place to identify potential trafficking victims among the population in this facility. Libyan authorities continued to cooperate with international organizations to repatriate, resettle, or evacuate migrants, which likely included unidentified trafficking victims. The GNA processed the necessary permits and facilitated exit visas to allow an international organization to conduct more than 16,000 flights to repatriate migrants in 2018; it also allowed the evacuation of 4,080 refugees and asylum seekers. The government did not, however, provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they could face hardship or retribution.

Libya is a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol, but the government lacked the institutional capacity and resources to prevent human trafficking. Alleged government complicity further exacerbated the overall human trafficking problem in the country and the region. While the government's efforts to close some detention facilities prevented migrants in those locations from further exploitation, migrants in other DCIM-run detention centers remained highly vulnerable to trafficking. During the reporting period, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) improved regional cooperation on migration issues to which trafficking was inextricably linked in Libya with the African Union, and established a regional mechanism to discuss migration issues in Libya, Chad, Niger, and Sudan. The MFA also continued to co-chair a migration working group with an international organization, which focused on developing a migration management strategy and writing an inter-ministerial study on border security. During the reporting period, the GNA continued to coordinate with the Italian government to disrupt human trafficking and migrant smuggling operations, substantially reducing the flow of irregular migrants crossing the Mediterranean. However, some European and international NGOs criticized this coordinated effort of turning migrant boats back to Libya and stopping other migrants from attempting the crossing to Italy, citing severe security and human rights conditions and an increased risk of trafficking for migrants forced to remain in Libya. In turn, the Italian government and other European governments documented how some European and international NGOs working to assist migrant populations partnered with smuggling groups inside Libya in order to help these migrants cross the Mediterranean. The GNA did not have a national coordinating body responsible for combating human trafficking. The government did not conduct any public anti-trafficking awareness campaigns, nor did it take actions to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, child sex tourism, or forced labor. However, in December 2018, the Criminal Investigation Department within the Ministry of Interior partnered with an international organization to train police officers on document forgery, including those used by traffickers and migrant smugglers. The government took no steps to prevent the recruitment and use of children by militia groups, groups affiliated to or aligned with the government, and other armed groups operating throughout the country. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for its diplomatic personnel.

TRAFFICKING PROFILE

As reported over the past five years, human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Libya. Instability and lack of government oversight in Libya continued to allow for human trafficking crimes to persist and become highly profitable for traffickers. Trafficking victims -- including men, women, and children -- are highly vulnerable to extreme violence and other human rights violations in Libya by government officials and non-state armed groups, including physical, sexual, and verbal assault; abduction for ransom; arbitrary killings; inhumane detention; and child soldiering. Credible reports since 2013 indicate numerous armed groups and militias, some of which are used as combat forces or security enforcement by the government, recruit and use children; an international organization documented incidents in 2018 in which local armed groups forcibly recruited boys aged 13-15 years old. Children associated with armed groups in Libya are also reportedly exposed to sexual violence. Uncorroborated media reports in 2018 also claimed that ISIS trained and used children in suicide attacks, to fire weapons, and make improvised explosive devices.

Migrants in Libya are extremely vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking, including those seeking employment in Libya or transiting Libya en route to Europe. As of December 2018, an international organization documented at least 663,445 migrants in 100 municipalities in Libya. The country continued to serve as a significant departure point for migrants, including unaccompanied minors crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa; however, the numbers of sea departures from Libya to Italy substantially decreased throughout 2018. Elements of the GNA Libyan Coast Guard reportedly work with armed groups and other criminals, including traffickers, to exploit migrants for profit. There are financial incentives for smugglers and traffickers to prevent the disembarkation of migrants transiting the Mediterranean and to re-transit migrants back to Libya for detention and further exploitation. A fear of GNA Libyan Coast Guard units, who return migrants rescued at sea to detention centers in Libya where they may be subjected to forced labor, led some migrants to refuse the help of these units at sea. Various armed groups, criminal gangs and networks, smugglers, and traffickers, have cooperated and competed in the smuggling and trafficking of migrants to and through Libya, while carrying out serious human rights abuses and violations against migrants. Highly organized trafficking and migrant smuggling networks that reach into Libya from Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, and other sub-Saharan and Sahel states subject migrants to forced labor and sex trafficking through fraudulent recruitment, confiscation of identity and travel documents, withholding or non-payment of wages, debt-based coercion, and verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. In some cases, migrants reportedly pay smuggling fees to reach Tripoli, but once they cross the Libyan border they are sometimes abandoned in southern cities or the desert where they are susceptible to severe forms of abuse and human trafficking. For example, in January 2018, 94 migrants escaped detention by their smugglers in the border area of Tazerbou Municipality while transiting northward to disembarkation points; these migrants were highly vulnerable to trafficking. In May 2018, 100 migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia -- some of whom may have been trafficking victims -- escaped a camp in Bani Walid where they were reportedly tortured.

Several credible sources continue to report that migrants held in detention centers controlled by both the DCIM and non-state armed groups and militias were subjected to severe abuse, rampant sexual violence, denial of medical care, and forced labor. Private employers and DCIM prison officials use detained migrants from official and unofficial detention centers for forced labor as domestic workers, garbage collectors, and construction, road paving, and agricultural workers. Once the work is completed, employers return the migrants to detention. In some cases, detained migrants were forced to work in exchange for their release from prison. In November 2017, an international media outlet released a video depicting unidentified individuals selling African migrants reportedly for labor in an undisclosed location in Libya. Furthermore, an international organization reported in 2017 that many militias in Libya fill their ranks with migrants from Niger, Nigeria, and Chad to perform labor or to serve in other non-combat roles.

There is a reported high prevalence of sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence and exploitation of female migrants either along the migration routes to Libya or once inside Libya, including in GNA-run and militia-run detention facilities; perpetrators of sexual violence against female migrants include various armed groups, smugglers, traffickers, and GNA officials. Prostitution rings reportedly subject sub-Saharan women and girls to sex trafficking in brothels, particularly in the towns of Ubari, Sebha, and Marzouq in southern Libya; Nigerian women and girls and Ivoirian women are at increased risk of forced prostitution in Libya. According to a European NGO, Nigerian gangs recruit Nigerian girls from rural regions of the country and facilitate the transportation of the girls through Libya for sex trafficking in Italy and other European countries. For example, in 2016 a trafficking network that spanned from Nigeria to Italy via Libya involved a group of Nigerian and Libyan traffickers that forced Nigerian women into prostitution in both Libya and Italy; the network held the victims in warehouses in Sebha and Tripoli until it transported them to Sicily for further sexual exploitation. In 2015 and 2016, ISIS in Libya abducted and took into captivity at least 540 migrants and refugees, including at least 63 women whom ISIS forced into sexual slavery for its fighters. However, since the defeat of ISIS across most of eastern Libya, there were limited reports of such incidents in 2018.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli', 'United States', 'Italy', 'Chad', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Nigeria', 'Niger', 'Ethiopia', 'Eritrea']",2019 Trafficking in Persons Report - Libya,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2019/06/28/2019-trafficking-in-persons-report-libya/,None,
11398722,2019-06-26,"The interim constitution states Islam is the state religion and sharia the principal source of legislation. It accords non-Muslims the freedom to practice their religion and bans discrimination based on religion. The activities of non-Muslims remained curtailed by legal prohibitions on the distribution or publication of information aimed at changing Libya's ""social structure,"" which were used to prohibit circulation of non-Islamic religious materials, missionary activity, or speech considered ""offensive to Muslims."" Human rights activists said freedom of conscience for converts to Christianity, atheists, and Sunni Muslims who deviated from Salafist interpretations of Islam was not respected in practice, particularly in areas of the country controlled by Salafist groups. The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) remained in office, but it did not exercise control over large parts of the country, including in the South and East. The GNA relied on armed groups to provide security and administer some detention centers for migrants and refugees in the country, where, according to multiple international human rights organizations, Christians said they faced a heightened risk of physical assault, including sexual assault and rape than other migrants and refugees. In the West, the Tripoli-based Rada Special Deterrence Force (SDF), a GNA-aligned Salafist armed group integrated into the Ministry of Interior by GNA decree in May, was involved in several arrests and detentions of individuals whom it accused of violating Islamic law. Some detainees reported they were tortured and abused. In February the SDF arrested a woman it accused of practicing sorcery. According to a Refugees International Field Report, an Ethiopian Christian woman said she and other Christians hid their crosses from police in the detention center where they were being held ""because the Libyan police working in that place didn't appreciate Christians."" According to the same report, a 26-year-old Christian refugee who was held in a detention center in central Tripoli said guards provided better treatment to migrants from majority-Muslim Morocco than others. Domestic human rights activists continued to report a restrictive environment, including efforts designed to prevent women from traveling alone outside the country. In Tripoli some militias associated with the GNA reportedly imposed restrictions on women's dress and movement and punished men for behavior they deemed un-Islamic. A draft constitution issued by the Libyan Constitutional Drafting Assembly in 2017, not yet passed by the House of Representatives and put to a referendum, would prohibit non-Muslims from serving in high offices of state.

The East operated under a separate, unrecognized governmental administration, with security provided by the ""Libyan National Army"" (LNA) and LNA-aligned Salafist armed groups. Nonstate actors and militias continued to operate and control territory throughout the country, including in Benghazi, parts of Tripoli, and Derna, where there were numerous reports of armed groups restricting religious practices, enforcing compliance with sharia according to their interpretation, and targeting those viewed as violating their standards. According to the Christian rights advocacy group Open Doors USA, Islamic militant groups and organized crime groups targeted religious minorities, including Christian migrants, converts to Christianity, and foreign residents for physical attacks, sexual assaults, detentions, kidnappings, and killings. Salafist and Islamist groups aligned with the GNA and the unrecognized government in the East took on law enforcement functions. U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations that included Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM), and ISIS continued to operate within the country. Human Rights Watch reported that on January 23, an unidentified armed group or groups detonated two car bombs in front of the Baya'at al-Radwan Mosque in Benghazi as worshippers were leaving after evening prayers, killing at least 34 males, including three children, and wounding more than 90 others. In December the Reuters news service reported local authorities said they had exhumed from a mass grave near Sirte the bodies of 34 Ethiopian Christians executed by ISIS in 2015.

According to international media, former Muslims faced intense social and economic pressure to renounce their faith to return to Islam. Sources also reported converts to other religions, as well as atheists and agnostics, were threatened with violence or dismissal from employment because of their beliefs. According to an atheist from Benghazi, he had to reaffirm publicly faith in Islam (which contradicted his private beliefs) due to threats against his person by coworkers and Salafist militia groups.

The U.S. Embassy to Libya continued to operate from Tunis, Tunisia. The U.S. government continued to raise issues of religious freedom in conversations with the GNA, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other interlocutors. U.S. officials raised these issues in the context of confronting violent extremist groups such as ISIS, as well as condemning acts of physical mistreatment of religious minorities in detention; destruction of religious property; and calling for ending discrimination in the religious education curriculum, particularly discrimination against religious minorities.

Section I. Religious Demography

The U.S. government estimates the total population at 6.7 million (July 2018 estimate). According to reports by the International Organization for Migration, 12 percent of the population (approximately 804,000 persons) are migrants. Sunni Muslims represent 97 percent of the population, and the remaining 3 percent includes Ibadi Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Baha'is, Ahmadi Muslims, and Buddhists. Many members of the Amazigh ethnic minority are Ibadi Muslims. Human Rights Watch reported in 2017 that, according to the Libyan Tamazight Congress, an organization that advocates on behalf of the Amazigh community, Ibadi Muslims account for between 4.5 and 6 percent of the population. Nearly all non-Muslim residents in the country are foreigners.

Estimates of the number of Christians in the country vary. According to the Open Doors USA's 2019 World Watch List Country Profile (which covers 2018), there are 37,900 Christians in the country. In 2015 Open Doors USA estimated 150 to 180 of these were Libyan nationals who converted from Islam.

Foreign Christian communities consist almost exclusively of sub-Saharan African migrants and Filipino foreign workers, with smaller numbers of Egyptian migrants and a small number of other foreign residents of European nationality. According to Christian groups in Tripoli, most of the Egyptian Christians are Copts. Most sub-Saharan African and Filipino migrants are Catholic, and the Catholic diocese of Tripoli estimates its followers include 5,000 sub-Saharan and 3,000 Filipino individuals. Estimates on the numbers of other Christian groups vary. According to Open Doors USA, these include Anglicans, Greek and Russian Orthodox, and nondenominational Christians.

According to the World Holocaust Remembrance Center Yad Vashem, no Jewish individuals reside permanently in the country.

Section II. Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The 2011 Constitutional Declaration functions as the interim constitution. It states Islam is the state religion and sharia is the principal source of legislation, but it accords Christians and Jews the freedom to practice their religions and guarantees state respect for their personal status laws. Christian and Jewish familial religious matters, such as divorce and inheritance, are governed according to the mandates of the religious community to which the individual belongs. The interim constitution also states ""there shall be no discrimination among Libyans on the basis of religion or sect"" with regard to legal, political, and civil rights. Religious minority communities other than Christians and Jews, however, are not accorded equal rights under the law. The GNA remains bound by the constitutional declaration until a new constitution is passed by the House of Representatives and a public referendum held. The laws governing religious practice predate the internal conflict and provide a national legal framework for religious freedom.

There is no law providing for individuals' right to choose or change their religion or to study, discuss, or promulgate their religious beliefs. There is no civil law explicitly prohibiting conversion from Islam to another religion or prohibiting proselytization; however, the criminal code effectively prohibits missionary activities or conversion. It includes prohibitions against ""instigating division"" and insulting Islam or the Prophet Muhammad, charges that carry a maximum sentence of death. The criminal code prohibits the circulation of publications that aim to ""change the fundamental principles of the constitution or the fundamental rules of the social structure,"" which are used to criminalize the circulation of non-Islamic religious material.

The GNA and the East each have a Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (MEIA). The MEIAs administer mosques, supervises clerics, and has primary responsibility for ensuring all religious practices conform to state-approved Islamic norms. Religious instruction in Islam is required in public and private schools. Attendance at religious instruction is mandatory for all students with no opt-out provisions.

Sharia governs family matters for Muslims, including inheritance, divorce, and the right to own property. Under sharia, a Christian or Jewish woman who marries a Muslim man is not required to convert to Islam; however, a non-Muslim man must convert to Islam to marry a Muslim woman. Marriages between Muslim men and women of non-Abrahamic faiths are illegal under sharia, and such marriages are not recognized, even when contracted abroad. The MEIA administers non-Muslim family law issues, although there is no separate legal framework governing non-Muslim family law. The ministry draws upon neighboring countries' family law precedents for non-Muslims.

The country is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

GOVERNMENT PRACTICES

Due to the fact that religion, politics, and security are often closely linked in the country, it was difficult to categorize many incidents as being solely based on religious identity.

The internationally recognized GNA remained in office, but did not exercise control over large parts of the country, including in the East and South.

The United Nations Development Program reported the judicial system was functioning, albeit at different levels depending on the location of the courts within the country. Human Rights Watch, however, said key institutions, ""most notably, law enforcement and the judiciary,"" were dysfunctional or had stopped working in most parts of the country. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) reported courts in the areas controlled by the GNA continued to sentence defendants to corporal punishment in accordance with its interpretation of sharia, including flogging for adultery and amputations for theft; however, according to UNSMIL, the government did not routinely carry out these punishments in practice.

According to international NGOs working in the country, a variety of groups - revolutionary brigades, tribal militias, and local strongmen - provided security in and around courts. The GNA incorporated several of these armed groups into the Ministry of Interior, but observers said the GNA's control over these groups remained limited. Christian groups operating in the country identified the SDF as among the Islamic militant groups involved in the harassment of Christians. The GNA's response to instances of violence against members of minority religious groups was limited to condemnations of acts of violence. For instance, in September, the GNA condemned clashes that broke out between armed groups in Tripoli that caused the displacement of thousands of non-Libyan migrants in the capital.

The SDF, while formally a counterterrorism force, also engaged in other functions including policing on moral and religious issues. According to human rights activists, SDF continued to be involved in a number of arrests and detentions of individuals whom it accused of violating Islamic law. Detainees reported torture and abuse at the hands of the SDF while being held in official and extrajudicial detention facilities. Christian groups pointed to the example of a Coptic Christian man who said that in 2017, the SDF detained him at Mitiga Airport Prison facility in Tripoli for two weeks. The man said he was flogged twice a day during his detention.

According to media reports, on February 22, the SDF arrested a Moroccan woman, Ghizlane Soukane, in Tripoli, on charges of practicing sorcery and magic. There was no update on her whereabouts or the status of her case at year's end.

The National Committee for Human Rights in Libya reported that in October, following the committee's intervention, an Egyptian Coptic resident, Kirlus Hani Abdulmalik, was released from detention at the SDF-run Mitiga Airport Prison facility. Abdulmalik, a pharmacist, was detained since December 2016 without charge, reportedly because SDF forces believed it was illegal for Abdulmalik to practice medicine and provide treatments to Libyans because he was non-Muslim.

On February 26, the Office of Islamic Endowments and Islamic Affairs in Misrata, a regional affiliate of the GNA's MEIA, arrested Abdulaziz al-Siawi, a member of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood's Shura Council, for explicitly calling for terrorist operations in Egypt, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, in response to those governments' anti-Muslim Brotherhood policies. Earlier in February a surreptitiously recorded video was released of a December 2017 Friday sermon al-Siawi delivered at the Mosque of Al-Sheikh Mohammad in Misrata in which he said ""Let me say [clearly] that I want to call for terrorism."" On March 2, members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, together with members of the Council of Elders and Shura, which is headed by Ibrahim bin Ghashir, demonstrated at the courtyard of the Sheikh Amhamed Mosque against the decision of the GNA to prohibit al-Siawi from delivering sermons. Authorities subsequently released al-Siawi.

The GNA relied on armed groups to provide security and administer some detention centers for migrants and refugees in the country, where, according to multiple international human rights organizations, Christians said they faced a higher risk of physical assault, including sexual assault and rape, than other migrants and refugees. According to the Refugees International Field Report published in April, a 23-year-old Ethiopian Christian woman identified as Sara said she and other Christians hid their crosses from police in the detention center where they were being held ""because the Libyan police working in that place didn't appreciate Christians."" In the same report, a 26-year-old Christian refugee from South Sudan identified as David, who was held in a detention center in central Tripoli, said guards provided better treatment to migrants from majority-Muslim Morocco than to others.

In September seven Christian migrants who, along with 173 others were repatriated to Nigeria on August 30, told Black Christian News Network One they had been detained in Osama Prison in Zawiya. One of the men said guards hung him in chains overnight and left him to die. In the morning they took his body to a shallow grave in the forest, but, upon discovering he was still alive, brought him back to the prison, and put him in solitary confinement. Authorities returned the men to Nigeria following the intervention of the International Organization for Migration.

The government permitted religious scholars to form organizations, issue fatwas, and provide advice to followers. The fatwas did not have legal weight but conveyed considerable social pressure, according to Libyan tribal and religious leaders. The GNA, however, did not exercise effective administrative control of mosques and supervision of clerics outside the limited areas under its control.

In Tripoli, according to civil society contacts, women's rights activists, and human rights NGO officials, some militias, such as the GNA-associated SDF and the Nawasi Brigade, imposed restrictions on women's dress and movement and punished men for behavior they deemed ""un-Islamic."" There continued to be no laws, however, imposing restrictions on dress.

In August the Ministry of Education issued a decree suspending admission to special religious schools, including the Religious Academy in Tajoura. During the suspension, the ministry conducted a review of the curriculum at these schools to ensure its interpretation of the Quran and Islamic hadith did not contain hateful or incendiary language toward other religions. Former Grand Mufti of Libya Al-Sadiq Abdulrahman al-Ghiryani and Salafist religious figures condemned the suspension, which remained in place at year's end. The Ministry of Education worked with the U.S. embassy to promote religious tolerance in the country through the dissemination of new civil education curricula for grades four to nine that promote inclusivity and tolerance. The curricula aimed to replace previous material containing discriminatory language directed at non-Muslims.

Government officials at airports throughout the country continued to prevent women from traveling alone outside the country without a male guardian, although there was no law or government regulation restricting such travel. NGOs with local staff reported women often had male relatives accompany them to the airport and carried written permission from their male guardians to enable them to leave the country.

According to human rights activists, the role of Islam in policymaking remained a major point of contention among supporters and opponents of political Islam, Salafist groups, and those who wished for a greater separation between religious practice and political issues. The draft constitution would maintain sharia as ""the source of legislation."" The draft constitution would also ban non-Muslims from key offices of state including the presidency, legislature, and prohibit non-Muslims from being appointed cabinet ministers.

ABUSES BY FOREIGN FORCES AND NONSTATE ACTORS

During the year, nonstate actors and militias continued to operate and control territory throughout the country, including Benghazi and parts of Tripoli. In Derna, prior to the LNA operations to take the city, there were numerous reports of armed groups restricting religious practices, enforcing compliance with sharia according to their interpretation, and targeting those viewed as violating their standards.

Multiple sources state Islamic militant groups and organized crime groups targeted religious minorities, including Christian migrants, converts to Christianity, and foreign residents for physical attacks, sexual assaults, detentions, kidnappings, and killings. Christian groups operating in the country identified the LNA-aligned Madkhali Salafist groups operating in Benghazi as among the Islamic militant groups involved in harassment of Christians. Academic studies and media describe the Madkhali movement as a form of very strict Salafism.

According to a Christian group operating in the country, Christian residents continued to report abuse at the hands of militant Muslim groups, including members of the former Libya Shield Force affiliated with the Libyan Dawn battalion, whose physical mistreatment of detainees included floggings, exposure to cold weather, and other abuses; they also reportedly threatened Christians with execution by beheading. Christian residents reported similar abuses by other groups, including the Benghazi Revolutionary Brigades (BRB), a jihadist Salafist militia coalition. Christian groups pointed to the example of a Coptic Christian man who, in 2017, was repatriated to Egypt after the BRB kidnapped him and held him for 18 days. He was released after payment of a ransom.

Human Rights Watch reported that on January 23, an unidentified armed group or groups detonated two car bombs in front of the Baya'at al-Radwan Mosque in Benghazi as worshippers were leaving after evening prayers, killing at least 34 males, including three children, and wounding more than 90 other individuals. According to spokespersons for the two main hospitals for emergency and trauma services in Benghazi, the majority of victims were civilians.

In December Reuters news service reported local authorities said they had exhumed from a mass grave near Sirte the bodies of 34 Ethiopian Christians executed by ISIS. According to Reuters, in April 2015 a video posted on social media appeared to show ISIS members shooting and beheading the Christians, who were migrant workers.

Reuters also reported the government returned to Egypt the bodies of 20 Coptic Christians in May. Reuters reported that in January 2015 a video released online appeared to show ISIS members beheading the individuals, together with one Ghanaian Christian, on a beach near Sirte and burying them in a mass grave.

The Christian Science Monitor reported in January that the Madkhali movement grew more influential. The Christian Science Monitor said Madkhali units associated with LNA-affiliated groups functioned as informal police forces. The newspaper said in January members of the Madkhali movement patrolled the streets of Tripoli to stop crime and what they viewed as ""vice"" contrary to Islam and to disrupt ISIS cells and attacks.

The MEIA of the nonrecognized governmental administration in the East exercised its ability to issue fatwas. According to local human rights activists in Benghazi, followers of the Madkhali movement exercised influence over academic institutions, in addition to overt control of MEIA.

On November 12, Mousa Abdalsalam Taieb, Director of Cultural and Religious Conversion Affairs for MEIA in the East, issued a circular calling for takfir (a pronouncement that someone is an unbeliever [kafir] and no longer a Muslim) as the penalty for individuals who celebrated the Prophet Mohammed's birthday; cooked a porridge traditionally prepared for this holiday; or engaged in ritual praise of Mohammed. Sources noted all of these practices were part of traditional Islamic practice in the country.

According to Human Rights Watch, the 2017 MEIA religious edict by the ""eastern interim government"" based in Tobruk remained in effect against Ibadi Muslims, accusing the group of deviance and following an infidel doctrine.

According to Libyan academic researchers, the General Administration for Criminal Investigation in Benghazi continued to conduct investigations of citizens for denigrating Islam and for converting others to Christianity, and proselytizing on social media.

According to human rights activists and political analysts, the MEIA in the East continued to provide texts for Friday services to imams, often including political and social messages. According to media reports, the LNA continued to appoint several imams with Salafist beliefs in areas of its control throughout the East.

U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, including Ansar al-Sharia, AQIM, and ISIS, continued to operate within the country, although there were no reports during the year of explicitly religiously motivated attacks. Sources indicated Ansar al-Sharia maintained connections with extremists in other parts of the country, including AQIM. Following expulsion from Sirte in December 2016, ISIS was believed to be largely confined to nonpopulated areas outside of major cities, as well as to ungoverned regions in the South.

On June 28, the LNA took control of the eastern city of Derna from the Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna (SCMD), an umbrella organization consisting of Salafist groups opposed to ISIS, including Ansar al-Sharia. According to human rights activists, when SCMD controlled Derna, it restricted the freedom of Sunni Muslims to worship or engage in what SCMD considered heterodox religious expression.

In October Ali al-Subaiy, a former Libya Islamic Fighting Group member and an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives seat for the Hayy al-Andalus Neighborhood of Tripoli, gave an interview on the Turkey-based Muslim Brotherhood affiliated Channel 9 television station. Al-Subaiy called Jews ""the descendants of apes and pigs"" and called for ""offensive jihad"" against Jews and Christians. In September al-Subaiy said in an interview on the same channel that ""history informs us that [the Jews] are treacherous and deceitful.""

Section III. Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom

Multiple sources, including international media, and the Arab Organization for Human Rights - Libya (AOHRL) continued to report a restrictive social environment for religious freedom throughout the country. This included intense social and economic pressure on former Muslims to return to Islam. NGOs and a UN agency stated Salafist interpretations of sharia increasingly contributed to this restrictive environment. Religious minorities said converts to other religions, as well as atheists, agnostics, and other nonreligious persons, were threatened with violence or dismissal from employment because of their beliefs or lack of belief. An atheist from Benghazi said he faced discrimination and had to publicly reaffirm faith in Islam (which contradicted his private beliefs) due to threats against his person by coworkers and Salafist militia groups.

Sources said Christians who converted from Islam practiced their faith in semi-secrecy. Open Doors USA stated Christian citizens who were former Muslims faced violence and intense pressure from their families and communities to renounce their faith. Christians said they felt pressure to refrain from missionary activities because of security threats and social pressure from the local community. Catholic authorities also stated Christian migrants from sub-Saharan Africa were more likely to experience discrimination or extortion than Muslims from the same region.

Christian communities continued to exist in Tripoli, where Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant churches operated for foreigners. Christian communities were also present in Misrata, al-Baida, Benghazi, Tubruq, Sebha, Ghat, Ubari, and Murzuq, among other cities. In some cases, such as in Benghazi, Catholic communities continued to worship in places other than church buildings after ISIS destroyed church properties there in 2015. The Catholic cathedral in Benghazi remained damaged and inaccessible after fighting occurred in 2013-15.

According to Human Rights Watch, in late 2017 unidentified individuals attacked two historic Sufi mosques in Tripoli. Unidentified individuals set fire to the Sufi mosque, Zawiyat Sheikha Radiya, causing extensive damage, and destroyed the Sidi Abu Gharara Mosque. There were no reported arrests related to the attacks by year's end.

Section IV. U.S. Government Policy and Engagement

Following the U.S. embassy evacuation from Tripoli and suspension of operations in July 2014, U.S. diplomats have operated out of Tunis, Tunisia, making periodic trips into the country when security conditions permitted. The U.S. government discussed religious freedom on a number of occasions with a variety of local and national leaders, particularly in the context of confronting violent extremist groups such as ISIS. Embassy officials frequently met with human rights activists, including the National Commission for Human Rights in Libya and the AOHRL, to address religious freedom issues. The U.S. government also condemned acts of physical mistreatment of religious minorities in detention and destruction of religious property. The U.S. embassy partnered with the Ministry of Education to disseminate new civil education curricula for grades four to nine that promote inclusivity and tolerance.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Benghazi', 'United States', 'Philippines', 'Libya', 'Sirte', 'Derna, Libya', 'Morocco', 'Ethiopia', 'Egypt', 'Tunis', 'Misrata']",Report on Religious Freedom in Libya,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2019/06/26/report-on-religious-freedom-in-libya/,None,
11398723,2019-05-28,"From 1 February to 31 March 2019, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) documented civilian casualties - 20 deaths and 69 injuries - during the conduct of hostilities across Libya. Victims included 12 men, four women, and four children killed, and 60 men, two women, and seven children injured. The majority of civilian casualties were caused by shelling (11 killed and 51 injured), followed by gunfire (nine killed and 15 injured) and explosive remnants of war (ERW, three injured).

UNSMIL documented civilian casualties in Derna (seven killed and 30 injured), Benghazi (one killed and 13 injured), Murzuq (10 killed and 26 injured), and Sabratha (two killed).

UNSMIL's report also includes casualties from other possible violations of international humanitarian law and violations or abuses of international human rights law in Benghazi, Sabratha and Murzuq.

Casualties from unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO)

On 4 February 2019, three boys aged between 9 and 15 years, were injured when an unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) detonated in Benghazi's Kuweifiya area as they were collecting scrap metal.

Derna

Fighting between the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the Derna Protection Force (DPF), previously known as the Derna Mujahidin Shura Council, resulted in at least seven deaths and 30 injuries to civilians. Most civilian casualties were caused by indiscriminate fire and unguided weapons, such as artillery and mortars, as the LNA increased its operations to gain control of Derna's Old City. While it remains difficult to verify casualty figures, UNSMIL received the following reports:

On 2 February 2019, at least four women and three infants were killed as the LNA shelled Derna's Old City. On 9 February 2019, it was reported that 30 civilians, including one woman, were injured when the LNA shelled Derna's Old City.

Southern Libya

The LNA and local affiliates pursued their advance in southern Libya. On 1 February 2019, LNA-affiliated forces moved from Sabha towards the southwestern town of Ghodwa to attack Tebu forces from the Murzuq's Southern Protection Force and Chadian armed elements. UNSMIL recorded the following civilian casualties during the period:

On 3 February 2019, four civilians were killed and 19 others injured after an LNA airstrike in Murzuq.

On 17 February 2019, also in Murzuq, the LNA launched an airstrike at night, hitting Zawiat Zala's block 17, killing at least one male civilian and injuring two children.

On 4 March 2019, one male civilian was injured when an armed group fired at houses in Umm al-Araneb's Project 5 neighborhood.

On 5 March 2019, unidentified armed men opened fire with a rocket-propelled grenade against a group of civilians watching a football game, killing at least three young boys and injuring four others near the Murzuq football field.

On 9 March 2019, unidentified gunmen opened fire and killed a civilian as he was driving from Murzuq to Traghen.

Incidents against civilian infrastructure

On 9 February 2019, an LNA airstrike hit the runway of the al-Feel oil field in southwestern Libya, damaging the facility. No civilian casualties were reported. On 13 February 2019, foreign workers present at the al-Feel oil field were evacuated over concerns for their security; local workers remained in place.

On 12 February 2019, the LNA entered the Sharara oil field, further to negotiations with Petroleum Facilities Guards. On 17 February 2019, the LNA issued a directive ordering the handover of the oil field to the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and lifting the force majeure status to allow for the resumption of oil production. However, the NOC maintained its position that the force majeure status would not be lifted as long as the security of its employees was not guaranteed.

On 6 March 2019, in Tripoli, unidentified armed men opened fire against the Suq al-Ahad grocery market. No casualties were reported, although the building sustained some damage. The gunmen also blocked the market's main entrance and the headquarters of the neighboring tax collection office .

On the same day, in Sirte, the Sirte Protection Force blocked access to the city's public facilities, including the electricity generating station, to protest against the GNA's failure to pay salaries for the last 14 months.

On 14 March 2019, in Gharyan, the al-Qarya armed group - recently affiliated to the LNA - attacked a governmental building near the municipal council in response to the detention of one of its battalion leaders in Tripoli. No casualties were reported, although some property damage was sustained.

On 16 March 2019, in Bani Walid, unidentified gunmen reportedly vandalized a historic building following a visit by the GNA Ministry of Culture.

On 30 March 2019, in Sirte, a home-made Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detonated at the Kortoba's Mosque. The explosion resulted in property damage. No casualties were reported.

Attribution

The LNA and its affiliates are believed to be responsible for the casualties documented in southern Libya, including airstrikes against Murzuq.

UNSMIL was unable to determine with certainty which parties to the conflict caused the other civilian casualties reported during the period.

Casualties from other violations of international humanitarian law and violations or abuses of human rights

On 1 February 2019, a 22-year-old woman was injured by a stray bullet in Benghazi's al-Kish area. There were no clashes in the vicinity at the time of the incident, and the source of fire was unknown.

On 4 February 2019, a 39-year-old man was injured by a stray bullet in Benghazi's al-Hadiq area. The source of fire was unknown, and there were no clashes in the vicinity of the incident.

On 17 February 2019, a 17-year-old boy was injured by stray bullets in Benghazi's Buzgiba neighborhood and subsequently taken to al-Jalla Hospital for medical treatment. The source of fire was unknown, and there were no clashes in the vicinity of the incident.

On 23 February 2019, a 7-year-old boy was injured by stray bullets in Benghazi's al-Lithi neighborhood. The source of fire was unknown, and there were no clashes in the vicinity of the incident.

Note:

The figures for civilian casualties set out above only include persons killed or injured in the course of hostilities and who were not directly participating in the hostilities. The figures do not include casualties that are not a direct result of hostilities, for example executions after capture, torture or abductions, or casualties caused as an indirect consequence of hostilities. The figures are based on information UNSMIL has gathered and cross-checked from a broad range of sources in Libya, including human rights defenders, civil society, current and former Government officials, local Government employees, community leaders and members, witnesses, others directly affected and media reports. In order to assess the credibility of information obtained, where possible, UNSMIL reviewed documentary information, including medical records, forensic reports and photographic evidence.

The figures are only those that UNSMIL was able to document in the reporting period. They are not likely to be complete and may change as new information emerges about incidents involving civilian casualties that took place during this period.

Similarly, while UNSMIL has systematically tried to ensure that the cases it documented are based on credible information, further verification would be required to attain a higher standard of proof. Due to the security situation, UNSMIL has not been able to carry out direct site visits to all relevant locations in Libya to obtain information. Fear of reprisals against sources further hamper information gathering.

While not all actions leading to civilian casualties violate international humanitarian law, UNSMIL reminds all parties to the conflict that they are under an obligation to target only military objectives. Direct attacks on civilians as well as indiscriminate attacks - which do not distinguish between civilians and fighters - are prohibited. Attacks that are expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects excessive to the anticipated concrete and direct military advantage are also prohibited. Such attacks amount to war crimes that can be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.

In order to ensure greater protection of the civilian population and essential infrastructure, all parties engaged in fighting in Libya must cease the use of mortars and other indirect weapons and imprecise aerial bombardments in civilian-populated areas, and not place fighters or other military objectives in populated areas. All executions of captives must cease and all those captured including fighters must be treated humanely in all circumstances. Murdering or torturing captives is also a war crime, regardless of what the captive may be accused of.

Cases highlighted in the ""Casualties from other violations of international humanitarian law and violations or abuses of human rights"" section include casualties caused during incidents that would constitute a violation of international humanitarian or human rights law, but are not a direct result of hostilities, for examples executions upon capture of civilians and others hors de combat (such as captured fighters) and torture causing death. The section also includes casualties caused by the proliferation of weapons and impunity enjoyed by armed groups and criminal networks - considered as indirect consequences of hostilities. Cases highlighted in the ""casualties from other violations"" section are not included in the figures for civilian casualties and include only those that UNSMIL documented during the month.

11398727,2019-01-29,"Historic Economic Agreement Unites Libya's East and West in the Development of One of North Africa's Largest Deep-Sea Ports

International investment firm, The Guidry Group, announced this week that Libya's government authorities in the East and West have come together and formally agreed to jointly support what will become one of North Africa's most highly-automated and largest deep-sea ports near the city of Susah in Libya.

Specifically, the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), known as the Unity Government, in the West in Tripoli and the House of Representatives Interim Government in the East in Tobruk, will cooperate on the billion-dollar 'Port of Susah.'

Michael Guidry, founder and CEO of U.S.-based The Guidry Group, said:

""A historical moment, the development of the Port of Susah has secured the support of both the East and West - the culmination of months of discussions between the once fractured Libyan governments that are now focused on one common objective.

""The pivotal goal of the Port of Susah is not only to spark an economic resurgence and additional investments from the international community, but to chart a new course for Libya and its people.""

Importantly, this is the result of three years of hard work, as well as months of discussions between the Seaport Authority officials in the East and West. These now united representatives of the Libyan people have made it their highest priority to deliver economic opportunity for their people by redeveloping, restoring and modernizing Libya's critical infrastructure, starting with ports and maritime capabilities through the development of the Port of Susah.

Captain Hassan Jwaili, Seaport Chairman of the East, said:

""The Seaport Authorities in the East and West are working closely together on everything related to the ports and maritime capabilities and The Guidry Group is a valued partner that believes in the potential of Libya.

""In addition to the multi-purpose port and logistics center, projected to generate tens of millions of dollars in its first year alone, we have asked The Guidry Group team to join new investors in other opportunities available across our nation.""

The Seaport Authority, the governing authority that manages all the ports in the East and the West, will coordinate development to ensure and guarantee the effective planning and delivery of the Port of Susah.

Dr. Nasereldeen Mehna, a member of the House of Representatives, added:

""The Port of Susah will help to grow our economy and create much needed employment opportunities for our nation's people who are hungry for change.

""In the near future we will see one united government but, in the meantime, we have to open our country for investment in essential infrastructure projects and guarantee the transfer of knowledge and know-how in Libya.""

Port of Susah: Economy, Revenues and Employment

When completed, the Port of Susah, a major international trans-shipment hub container port, will be a crossroads in North Africa for mainline cargo vessels traveling to and from Asia and Europe via the Suez Canal, as well as to and from the United States.

Economy

The Port of Susah will breathe vital economic life into the region, help improve the human condition, and position Libya as a major economic center for trade and commerce once it becomes fully operational upon completion in 2022. The development includes essential world-class regional cargo-handling facilities, improved road networks, employment for Libyan workers as well as expansion of business opportunities elsewhere within the country, and significant benefit in macroeconomic terms.

This is the first-ever design-build-operate-transfer, or D.B.O.T., public- and private-partnership (PPP) infrastructure project in Libya, aimed at paving the way for Libya's economic growth and leading role in regional trade. At the end of the long-term concession, the entire project is transferred to Libya's government as part of the country's resurgence.

Revenues

In 2022, the Port of Susah is expected to generate approximately $60 million in revenues, which are anticipated to double by the year 2040. This excludes additional revenues from handling general and bulk cargo, as well as those generated from the integrated logistics and freight facilities.

Revenue estimates are based on the port being able to handle around 500,000 TEUs {Twenty Equivalent Units] in the first year of operations - Phase 1 of the project - and increasing an anticipated three-times in Phase 2 and 3.

Employment

The Port of Susah project will create significant job opportunities for hundreds of Libyan nationals in a highly efficient, productive and technologically advanced cargo-handling facilities. There will be a significant investment in training facilities that includes simulators and virtual classrooms to ensure that a major source of personnel for the project is local.

The Guidry Group

The Guidry Group was selected from among a competitive field of nine international firms in 2015 to develop the multi-purpose port following a multi-year world-wide solicitation of proposals by Libya's Council of Ministers. Founded in 1985, the international investment firm has become increasingly focused on the development of critical infrastructure, including large-scale projects to help revive war-torn countries by assisting them with rebuilding their economies and communities.

11399043,2019-09-17,"Germany aims to host a conference about Libya this year in conjunction with the United Nations to try to stabilise the oil producing country, where rival factions have been fighting over the capital, Germany's ambassador to Libya said on Wednesday, Reuters reports.

The plans, which are still in the early stages according to diplomats, are the first major diplomatic push since eastern forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar launched in April an offensive to take the capital Tripoli, held by the internationally recognised government of Premier Fayez al-Serraj.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people and derailed years of U.N peace efforts but gone nowhere as Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) has been unable to breach Tripoli's southern suburbs.

U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame last month unveiled plans for an international Libya conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground, without naming a venue.

""Germany therefore initiated a consultation process with key international partners. With sufficient preparatory work these efforts could lead towards a meaningful international event this fall,"" Oliver Owcza, Germany's ambassador to Libya, said on Twitter.

He gave no details on the event announced just after German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament the situation in the north African country risked destabilising the whole of Africa.

Diplomatic sources said the event would be held in Berlin in October or November.

Libya's conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers which have been backing various armed group since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi - the former rebels have been fighting each other since then.

Haftar, who is allied to a parallel government in the east, has for years enjoyed the military support of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, UN reports say.

Turkey has been backing Serraj and has been sending his forces combat drones and vehicles since the start of the war which has balanced out a military edge for the LNA, diplomats say.

Salame thinks Germany can mediate, as it is seen as impartial in the conflict in contrast to France and Italy, which have been competing for influence and have oil and gas interests in Libya, diplomats say.

Both countries brought Haftar and Serraj plus regional players together at summits in Paris and Palermo last year, but didn't achieve a breakthrough.

Germany has strong ties with Turkey and Egypt, whose bilateral ties have been strained since the Egyptian military, then led by Abdel al-Fattah al-Sisi, ousted the Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.

The conference's goal would be to push foreign players to enforce an existing arms embargo and for a ceasefire to allow Libyans to meet afterwards for political talks.

Key obstacles will be to get Turkey to sit with top officials from Egypt and the UAE, Western diplomats say.

The Turkish delegation withdrew at the last Libya conference held by Italy in November after Turkey Vice President Fuat Oktay was not allowed to join meetings between Haftar, Serraj, Sisi and European actors such as Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, according to diplomats.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Germany', 'Tripoli', 'Egypt', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Palermo', 'Turkey', 'Italy', 'France', 'United Arab Emirates']",Germany aims to host Libya Conference,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2019/09/17/germany-aims-to-host-libya-conference/,None,
11399044,2019-07-29,"Remarks of SRSG Ghassan Salamé to the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Libya 29 July 2019

Mr. President [Ambassador Gustavo Meza-Cuadra, Peru],

Allow me to congratulate Peru for its Presidency of the Security Council.

Before beginning my briefing, I would like to pay tribute to the late President of Tunisia Beji Caid Essebsi. President Essebsi was a great supporter of the United Nations and was an active and committed partner to the UN Support Mission in Libya in our efforts to end the Libyan crisis through Tunisia's generous hosting of the Mission. I will personally miss his wisdom, frankness and friendship. He will be greatly missed. Allah yarhumo.

The armed conflict in Libya shows no signs of abating. The war around Tripoli has already left nearly 1100 dead, including 106 civilians. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in the capital and neighbouring districts as a result of the fighting, tens of thousands crossing the border to Tunisia seeking safety for their families.

More than 100,000 men, women and children are immediately exposed to the frontlines, and over 400,000 more in areas directly impacted by clashes. The war has worsened humanitarian conditions and hindered access to food, health and other life-saving services.

The parties, ignoring calls for de-escalation, have intensified air campaigns, with precision airstrikes by aircraft and armed drones.

The geographical scope of the violence has also spread. For the first time on 26 July, Government of National Accord forces launched an air attack on the main rear base of the LNA in the Jufra region. On 27 July, General Haftar's forces launched airstrikes at a Government of National Accord airbase in Misrata.

There is increased recruitment and use of foreign mercenaries, alongside the use of heavy weapons and ground attacks. Forces on both sides have failed to observe their obligations under international humanitarian law.

The most tragic example of indiscriminate attacks was the airstrike that hit a migrant detention centre in Tajoura on 2 July, killing 53 and injuring at least 87, including children. What is even more appalling is that the precise coordinates of the Tajoura detention centre, and other such centres, were shared by the UN with the parties following a previous incident in May. While the vast majority of the fatalities were due to the airstrike, several victims were cruelly struck down by those guarding the center as they attempted to flee. To make matters worse, following UN supported efforts to move the migrants to more secure locations, authorities have in recent days deposited more than 200 migrants back into the bombed facility.

Mr. President,

The tragedy of up to 150 migrant deaths at sea on 25 July again underlines the urgent need to address the root causes of the migrant issue and their immediate suffering.

The UN humanitarian agencies have worked hard to mitigate the terrible conditions in these detention centers. Over 5,000 refugees and migrant people are currently being held at detention centres run by a government agency, of which 3800 are exposed to the fighting. What is required is that they be shuttered. Towards this end, I urge the Council now to call upon the authorities in Tripoli to take the long-delayed but much needed strategic decision to free those who are detained in these centers. UNSMIL has devised a plan for an organized and gradual closure of all detention centers and seeks your support for its implementation.

So far, in 2019, nearly 4,500 refugees and migrants were disembarked in Libya, with serious risks of detention, arbitrary arrest and being trapped by the fighting. The international community can prevent another tragedy. I urge European countries to respond to the Secretary-General's repeated pleas, revisit policies and move migrants and refugees to safety.

Mr. President, I note with alarm the increasing frequency of attacks on Mitiga airport, which serves as the only functioning airport in the greater Tripoli area. Several of these attacks have come perilously close to hitting civilian aircraft with passengers on board. I am afraid that with the almost daily bombardment, luck will run out. I call upon the authorities in Tripoli to cease using the airport for military purposes and for the attacking forces to halt immediately their targeting of it.

Mr President,

On June 26, pro-GNA force retook the city of Gheryan, located some 80 kilometers south of Tripoli. It was a notable development as Gheryan was the first city that the LNA forces entered on their march to Tripoli. There are unconfirmed allegations that human rights abuses may have taken place in the town, which we are investigating.

The recent uptick in violence may worryingly presage a new phase in the military campaign but I do not judge that this will fundamentally alter the strategic stalemate. The parties still believe they can achieve their objectives through military means. Prime Minister Serraj and General Haftar have publicly reaffirmed their commitment to a future political and electoral process but have yet to take practical steps to stop the fighting. The LNA maintains that they will not stop their attack until Tripoli is conquered while the GNA forces insist they can push General Haftar's forces back to eastern Libya.

Libya's present and future need not be taken hostage by the warring parties. While engaging with political leaders and armed groups, UNSMIL is also actively engaging a wide range of constituencies and hosting second track dialogues.

From 13 to 15 July, a meeting gathering 72 Members of the House of Representatives under the auspices of the Egyptian Parliament affirmed the role of the House in a political solution to the Libyan crisis, and called for the formation of a government of national unity without any mention of the need to cease all hostilities. While I commend the efforts of those who met in Cairo to seek an end to the conflict and to form a unified government, I urge them to reach out to their fellow MPs to forge a truly national project. I discourage the trend towards establishing a parallel parliament in Tripoli.

In the same vein, I am troubled by the insistence of authorities in eastern Libya to press forward with the establishment of a parallel municipal elections committee to the national body for municipal elections which already exists. Efforts to delegitimize the work of the national body short-change Libyan voters themselves given the paucity of expertise and resources available to the parallel institutions, cause confusion at the local level, and ultimately impede the country's fragile transition to democracy.

Mr. President,

The hatred and invective on social media and satellite television stations is fueling the violence on the ground. I note that the owners and editors-in-chief of these publications and television stations have invited individuals using a despicable vocabulary of incitement; aired and published calls to violence and assassinations; spread intentionally false news and allowed ad hominem attacks. I urge those who dwell in their self-contained silos of enmity to cease spewing hatred and start talking face-to-face with their compatriots.

Mr. President,

Libya has become a terrain of experimentation of new military technologies and recycling of old weapons. Armed drones, armoured vehicles and pick-up trucks fitted with heavy armaments machine guns, recoilless rifles, mortar and rocket launchers have been recently transferred to Libya with the complicity and indeed outright support of foreign governments. The weapons discovered after the retaking of Gheryan illustrated the advanced systems that are provided. There is no doubt that external support has been instrumental in the intensification of airstrikes.

Without the full cooperation of all Member States regarding the implementation of the measures related to the arms embargo in accordance with Security Council resolution 2473, the flow of weapons to Libya will continue to fuel this needless conflict.

The security vacuum created by the conflict in and around Tripoli continues to be exploited by Da'esh in remote areas in the country's southern and central regions. Among other incidents, Da'esh claimed responsibility on 2 June for a car bomb attack in Derna which resulted in 11 wounded.

Even more worrisome are the indications that the arsenal of weapons being delivered by foreign supporters to one side or the other is either falling into the hands of terrorist groups or being sold to them. Some extremist elements have sought to legitimize themselves by joining the battle. This is nothing short of a recipe for disaster, not only for the safety and security of Libyans themselves, but to Libya's neighbors and international peace and security. It is high time the warring parties cease all hostilities, redeploy their forces, and focus on the common threat before Libya becomes more of a safe haven for terrorist organizations. While I can report that some heed has been recently taken of our warnings, the parties must be urged to decisively disassociate themselves from any violent extremist elements and to actively prevent them from joining the conflict.

Mr. President,

While UNSMIL had to reduce its footprint in Libya due to the security situation, I have also decided that the Mission should not leave Libya. This allows the UN to respond to growing humanitarian needs and human rights concerns, and to remain fully engaged with all interlocutors regarding de-escalation of the fighting and the resumption of the political process.

Since the start of the conflict in and around Tripoli, the UN, in support of local efforts, has provided humanitarian assistance to over 75,000 people. I regret to report that only 30 per cent of the $202 million requested under the 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan has been received to date. The humanitarian community will be unable to respond to increased needs and assist some 100,000 highly vulnerable people impacted by the conflict if no additional funding is received.

Critical infrastructure and vital installations providing water, electricity and other essential services to the population have been damaged by the war. With Libya already in peak demand during the hot summer, deficits in water and electricity supplies have been aggravated by the fighting and deliberate attacks targeting the Man Made River facilities. While Libya's oil continues to flow, the risks to its continued production are as grave as those that imperil the supply of water and electricity. Earlier this month, the National Oil Corporation declared force majeure after valves in the Hamada area were closed by an armed group. The

Mission used its good offices to facilitate a quick resolution to the dispute and force majeure was lifted several days later.

The parallel eastern National Oil Corporation continues its efforts to sell oil in violation of Security Council resolutions. There is a serious danger of the weaponization of oil in this conflict, the consequences of which would be disastrous to the Libyan economy.

The conflict situation has limited the ability of Libyan authorities to meet the basic needs of the population. International and national humanitarian partners provide emergency relief, including in response to floods in Ghat in early June. I led an exceptional humanitarian visit to Ghat on 13 June, where UN agencies delivered emergency food, water and sanitation supplies amongst other provisions needed in the town.

The situation in the South of the country is dire, with a rise in communal violence, particularly in the city of Murzuq. Southern communities face terrible fuel and electricity shortages and an absence of bank notes, in addition to a renewed security vacuum and an increase in terrorist attacks.

UNSMIL has re-established an operational presence in the East, with the re-opened UN hub in Benghazi. My deputy for political affairs conducted an eight-day mission to the east, covering 1,000 kilometers and visiting five cities to demonstrate UNSMIL's commitment to serving all Libyans. We are working hard to open similar hub in Sebha, the capital of the South.

Mr. President,

In the course of the current fighting, serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by all parties have been committed. Residential areas have been hit by indiscriminate shelling and targeted airstrikes. I am particularly worried to see that health workers and facilities are repeatedly targeted, with 19 ambulances and four health facilities struck, many medical doctors and health workers killed including 5 yesterday and others wounded. Impunity should not prevail especially for those who attack hospitals and ambulances. Protecting civilians and humanitarian workers requires sanctions against those committing crimes.

There has been an unacceptable spike in enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions since the outset of hostilities. On 17 July, elected House of Representatives member Siham Sergewa was violently abducted from her home in Benghazi by an unknown group. I have raised Ms. Sergewa's case with the authorities in the east, including yesterday with General Haftar. Ms. Sergewa must be immediately released and those responsible for her abduction must be held accountable. Abductions have also risen at an alarming rate in Tripoli, with numerous government officials, including the Deputy Director of Food and Drugs Administration kidnapped by armed groups to settle scores and extort ransoms.

Mr. President,

Nearly four months into third war since 2011 -- it should be abundantly clear to all that the risks of either an open-ended low-intensity conflict or a full escalation to outright war on the shores of the southern Mediterranean are equally unacceptable.

The decision to stop the war cannot be postponed indefinitely. I therefore submit the following three-part immediate action out of the conflict:

First, I call for a truce to be declared for the Eid al-Adha, which will fall on or about August 10. The truce should be accompanied by confidence-building measures between the parties to include the exchange of prisoners, release of those arbitrarily detained or abducted, and the exchange of mortal remains.

Second, and following the truce, I request a high-level meeting of concerned countries to: cement the cessation of hostilities, work together to enforce the strict implementation of the arms embargo to prevent the further flow of weapons to the Libyan theatre; and promote strict adherence to international humanitarian and human rights law by Libyan parties.

Third, the international meeting should be followed by a Libyan meeting of leading and influential personalities from all over the country to agree on comprehensive elements for the way forward. Such a consensus was on the verge of being built in the run-up to the National Conference in April. It is past time for Libyans to end this long season of mutual suspicion, fear and division.

This triple action will require consensus in this Council and amongst the Member States who exert influence on the ground.

As for the Libyans, they need to listen to their better angels. They are now fighting the wars of others and in so doing destroying their country.

Proposals to revive political talks should be the basis for re-unification of Libyan national institutions. I believe a comprehensive solution to the Libyan conflict will require tackling the underlying drivers of what is ultimately, through not exclusively, a war over resources. The solution, therefore, will need to factor in much-needed structural economic reform and an equitable method to distribute the country's vast wealth.

We have taken a step forward in reinvigorating the audit of the central bank and its parallel eastern branch which will be vital in promoting the unification of the bank and increasing transparency on how national funds are being spent. We have also devised concrete proposals to allow the largest number of Libyans benefit from oil rent, replacing predation with fairness, and self-interested disbursement with welfare for all.

Robust efforts will also be required to combat the smuggling of people, fuel, weapons and drugs - sources of wealth for the armed groups and associated criminal elements. Measures must also be taken to combat the rampant corruption which has infested almost all elements of the state.

Economic reform should be coupled with comprehensive reform of the security sector that would allow Libyan authorities to fight terrorism and secure the country's borders.

Structural security issues, namely the fragmentation of armed groups and the proliferation of small arms, combined with the absence of a unified and professional army have not been addressed since the fall of the former regime. The Libyan state cannot be effective without having an undisputed monopoly over force of arms; this will require collection of weapons outside of the control of the state and a clear civilian oversight over the security structures. Much of the groundwork for these efforts was laid during the military

unification talks sponsored by the Egyptian government in addition to the UNSMIL supported steps taken following last September's violence in Tripoli to reinforce and reform the Interior Ministry. We urgently need to revive that momentum.

Stopping the war requires the will of the parties and the support of the international community. Should the parties agree to silence the guns, the UN and international partners should stand ready to provide material and technical support enabling the parties to negotiate a comprehensive agreement on cessation of hostilities and appropriate mechanisms for its implementation and monitoring. Since the outbreak of the conflict, national governments and regional organizations have called on the Libyan parties to stop the fighting and resume the political process. For that, I am deeply appreciative of the efforts of the African Union, the European Union and the League of Arab States.

People in Libyan cities stop me to convey a clear message: The majority of Libyans believe that it is now time for the Security Council to join this chorus and decisively call for an end to this needless war before it grows into a full-blown civil war with serious, potentially existential consequences for Libya and its neighbours.

Almost seventy years ago, the United Nations decided to create an independent Libya. This body bears a particular responsibility to ensure that Libya does not fracture into weak and unstable pieces but remains the collected strength of the Libya that united in 1951. Only with your imprimatur we can together help the Libyans move past this dark and violent episode and towards a more hopeful and promising future.

The United States is deeply concerned about fighting near Tripoli. We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital.

Forces should return to status quo ante positions. All involved parties have a responsibility to urgently de-escalate the situation, as the UN Security Council and G7 ministers emphasized on April 5. This unilateral military campaign against Tripoli is endangering civilians and undermining prospects for a better future for all Libyans.

There is no military solution to the Libya conflict. This is why the United States continues to press Libyan leaders, together with our international partners, to return to political negotiations mediated by UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ghassan Salame.

11399048,2019-04-05,"The international community has called for calm and restraint in Libya as forces loyal to General Haftar (pictured) moved steadily closer to the capital Tripoli.

On Thursday, Haftar's forces took over Gharyan, a town 100km south of Tripoli. By 3pm local time on Friday, his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) had seized Azizia and Souq Khamis about 40 km from the capital and were engaged in fighting with Tripoli militias from Qasr Ben Ghasir, 20 km south of Tripoli.

The moves, supported by aggressive statements from official LNA sources that Haftar had personally given military orders for his troops to enter the city and instructed its 1.2 million inhabitants to put up white flags in their homes if they wished to stay safe, prompted widespread alarm and condemnation.

A joint statement issued by the governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom, and the United States urged all parties to immediately de-escalate tensions, ""which are hindering prospects for UN political mediation"".

""At this sensitive moment in Libya's transition, military posturing and threats of unilateral action only risk propelling Libya back toward chaos."" The strongly-worded statement read: ""We strongly believe that there is no military solution to the Libya conflict. Our governments oppose any military action in Libya and will hold accountable any Libyan faction that precipitates further civil conflict.""

Analysts were quick to point out online that the UAE, who had been understood to be supporting General Haftar's LNA, in particular in its attempts to defeat Islamic extremism in the east and south of Libya, signed the statement and that Egypt, which has also supported the LNA, was not a signatory.

""The most interesting thing about this statement is not what it says but that it is co-signed by the UAE and not by Egypt,"" said Tim Eaton, a Libya analyst at Chatham House in London.

The European Union issued its own statement calling on ""decision makers"" to ""act responsibly and finally put the national interest first"" in a coded reference to both General Haftar and to Tripoli militia commanders. ""We urge all parties to immediately de-escalate tensions and cease all acts of provocation. There can be no military solution to the Libyan crisis,"" the statement concluded.

The statement came on Thursday after the Tripoli Protection Force, backed by Zawya's Farouq Battalion, fought back against the LNA to regain control over Checkpoint-27 and capturing 100 LNA troops. Armed groups from Misrata and Zintan started moving to cut off LNA supply lines, raising the prospect of escalation into a full-blown civil war.

The last time civil war gripped Libya saw the rise of Islamic State in the chaos.

Both statements echoed earlier words from United Nations General Secretary António Guterres that: ""There is no military solution. Only intra-Libyan dialogue can solve Libyan problems. I call for calm and restraint as I prepare to meet the Libyan leaders in the country.""

Portuguese national Guterres tweeted his statement from Tripoli, where he has been personally making final preparations for the UN-supported National Conference aimed at finding a solution to the political impasse in Libya.

The fate of the conference, a comprehensive reconciliation process due to be implemented in Ghadames this month, remained uncertain with the LNA declaring that the army was ready to secure the conference and prepare a ""suitable environment for success"".

Libya-watchers said that Haftar's military manoeuvres might backfire politically. ""Should Haftar's military strategy fail, it may actually weaken his hand in future negotiations over a political deal should the National Conference proceed later this month. It might also have the unintended consequence of uniting his opponents in opposition against him,"" Eaton said in an emailed statement.

Residents of Tripoli, inured to the ups and downs of the conflicts and rivalries which have ravaged the country since the 2011 Arab Spring, when long-term ruler Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was ousted with the help of NATO airpower, were clearly rattled by Haftar's LNA advances.

While some continued to go to work, traffic flows were notably reduced as people stayed at home. However, there were no signs of white flags being hung from windows and public scorn was directed at a number of ministers in the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) fleeing the capital from Mitiga airport after a VIP flight list was circulated on social media.

GNA Prime Minister PM Fayez Sarraj issued three directives ordering GNA Military Region Commanders to raise alert levels, re-centralise their units and use force and airstrikes to defend civilians and critical facilities against ""terrorists, criminals and those outside the legitimacy"".

However, one GNA source said that lack of leadership by the GNA as well as the growing influence of Moscow were key components of the crisis. ""Haftar is responding in his way to the lack of political power in Tripoli and he is being egged on by Russian political-military advisers, who would like to strike a blow against NATO by reversing the Arab Spring uprising and re-installing Gaddafi-era leaders.""

Russian influence in Libya has become a matter of increasing concern to the West in recent months with media reports of Russian special forces mercenaries working with the LNA and of the Kremlin seeking a greater say in Libya's future, raising fears of a proxy conflict between great powers.

""Russia was a key enabler of the Gaddafi regime and is now seeking strategic control over Libya's energy supplies and migration flows to southern Europe to use against us as part of its broader war on the West,"" said one Western security source on condition of anonymity.

Britain and America both recently announced changes to their Ambassadors. President Trump on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Richard Norland to be the next ambassador to Libya, seeking to fill a key State Department posting in a country still reeling from the aftermath of the Arab Spring.

At the same time, Martin Reynolds CMG was appointed Her Majesty's Ambassador to Libya having previously served as Principal Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in London.

A group of leading Libyan journalists, bloggers and social media influencers attended a workshop on ""Combating Hate Speech and Ethics of Journalism"", held in Cairo last week.

Participants, including eight women, who represent various Libyan media outlets that broadcast/publish from both inside and outside Libya reached a set of recommendations related to the need for defining ""hate speech"" and ways to address it by adhering to the ethical principles of journalism.

The 17 participants stressed the importance of raising awareness of the risks and consequences of hate speech, disinformation, fake news and incitement. They recommended to have appropriate legislation and mechanisms in place for monitoring online and offline inappropriate content, pertaining to hate speech and incitements.

At the closing session, Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) in Libya and Head of UNSMIL Ghassan Salame stressed the importance of joining hands to fight hate speech due to the devastating danger it poses to Libya's social peace and social fabric.

""Hate speech and fake news are very widespread representing a very serious problem,"" according to SRSG Salame. ""Hate speech is a result of the accumulation of negative emotions, which require serious efforts to be treated. It is extremely important to maintain constructive dialogue.""

""Dialogue is also a struggle, not with the other but with oneself,"" added SRSG Salame, ""Because a genuine dialogue commits you to accept the other's otherness, to accept that his otherness is legitimate and, more importantly, to accept to be impacted by the other's views during your dialogue with him or her.""

The two-day workshop, funded by UNDP and facilitated by UNSMIL on 3-4 November, highlighted the disturbing spread of hate speech in Libyan media and social media platforms with a focus on a Human Rights perspective on the Rabat Declaration, particularly on how to address this matter without compromising freedom of expression and human rights principles.

Examples of hate speech, incitement, disinformation and fake news flooding the Libyan media space were presented and discussed by the participants. In addition, Facebook's Policy Team in North Africa presented the latest trends in Facebook, Facebook community standards, and the Artificial Intelligence being deployed to combat fake accounts, hate speech, and inappropriate content.

""We as female journalists face unlimited challenges including incitement and threats on social media. We have to work together- men and women- to address this wave of incitement, hate speech, libel and distortion,"" said Maye Keilani, a TV host in Benghazi.

In addition, Essa Rashwan, a social media influencer and activist, said ""We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss how to combat hate speech in Libyan media, and for engaging Facebook in the discussion. Spread of hate speech and disinformation on Facebook is a very serious concern. It seems to be an organized work contributing to creating further divisions in Libyan society.""

The Cairo workshop is the second in a series of events initiated by UNSMIL's Public Information and Communications Unit as part of an effort to counter hate speech and disinformation in conjunction with ongoing efforts to revive the political process.

11399079,2019-11-26,"Mustafa Sanalla, Chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), said Libya plans to raise its oil production level from 1.25 million barrels a day now to 2.1 million bpd by 2024.

Sanalla revealed the ambitious production target at a one-day conference organised by the Libyan British Business Council (LBBC) in Tunis and said that British companies would continue to be ""vital partners"" for the Libyan oil and gas sector.

Asked by Libya Business News what British companies had to offer Libya to reach the 2024 target, Sanalla replied:

""British companies are our vital partners for over 40 years and yesterday we had many meetings with British colleagues. British technology is amazing, and this is the right environment for British companies to come and to expand in Libya.""

After his speech, the NOC and LBBC signed a joint Statement of Intent on cooperation in the oil and gas sector. They will meet again in London in 2020 to review progress.

""The relationship between Aberdeen, the heart of the UK's oil and gas industry, and Libya goes back decades and our ambition in the LBBC is to see that relationship developed,"" said Sir Vincent Fean, chairman of LBBC and a former British ambassador to Libya.

Sanalla informed LBBC delegates that the 2.1 million barrel target would be reached by new projects to increase production (455,000 bpd), the reinstatement of damaged fields (120,000 bpd), the reactivation of shut-in wells (150,000 bpd) and power generation increases (125,000 bpd).

Increasing Libya's oil output to 2.1 mbd and its gas output to 3.5 billion cubic feet per day would require an investment of $60 billion (£46.5 billion), Sanalla told the LBBC conference, which he said would be ""handled transparently through the NOC's Houston offices"".

Commenting on the NOC targets, Fean urged support and pointed out that given the difficult operating environment in Libya, increased oil production from 150,000 bd at its lowest level to 1.25 mbd today, was already ""nothing short of miraculous"".

Key to Sanalla's plan to increase production in Libya is a holistic security package, labelled ""4-D security"", which includes a revised NOC Charter; bolstering support for oil-hosting communities by providing better services and economic opportunities; the removal of fuel subsidies to eliminate revenue sources for criminal militias and an overhaul of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG).

The Libyan Government spent about $4.2 billion on fuel imports in 2018 of which around $3.7 was subsidised. Sanalla told the LBBC conference that fuel subsidies create huge opportunities for smugglers and had ""propelled some communities into criminality"".

""We have a solution that would allow subsidies to be delivered directly to the consumer, rather than through the fuel,"" Sanalla told LBBC delegates. ""The fuel would be sold at world-market prices, eliminating the profit margin enjoyed by fuel smugglers.""

Sanalla pointed out that oil-hosting communities were the ""first line of our security"" in Libya and unveiled proposals for a NOC fund endowment directly linked to oil production volume that he said has already been approved in principle by the Presidential Council of Libya.

The NOC funds would be distributed to provide finance for entrepreneurs on oil-hosting communities; bolster local healthcare services; provide university scholarships and would contribute to a Communities Prize for ""local heroes"". Sanalla said the NOC was finalising governance plans with international partners.

The PFG has caused problems for Libya in the past, notably when its former commander Ibrahim Jadhran seized the Libyan oil ports Ras Lanuf and Al Sidra in 2018, creating an economic and political crisis that cost Libya more than $1.4 billion in revenue and set back efforts to promote political progress and stability in Libya.

Last week, Sanalla said the force was now better led and trained. ""Working with international partners, we are reforming the PFG,"" Sanalla said.

The estimated total cost of the project is 5.6 billion USD, with production expected to start in the third quarter of 2022 ('A') and 2024 ('E') respectively - adding 760 million MMSCFD and 35,000 barrels of condensate per day to production.

The completion of the Wafa Inlet Gas Compression (WIGC) project was also welcomed by parties - a significant onshore achievement providing increased gas supply to the domestic market.

Cooperation between Eni and the General Electricity Company of Libya (GECOL) to increase electricity generation through the deployment of typical power generation and renewable energy projects was also reviewed.

According to NOC's chairman:

""The completion of Phase 2 is a testament to NOC's ongoing partnership with key international players and our ability to drive international investment to the Libyan energy sector, despite an ongoing backdrop of conflict.

The NOC delegation, headed by chairman Eng. Mustafa Sanalla, was welcomed by CNPC's vice president and president of PetroChina, Hou Qijun, and the chairmen of CNPC's subsidiaries.

Mr Hou expressed China and CNPC's direct interest in progressing cooperation in Libyan exploration and development, oilfield services, and trading of Libyan crude, with parties potentially cementing future relations through the signature of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at their next meeting.

Thanking CNPC for the invitation, chairman Sanalla said:

""In China, NOC has met some of the highest qualified companies in our industry and shared with them opportunities for reconstruction and development investment in our local oil sector. With a more stable security environment, we could easily add between 300-400,000 barrels to daily production and grow oil revenue receipts. Our long-term strategy is to produce 2.1 million bpd by 2023. China can help us on that journey.

""We hope that China and its leading oil sector companies will become partners to our vision for the local oil sector based on mutual opportunities through oil and gas imports, joint exploration and development, and the sharing of technical expertise.""

NOC also visited the headquarters of the Great Wall Drilling Company (GWDC), China Petroleum Technology & Development Corporation (CPTDC), BGP, China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation (CPECC) - CNPC subsidiaries previously operational in Libya.

Chairman Sanalla thanked NOC's hosts for their efforts to enhance Chinese-Libyan cooperation, encouraging them to engage with future commercial opportunities in Libya.

Restoring confidence, promoting transparency, and supporting the reunification of Libya's financial and economic institutions are crucial to Libya's stability and the prosperity. Towards this end, UNSMIL remains committed to facilitating a financial audit review of the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) as requested last year by Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj.

The Secretary General's Special Representative Ghassan Salamé convened the governors of the two branches on two separate occasions in 2018 in order to agree the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the financial audit review. The international financial institutions were also consulted during the process.

The current tender is being issued openly after the closed bidding process, which was launched in early 2019 and ended in April, did not produce a contract with one of the Big Four auditing firms.

On 23 July 2019, the United Nations Office for Project Service (UNOPS), at the request of UNSMIL, re-opened the bidding process for a financial audit review of the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL).

The tendering process will remain open for three weeks after which the UN will select the best offer based on international standards after having consulted the two CBL branches.

The tender is based on a Terms of Reference (TOR) for the audit review agreed upon by the two governors of the two CBL branches.

UNSMIL intends to conduct the financial audit review in a collaborative manner with the objective of creating greater transparency and the conditions for eventual unification of the CBL.

A feasibility study to further develop the field was presented to the NOC Board at corporation headquarters by Dr Khalifa Rajab, chairman of Zallaf's management committee. The Board authorised a series of comprehensive reservoir studies and a development plan to determine existing gas reserves, feasible production rates, and associated development and production costs.

NOC chairman, Eng. Mustafa Sanalla had previously discussed earlier this month the gas link proposal with the Minister of Planning, requesting a budget to fast-track project development to replace crude oil currently used as fuel at the plant.

Libya's Presidency Council recently issued a resolution ratifying NOC supply of the power plant, while the General Electricity Company of Libya (GECOL) has been preparing for the station's commissioning.

""Supplying natural gas instead of crude oil would increase the efficiency of the Obari plant and significantly reduce emissions. The switch to gas would also save at-least 15000 barrels per day that could be sold internationally - further increasing Libya's export capacity and contributing to national revenue growth.

This is the first polymer banknote to be released by the Central Bank of Libya, and one of the first polymer banknotes to be released in the region.

The introduction of polymer as an alternative substrate has been one of the most successful innovations in banknote development in recent years, accounting for a significant reduction in counterfeit rates worldwide.

Safeguard®, De La Rue's polymer solution, allows for considerably improved banknote security, enabling sophisticated and robust security features to be embedded through design. The integration of original, technically advanced polymer design features ensures the security and durability of the banknote throughout its life.

One of the unique public security features of polymer banknotes is the see-through window. On the 1 Dinar banknote, the complex window design depicts Libya's iconic resistance leader Omar Mukhtar (1862-1931), making the banknote distinctive and easily identifiable. The new banknote design also includes engravings of the Central Bank building on the front, and the Brega Oil Refinery and the Arch of Marcus Aurelius on the reverse.

The banknote also features De La Rue's MASK feature, which is integrated into the polymer substrate, and has a simple 'hide and reveal' effect that cannot be easily replicated by scanning or printing and is highly durable. On the 1 Dinar when you lift the banknote and look at the pattern design the number 1 is then revealed.

The newly launched note also includes a complex UV design feature, Gemini, intricate patterns, microprint and secure inks.

Commenting on the new banknote, Governor Al-Siddiq Al-Kabeer said:

""We are delighted with the 1 Dinar design and are pleased to be one of the first countries in our region to be using polymer banknotes. We would like to thank De La Rue for their continued support with this project.""

""Years of conflict in Libya have left behind a struggling and over-burdened health care system. Many health facilities are fully or partially closed, limiting access to health care services to a population suffering from challenges from the 8-year conflict,"" said Dr Syed Jaffar Hussain, WHO Representative in Libya.

A health service availability and readiness assessment by WHO and the Ministry of Health in 2017 revealed that 17.5% of hospitals, 20% of primary health care facilities and 18 specialized hospitals are partially damaged or completely destroyed. Health facilities that remain functional are at continued risk of attack, with more than 41 attacks targeting health workers and facilities reported by WHO in 2018-2019 across the country.

Shortage of essential medicines and health service providers, and limited capacity of national public health programmes, increase the risk of spread of communicable diseases, including acute watery diarrhoea, leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and vaccine preventable diseases. Migrants, displaced people, refugees, and rural communities are especially at risk.

Inadequate access to health care is also impacting patients with chronic diseases, people with special needs and mental health conditions, and women and mothers in need of reproductive, maternal, and newborn child health services.

Despite the health sector receiving only 36% of required funding for the Libya Humanitarian Response Plan in 2018, WHO successfully supported almost 405 000 medical consultations through the provision of medical supplies, more than 16 400 specialized health care consultations, and 188 major surgical procedures, including cardiac surgeries for 78 children.

In December 2018, WHO and UNICEF, in partnership with National Center for Disease Control of the Ministry of Health, implemented a national measles, rubella and polio vaccination campaign that reached more than 2.65 million children.

""Investing in the health of people in Libya is a critical investment in the future of the Region,"" added Dr Jaffar. ""Without funding, hundreds of thousands of people will be left without the health services they need, further adding to this humanitarian tragedy and increasing the risk of diseases crossing borders.""

Thank you very much Mr President. Thank you for scheduling this briefing. Very good to hear from the SRSG so thank you, Ghassan for everything you've said. I wanted to start by thanking you also for restructuring the mission and for the enormous progress made on opening the offices.

I think that's really important. As you were saying it's a good signal of the international community's engagement with the people of Libya and what is happening there so thank you for that. And many thanks to the German Ambassador as well for the sanctions report. Germany is now co-penholder with us on Libya so obviously we look forward to working even more closely together.

I wanted to start Mr President by reiterating my government's strong support for what the SRSG is doing and what the UN are doing on the ground. And our thanks to them for all their efforts. In particular, we support the SRSG's approach to the National Conference. We believe it's the best way of reaching an inclusive political settlement and one which stabilises the country and we hope that all Libyans should come together and engage in this process.

And in particular, Mr President, we hope that a broad spectrum of Libyan society is represented at the National Conference. And we think we should work to ensure that and we look for participants to be drawn from as broader political, regional, tribal and ethnic spectrum as possible. And of course, as this Council always says on these occasions, we look for a proper representation of women.

The Council has been united pretty well so far, Mr President, and we hope that we can rally to the UN action plan and we hope that we can help other members of the international community and ensure that the UN mission is able to implement the outcomes of the National Conference.

The SRSG referred several times to spoilers. And I think what the pattern of attacks he described and the sporadic clashes throughout the country obviously of great concern. I think the Council needs to be very clear, Mr President, Libya's future cannot and will not be determined by spoilers who wish to maintain the status quo purely for their own gain while ordinary Libyan citizens continue to suffer.

And the deteriorating situation on security that the SRSG described simply underscores how unsustainable the status quo is. So we believe, Mr President, that Libya's political institutions need to work with the National Conference and take account of its outcomes. This will signal they have the best interests of the Libyan people at heart and that they're committed to finding a durable political solution to the crisis. The Libyan people will find it very hard to understand if those institutions continue to fail to do what's been asked of them.

I think, on the economy, I was very interested in what the SRSG said about oil. I think again we've got to support the UN mission and the international financial institutions in putting in place further economic reforms. I think we need even more targeted and effective sanctions against spoilers. The progress that's been made with the Central Bank of Libya is also very welcome but obviously it needs to take place in parallel with work to reunify the Central Bank and the Central Bank in the east.

The meeting was also attended by the Chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), Mustafa Sanalla.

Claudio Descalzi assured Sarraj the full commitment of the company to its operational activities and projects in the country and reiterated Eni's commitment in the social area, particularly in reference to the initiatives undertaken in the power generation sector.

Following the Memorandum of Understanding signed last year with GECOL and NOC, Eni has contributed greatly for the improvement of the power sector, supplying much needed spare parts and technical assistance that allowed the recovery of 425 MW of power output in the Tripoli area.

Moreover, Eni will continue its commitment in support of the population of Libya to this very sensitive issue by making available its knowhow and expertise for the development of solar plants and wind farms.

The introduction for the first time of renewable energy in Libya will give an answer to the request of more electrical power for the population without increasing local hydrocarbon consumption. The development of renewable energies in the countries where Eni operates represents a fundamental element in the process of energy transition towards a low-carbon scenario.

The company is already the main supplier of gas to the local market, which is entirely used to feed the country's power plants for a generation capacity exceeding 3 GW.

Eni's CEO has previously had a meeting with the Chairman of the NOC to discuss the status of Eni's current and future projects in Libya.

As for Bahr Essalam (BES), the Phase 2 was successfully completed, bringing the field's total production to 1,100 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMSCFD). The Phase 2 of the project completes the development of the largest gas field in production in the Libyan offshore.

They have also discussed the start-up of the Wafa Inlet Gas Compression (WIGC) project, which is providing a significant contribution to the Libyan energy sector, as a result of the increase in the gas supply destined to the domestic market.

The completion of the WIGC project is a significant achievement and represents an important milestone confirming that project activities can be successfully performed onshore, in this challenging context.

All this was possible thanks to the commitment and support of NOC and the great effort made by the MOG employees, as well as all the contractors involved in the execution of the project.

Wafa started its production in 2004 and is a historical field for Libya. Its production represented approximately the 38% of MOG's overall gas production in 2018.

Remarks of SRSG Ghassan Salamé to the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Libya, 20 March 2019

Mr. President [Ambassador Francois Delattre, France],

Allow me to congratulate France for its Presidency of the Security Council.

I would have wished to be in New York and have the opportunity to brief you in person. However, it is no exaggeration to say that the situation in Libya has reached a crucial juncture. We are working to prevent recent developments and tensions on the ground from escalating, and instead to pivot to stability and a political compact which will enable an end to the crisis in the country.

Mr. President,

On 13 January, the forces of General Haftar peacefully entered Sabha. Whilst there were some minor incidents, the arrival of Haftar's forces was generally perceived as a positive and stabilizing development.

When these forces moved to take control of Murzuq in the South West, there was active opposition from the Tebu community and affiliated armed groups. In the fighting, and in revenge attacks in the immediate aftermath, at least 18 residents of Murzuq were killed and a further 29 injured. Ninety homes were reported burned in revenge attacks by tribal forces under the LNA command.

Whilst the LNA has brought a large measure of security and stability to the South which enabled the parallel bank in the east to deliver bank notes to Sabha, it is unclear how long the campaign can be sustained given the long resupply lines and the limited financial resources of the parallel government.

There has been some mobilization of LNA forces in Jufra as well as the conducting of patrols towards Sirte. This has led to friction and a rise in tensions with forces from the town of Misrata who remain positioned in Sirte after their anti-ISIS operations there.

In the East, the fighting in Derna came to an end. I am deeply concerned by reports of human rights and humanitarian law violations during the recent military operations in Derna. The fighting reportedly resulted in many civilian casualties.

In the West of the country, local forces have mobilized in response to the current tensions. So far, such local mobilizations appear to be shows of force and no party appears imminently ready to launch an attack against any other. But there is a real risk of miscalculation or of extremist forces starting skirmishes in the hope of drawing others into a larger confrontation.

The Tripoli ceasefire continues to hold, but the Greater Tripoli Security Arrangements Plan remains only partially implemented.

Mr. President,

UNSMIL has supported two rounds of preparatory talks between the advisors of Prime Minister Serraj and General Haftar which took place in our Tunis offices. As a result of those talks, the two leaders met in Abu Dhabi and agreed to a number of important principles: Libya shall be a civilian and democratically governed state that enjoys full civilian control of the military, and a peaceful transition of power. The parties also agreed on the need to unify Libya's long-divided institutions and for the scheduling of national elections before the end of the year.

Many of these principles are not new. Indeed, these talks are the continuation of the process which started in September 2017. What is new is the sincerity to turn these words into the end of the transitional period through elections.

Mr. President,

Let me now brief you on other developments and activities on the ground. I am pleased to announce that the UN Hub in Benghazi is open. After many months of being almost open, UN staff are being deployed to Benghazi to better deliver across the East of the country.

Discussion is now underway concerning a further hub in Sabha to support operations in the South of the country and UN programs have also now visited Sabha for the first time since operations were halted there in 2013.

Mr. President,

In my previous briefings I warned against the consequences of the economy of predation. I am encouraged by action taken to combat illegal smuggling. On 7 February the public prosecution issued over 100 arrest warrants against individuals, accused of involvement in smuggling and illegal disposal of fuel and ordered the confiscation of 115 fuel stations. This organized fuel smuggling amounts to more than USD 750 million annually.

Overall, Libya's infrastructure continues to deteriorate at an alarming rate. Basic services, including in health, water and electricity, are eroding. The situation of water production is particularly fragile. With nearly four wells being disabled every month, the western branch of the Man-Made River, which is the primary supplier of water to the north-west, is in imminent danger of collapse.

The 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan for Libya has been launched on 5 February, seeking USD 200 million to continue providing health, protection, water, and shelter to more than half a million of the most vulnerable people in Libya. An estimated 823,000 people, including migrants and 248,000 children, need humanitarian assistance in Libya.

The situation of the economy is mixed. The re-opening of the Sharara oil field, for which the UN played a crucial role, resulted in increased oil production that is returning to 1.2 million barrels per day. The foreign currency exchange fee, in combination with the liberalization of the opportunity to purchase foreign currency, continues to generate revenue, and strengthen the Dinar. This has increased purchasing power and reduced inflation and the profitability of the black market for currency.

While important, these benefits may be short-lived without genuine economic reforms. Such reforms require a direct devaluation of the currency and the lifting of subsidies which consume nearly 10% of the national budget. Working with the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya, the national audit review process will soon begin.

Mr. President,

It is extremely positive that the Central Committee responsible for municipal council elections is starting with a new round of nine elections in the Southern and Western parts of Libya on 30 March. In this context, it is essential that there is only one body managing municipal elections.

The High National Electoral Commission is preparing for national elections. We are pleased to see that the HNEC, with the help of the UN and international partners, has finally now moved into its secure new headquarters.

It is now necessary for the government to provide the necessary operational funding for HNEC to finalise preparations for elections.

Mr. President,

The Mission has been in steady contact with a number of countries and regional organisations, including the League of Arab States, the African Union, and the European Union. I joined the Secretary General at the African Union Summit and welcome the AU's interest in supporting the UN Action Plan. I am grateful for the support expressed for our efforts during the visit of Commissioner Chergui and USG DiCarlo on 12-13 March.

Mr. President,

The National Conference will be held from 14 to 16 April inside Libya. It represents a critical opportunity to end the transitional period, which began eight years ago.

Ahead of the National Conference, we are working with many parties to ensure as broad a buy-in as possible to the political process. What is clear is that the Libyan people fervently desire that their institutions be united as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they are up against powerful forces, which have materially profited from the country's chaos and division and are therefore loath to work towards a unification.

There is much at stake. If the opportunity presented by the National Conference is not seized, then we will be faced with only two possible options: prolonged stalemate or conflict. This stalemate may also ultimately lead to conflict.

Or conflict may erupt much sooner. A failure now to advance the political process demonstrates absolutely that the country is totally controlled by force of arms. But today, we have the ability to step back from the edge of this precipice.

The National Conference offers a crucial opportunity for all parties, with no exclusion, to put aside their differences for the good of the country, to unite, to avoid war and to choose a path of peace and prosperity.

The National Conference will choose whether to endorse the National Charter which was the product of the National Conference consultative process.

It will also chart a roadmap to conclude the transitional period: through simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections, or through phased elections. It will provide recommendations on how to deal with the Draft Constitution produced by the Constitutional Drafting Assembly.

Mr. President,

The days ahead will prove foundational to the years ahead for Libyans and the region writ large. I call on Libyans to come together and to avoid acts of obstruction and incitement. There has been a notable uptick in the weaponization of media platforms as tools of incitement. This is tearing at Libya's fragile but vital social fabric and could well be used to instigate violence. At this sensitive time, I call on all actors to refrain from the use of inflammatory and alienating rhetoric in the public sphere.

I also call on all in the international community to put the interests of the Libyan people first, and to act committedly and sincerely to pressure all parties to avoid conflict and conclude a peaceful formula to end the transitional period in Libya, for the sake of all of the Libyan people.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Sabha, Libya', 'Libya', 'Sirte', 'Tripoli', 'Benghazi', 'Derna, Libya', 'France', 'Tunis', 'Jufra District', 'Misrata']",UN to Hold Libya Conference in April,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2019/03/21/un-to-hold-libya-conference-in-april/,None,

The Ministry of Planning is strongly involved in empowering the Civil Society Organizations to disseminate the entrepreneurship culture within their local communities in Libya.

Expertise France is the French public international cooperation agency. It designs and implements projects which aim to contribute to the balanced development of partner countries, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda and the priorities of France's external action.

Expertise France's mission is to meet the demand of partner countries seeking to enhance the quality of their public policies in order to address the environmental, social, economic and security challenges they are facing. The agency achieves this goal by implementing projects in those main fields.

Expertise France intervenes in Libya over 4 donor-funded projects since 2014, all related to private sector development and entrepreneurship empowerment:

The overall portfolio amounts to 19 million euros, over 4 year. Additional developments are expected in the same field, especially a SLEIDSE 2, with a foreseen starting date early 2020.

The EU4PSL is an EU funded project, started as of Feb 2019, with an aim of improving Libya's business environment in order to generate economic growth for private sector and job opportunities for youth and in particular for women. This project seeks to assist the government of Libya and all relevant stakeholders in their efforts to promote the development of an open, dynamic and diversified economy in Libya.

The project will contribute concrete and practical assistance to key Libyan stakeholders, who have capacity to accelerate the transition towards:

The specific objectives (components) of the programme are:

This first component addresses the needed improvements, in terms of mandate, capacity and competence, of the fundamental institutional players in Libya in terms of the country's economic strategy: MoE and MoF. An intensive set of activities will be implemented to help move the country out of its centralised rent-based economy and help increasing the role of the private sector. To achieve this, however, the MoE and MoF will be heavily involved as they have a considerable political influence.

The MoE and MoF roles in Libya are extremely broad, their mandate is complex, but their overall political influence is considerable. Consequently, the project focuses on three essential elements which constitute core competences of the MoE and MoF, chosen in relation to their potential and capacity to influence and drive change.

The second component spans the entire ""entrepreneurship chain"", from pre-entrepreneurship (increasing capacity of support services) all the way to ""getting into active business"" (facilitating access to funding for entrepreneurs). There exist several entrepreneurs of highly variable levels of advancement, competence and ambition throughout Libya. This component is designed to be able to simultaneously provide its assistance and expertise on an as-needed basis, rather than on a chronological or staggered basis.

The access to finance component aims at facilitating the access to financial services to Libyan entrepreneurs either by improving the services of the existing financial institutions and/or by supporting the establishment of new bodies. The project will continue supporting the reactivation of the Libyan Credit Guarantee fund which was previously carried by SLEIDSE project along with developing new financial tools that had not previously existed within the Libyan market. In order to achieve the optimum results, the CBL, commercial banks, sovereign funds, etc. will be directly involved.

The overall objective of the action is to improve Libya's business environment, in order to generate economic growth for private sector and job opportunities for youth and in particular for women.

The aim of the component 2 is to organise and make operational a broad network of entrepreneurship-supporting organisations all over the country. This is expected to create a powerful network of actors and instruments that can be operational quickly.

Expertise France and the Ministry of Planning aim is to build and/or enhance capacities and visibility of CSOs dealing with youth and women empowerment.

The purpose of the present call for proposal is to identify Libyan CSO's with thematic specialisation and capacity to support women and youth's economic empowerment.

The mission will be, among others, to help women entrepreneurs to:

By being supported by CSOs, women-entrepreneurs will be able to rely on practical advice and collective help from their network. That will help them to successfully develop their business.

Seed funds will be given through the selected CSOs to Libyan female entrepreneurs.

The objective is to help women to develop their business, make investments, increase their productivity and profitability. At the end the business must be developed, sustainable and make profit.

The different types of activities eligible for financial support are handcrafted activities, trading activities, food and catering activities, agriculture activities, IT activities.

The third parties will be co-selected by Expertise France and the selected CSO based on their business plan/ideas and on their capacities to develop it.

The criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support for each third entity will be the business plan proposed by the entrepreneur.

The maximum amount of financial support that can be paid must not exceed  5 000 per third party.

In cooperation with Libyan universities, each CSO will implement and organize an entrepreneurship bootcamp (6 days of intensive training), to train 24 university students on business plans writing.

Then based on their business plan, entrepreneurs with best ideas will be trained on pitching skills to patriciate in a nation-wide business contest.

Both output 1 and output 2 will be annual activities for the next 3 years.

Given the crisis in Libya, the financing of the action in full is authorized.

5.1 For CSOs

The maximum amount to implement the activities will be  60, 000 (split in 3, 20,000 for the first year and  20 000 every year for 2 years) this budget should cover:

5.2 Support to third parties - female entrepreneurs (through the CSOs)

12 different women entrepreneurs who were able to initially start their business, will receive each year (over 3 years)  5 000.

The selection process is subject to strict eligibility criteria

Eight NGOs have legally challenged the French government's decision to donate six boats to the Libyan Navy, which includes the Libyan Coast Guard.

Amnesty International is one of eight NGOs demanding that delivery of the boats is suspended, believing they would be used to intercept refugees and migrants and force them back to Libya, where they suffer serious human rights violations.

Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International's Regional Director for Research, said:

""Delivering boats to the Libyan Coast Guard was an unlawful and reckless decision - but doing it now, as the armed conflict in Libya escalates, is even more callous and irresponsible.

""The donation would make French authorities complicit in trapping thousands of women, men and children in a country where they suffer extortion and are arbitrarily detained and tortured.

""Instead of supporting Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, France and other European governments must ensure safe routes for those fleeing violence and abuse in Libya and call for the Libyan authorities to immediate release all migrants and refugees from horrific detention centres.""

He added that the donation would violate the European embargo on Libya, related to the supply of military equipment, as well as the Arms Trade Treaty prohibition of arms transfers to countries where they could be used to commit or facilitate atrocities.

The donation of the six boats was announced by the French Defence Minister in February. Amnesty, Médecins Sans Frontières France, Groupe d'information et de soutien des immigrés, Ligue des droits de l'Homme, La Cimade, Avocats sans Frontieres, Associazione Studi Giuridici Immigrazione and Migreurop are all involved in the legal challenge against this decision.

Finally, the United Nations' special envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame announced the dates and venue for his long-awaited Libyan National Conference (LNC). It is now scheduled to take place from 14-16 April in the Libyan south-western town of Ghadames. A historical town which once was a tourist attraction in stable and peaceful Libya.

Salame first presented the LNC as part of a three-step roadmap and had it endorsed by the UN Security Council in September 2017. The roadmap aimed first at amending the Libyan Political Accord (LPA) signed in Morocco in December 2015, second to organising an inter Libyan dialogue to reconcile Libyans and encourage them to find a solution to their country's problem. And finally to organising both legislative and presidential elections based on a new constitution and a new election law.

After six rounds of negotiations, the UN gave up in the summer of 2018 on amending the LPA because the parliament and Higher Council of State, the two main protagonists, refused to compromise. Elections did not take place, as originally hoped, in the spring of last year. Even the draft constitution is still up in the air as it faces legal challenges before it is put into referendum to be adopted. At one point everything seemed like it was collapsing around Salame!

Ghassan Salame was left with no option but to play his last card; organising the LNC which he announced in a press conference in Tripoli on 20 March right after briefing the Security Council and getting its backing.

Now the stage is set for LNC to take place in less than three weeks but logistical and legal questions remain unanswered.

But what is this conference and how successful will it be? Simply said the meeting, sometimes referred to as a Forum (Multaqa in Arabic), is an inclusive Libyan meeting tasked with bringing together the widest possible Libyan social, political, tribal and civic representatives to discuss, for two days, and recommend ways to get out of the division and conflict. Libya has been plunged in chaos and conflict since NATO helped rebels topple the late Gaddafi regime in October 2011 after a bloody eight-month war.

Salame said between 120 and 150 individuals would take part in the Forum, without disclosing how the participants would be chosen. Based on the prevailing political and military situation on the ground it is easy to guess who will take part.

Representatives of the current centres of power in the country, both legal and otherwise, will surely be invited. This means the national army led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, now controlling nearly two-thirds of Libya, is going to be invited and representatives of the eastern-based parliament in Tripoli; the Government of National Accord, and some representatives of the militias allied to it are surely on the list of invitees. Tribal and civil society leaders will also be included.

The hope is that such a mix would produce a broad document, in the form of recommendations, supported by the ""majority of Libyans"" to constitute a new roadmap ending with elections. An agreement which as the backing of a large swathe of society.

Many have questioned whether the two-day conference is long enough for such a consensus to be reached. While others have pointed out that Ghadames, which is over 600 kilometres from Tripoli, has insufficient infrastructure to accommodate the number of representatives arriving and support the meeting.

The UN envoy has however been carrying work in preparation for the Forum; the consultation phase was outsourced to the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue; a Swiss think-tank with long experience in conflict zones from Sri Lanka to Mali. The centre held some 77 meetings across Libya in the spring and summer of 2018 and received hundreds of messages and recommendations from Libyans inside the country and abroad. All contributions were produced in a summarised 80 pages document. The LNC's discussions will be based on this document.

This gives a huge boost to the process making it an exclusively Libyan affair. Many politicians, academics, activists and tribal leaders have been blaming the failure to reach a political settlement in Libya on foreign interferences.

While the LNC is not expected to produce a government nor will it work as a legislative, replacing the current parliament, some MPs are suspicious that it could end up being a de facto parliament. Salame was clear in his press conference about this particular point when he said: ""[The conference] is not another institution but a conference and will not add new institutions to existing ones."" Hopefully an effort to re-assure current holders of political position that they will only be challenged through the ballot boxes.

If successful, the LNC is expected to bring about national reconciliation, set election dates, guarantee election results and recommend the way forward for the elected government. Most importantly it is expected to provide a safety net for the coming elections.

The most recent similar conference, helped by the UN, is the Loya Jirga in Afghanistan which approved Hamid Karazi as president along with his cabinet in 2002 and worked as guarantor of elections in the country.

However, the LNC is not supposed to re-produce the Afghan model, as that will mean infringing on the elected parliament's duties, except in the sense of reaching the broadest consensus among Libyans about the solution they envision for their country.

According to Salame: ""The main aim is that LNC is to agree on elections,"" which has been the demand of the overwhelming majority of Libyans according to the UN envoy.

""The conference will succeed,"" he stressed. ""The broad consensus of Libyan opinions will make it difficult for any country or countries to intervene."" Furthermore, such ""broad consensus will get the support of the international community,"" Salame said.

Tobruk parliamentarian explains south Libya's support for Hifter

The Libyan National Army (LNA) led by Gen. Khalifa Hifter launched a military campaign in the Libyan south on Jan. 15 to secure oil fields and eliminate criminal gangs.

On March 2, the LNA announced it had taken full control of southern Libya after taking several cities and oil fields like El-Sharara and El-Feel. The moves angered the rival Presidential Council of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli. Chairman of the GNA's Presidential Council Fayez al-Sarraj accused the LNA of seeking political gains by expanding its area of control.

11399439,2019-11-19,"Seven and half months into the conflict in Libya, and given the recent dangerous escalation in the hostilities in and around Tripoli, we find ourselves ever more in a race against time to reach a peaceful solution that would spare many lives. I will provide you with an update on the security situation before turning to political developments.

I am angry and sad to report to you that today there was another mass civilian casualty event. A biscuit factory in the Wadi Rabi'a neighbourhood of Tripoli was hit by an air strike, according to early information. The attack has caused what we currently believe to be ten fatalities and over 35 injuries. It appears that the majority of the dead were migrants, but that at least two were Libyans. Regardless of whether the attack deliberately targeted the factory or was an indiscriminate attack, it may constitute a war crime. We are working to verify the facts and will update you accordingly.

Beyond today's tragedy, the frontlines in Southern Tripoli are highly fluid. The dangers and direct consequences of foreign interference are increasingly evident. To fill gaps in manpower, there is growing involvement of mercenaries and fighters from foreign private military companies. The insertion of these experienced fighters has naturally led to an intensification in the violence. I am gravely worried by the expansion of artillery fire northwards into the city. Over the past days, the number of civilians killed and injured has been rising and many families are leaving the areas impacted by the shelling. A further escalation of ground fighting in these densely populated areas would lead to disastrous humanitarian consequences.

The use of air power and precision technology has become a dominant feature of an otherwise low intensity conflict. UNSMIL estimates the total number of drone strikes in support of Libyan National Army forces at well above 800 since the beginning of the conflict. The total number of drone strikes in support of the Government of National Accord is estimated at around 240. It is our judgement that the drone infrastructure and operations are facilitated by external parties to the conflict. There were also several incidents of precision airstrikes conducted by unknown aircraft between September and November. In addition, the increasing use of unguided bombs in airstrikes conducted by LNA forces in populated areas of Tripoli caused an increase in the number of civilian casualties.

The violence is facilitated by Libya's plethora of Gadhafi-era arms, as well as by continued shipments of war materiel brought into the country in breach of the arms embargo. Reports indicate that everything from spare parts for fighter aircraft to tanks, from bullets to precision missiles, are being brought into Libya in support of different groups involved in the fighting.

Mitiga Airport remains closed. It has been more than two and a half months now that this key outlet for the civilian population of Tripoli and Western Libya has been forced to shut due to indiscriminate shelling and airstrikes. Misrata airport, a small mixed civilian-military facility located 250 km east of Tripoli, is now the only exit-point for Libyans in the West of the country -- who comprise the majority of the country's population -- to travel abroad by air. Misrata Airport too has been targeted at least 11 times by precision airstrikes since early September.

Mitiga Airport needs to reopen as soon as possible. Together with the GNA Ministers of Interior and Transportation, I am working on a number of practical steps to achieve this goal, including the clear delineation between the civilian and military sections of the airport, as well as the establishment of a dedicated UN terminal.

Mr. President,

I am determined to see the end of this debilitating conflict. My colleagues at UNSMIL and I are fully engaged and have been working tirelessly with Libyans and international partners to prepare for the Second and Third Steps of the initiative I announced on 29 July.

I would like to thank the Government of Germany for their work in preparing for an international summit. Three Senior Official Meetings have already taken place and there will be a crucial fourth meeting this Wednesday, on 20 November. In the last discussion on 21 October, participants worked to agree on a draft communique that outlines six baskets of activities necessary to end the conflict in Libya. These six baskets include the need for the return to the Libyan-led political process and accompanying economic reform; a ceasefire, implementation of the arms embargo and security reform; as well as the upholding of international human rights and humanitarian law. Putting implementation of the arms embargo at the heart of international commitment is essential in practical terms and as a message to the Libyan people.

UNSMIL has worked to substantiate an Operational Annex to the draft communique. The annex has two purposes. It serves to outline the commitments of the members of the Berlin Group to ending the conflict and advancing the political process through tangible actions, benchmarked by indicators and outlining responsibility for those actions. It also serves as the ""bridge"" to the intra-Libyan political dialogue, which will be launched under UN auspices immediately following the Berlin Summit.

One of the tangible outcomes of the international summit would be the establishment of a follow-up committee that would work with UNSMIL to implement the outcomes agreed in the final communique. Such a committee would play a fundamental role in terms of ensuring respect for a ceasefire and better implementation of the arms embargo. It would contribute to supporting a return to the political process, implementation of agreed economic and financial reforms, practical ways and means to ensure no impunity for violations of IHL. The committee would also support the necessary DDR process for groups across the country.

I have been actively engaged with member states on a bilateral basis. I was in particular grateful for the visit to Libya of German Foreign Minister Maas to brief Prime Minister Serraj on the Berlin process on 27 October. Last week, I travelled to Cairo for very positive meetings with Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry and other high-level officials. International unity and agreement are essential to stop the violence and pursue resolution of the crisis through political dialogue. I have high hopes that the Berlin process will end in success. Let me stress once more that endorsement of the Berlin Communique does not mean the end of the process, but rather the beginning of the most important part of our journey to put Libya back on the path to peace and stability.

In support of the Berlin process, I have engaged extensively with Prime Minister Serraj, and the commanders of the Government of National Accord forces and I have also met with General Haftar and politicians who support him. There is a scope for agreement on ending the conflict and the basis for returning to the political process.

UNSMIL has also engaged in extensive outreach to Libyan constituencies, including in the diaspora. These meetings have involved commanders of units engaged in the fighting, their civilian representatives and political constituencies from across the country. The anger and frustration at the conflict and the strong desire for it to end emerged clearly from these discussions.

I am pleased to report that efforts continue to support the political process. The Egyptian government has been working with members of the House of Representative to try to unify the body, as a group of Western members continues to meet independently in Tripoli. We are in permanent contact with the various factions in the House of Representatives encouraging them to maintain their assembly's integrity. Partner organisations have also held second track consultations where participants have emphasised again their desire for peaceful resolution to the conflict and proposed ideas for a way forward. These are all positive developments, reflecting a will and a commitment to ending the conflict and returning to the political track to end the crisis in the country.

Mr. President,

In parallel with our efforts at a national level, work continues directly with Libyan communities. To address the polarisation in the country, we have now hosted two workshops to stem incitement and the use of hateful rhetoric in the media. The workshops brought together journalists, editors and social media activists with instructors in human rights and representatives of social media platforms. Our ultimate goal is to conclude a Code of Conduct for the media in Libya.

At a grassroots level, we held the last in a series of three events in mid-October to support local mediators. Over 120 Libyans, including 23 women, have attended these meetings which aim to establish a national network of mediators which will include tribal leaders, elders, representatives of civil society, youth and women activists, academics and businesspeople, who enjoy credibility and respect amongst their various constituencies.

Municipal elections remain on hold following a June court ruling that cancelled the electoral regulation administering the elections. It is a positive reflection of the democratic spirit in Libya that many mayors are nevertheless requesting to renew the expired mandate of their Councils through elections. I recently met with the chairperson of the Central Committee for Municipal Council Elections who assured me of the readiness of the committee to resume municipal elections once the legal basis is restored. On 4 November the Sebha Court of First Instance validated the results of the municipal elections in Sabha, that took place in 27 April. While another legal challenge against the results remains pending, and, the petitioners' announcement that the validation ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court, this is nevertheless a welcome and important development for the largest city in Southern Libya.

In Sirte, UN agencies launched a project to support youth and adolescents to become active agents of change and peace. This is a welcome first effort to implement UNSCR 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security in the Libyan context.

Mr. President,

Let me take this opportunity to raise once again the case of Seham Serghewa, the member of the House of Representatives abducted from her home on 17 July. For over four months, authorities in the East have been unable to produce information about the fate of this woman legislator and outspoken rights activist.

Ms. Serghewa's fate is part of a larger pattern of violence against women across the country. The Mission is documenting instances of killing and forced disappearances, including, on 16 October, the case of a 70-year-old Libyan woman abducted from her home in Benghazi after she was accused of practicing witchcraft. In addition, women migrants and refugees in Libya are at risk of rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and forced prostitution in detention and at large.

On a positive note, I am pleased to report that Libyan women were recognised for their peacebuilding efforts. On 16 October, the BBC named Ms. Reda Al-Tabuly - who you will have a chance to hear from today and who is a peace campaigner and the chairwoman of Together We Build It Organization -- as one of the 100 most influential women for 2019.

Mr. President,

In Tripoli, the effects of the conflict continue to impact the civilian population. More than 200 civilians have been killed and more than 128,000 people have fled their homes since the conflict began on 4 April. More than 135,000 civilians remain in frontline areas, and an additional 270,000 people live in areas directly affected by conflict.

Since the beginning of 2019, violence in Libya has had a devastating impact on health care in the country with 60 attacks against health care facilities, medical personnel, and ambulances registered. We have observed a clear pattern of precision airstrikes targeting the medical facilities of Government of National Accord forces. Intentionally directing attacks against medical facilities and personnel, wilful killing or harming of sick or wounded people may constitute war crimes.

Migrants and refugees continue to be at risk of unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and unlawful deprivation of liberty, rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, slavery and forced labour, extortion and exploitation. Serious concerns also continue with regard to the transfer of migrants intercepted at sea by the Libyan Coast Guard to official and unofficial detention centres including to Zawiya Detention Centre and the Tajoura Detention Centre, that the authorities reported on 1 August 2019 was to be closed.

A health sector assessment conducted in October 2019 revealed a sharp increase in unmet health needs, particularly for women and girls. More than 24% of health facilities are closed due to the conflict, electricity cuts or structural damage, and services are interrupted in many other health facilities. Children are unable to reach schools, dozens of which have been destroyed. Nearly 30 more schools are being used as shelters for displaced persons.

The United Nations and its humanitarian partners have reached over 310,000 people with humanitarian assistance this year. Unfortunately, humanitarian needs exceed the means at our disposal. To date, less than half of the appeal for USD 202 million under the Libya Humanitarian Response Plan has been funded. I encourage donors to help us shrink the funding gap.

In southern Libya, the UN country team continues to support the Ahali population displaced from Murzuq, very few of whom have returned to their homes. UNSMIL has continued to meet with Ahali and Tebu leaders to resolve the underlying grievances between the communities and enable the safe and dignified return of the Ahali population.

Mr. President,

I regret to inform you that there are no new developments in my appeal for more information regarding the 10 August attack which killed three UN staff members and severely injured two others. A Board of Inquiry sent from Headquarters arrived some days ago and I call on all Libyan parties to cooperate positively with this body. Our two injured staff members continue to recover. We are committed to remaining in Libya to serve the Libyan people.

Mr. President,

It is somewhat of a cliché to say that the weeks ahead are critical - but once again, it is true for Libya. External investment in the conflict risks surpassing the amount of national involvement, taking control of Libya's future away from the Libyans and putting it in the hands of foreign parties. Once invited in, foreign intervention is the guest that settles and seizes control of the house.

It is in the interests of all Libyans to reject outside interference in their country's affairs, and I look to them for their support in calling for external actors to adhere to the arms embargo and commit tangibly to ending the conflict on the ground, before it's too late.

Ending the conflict and agreeing to the way forward is a realistic prospect. The parties are known. The outlines of the agreement are known. Options for a temporary or longer-term constitutional framework exist. Electoral legislation has been produced before. It is all eminently possible. All that is needed now is for you, the international community, to come together to provide the necessary umbrella for the Libyan parties themselves to join hands to end the conflict and resume dialogue. The United Nations is in Libya, and will remain in Libya, to support the Libyan people on their journey.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Berlin', 'Tripoli', 'Libya', 'East Germany', 'Misrata', 'Cairo', 'Egypt', 'Germany', 'Zawiya, Libya', 'Sabha, Libya', 'Sirte', 'Tajura', 'Benghazi']",Salame Briefing to the UN Security Council,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2019/11/18/salame-briefing-to-the-un-security-council/,None,

The University of Tripoli, in collaboration with the National Center of Animal Health of the Libyan Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Marine Resources, organized in March in Benghazi a three-day training workshop targeting Animal Health officers from Benghazi, al-Marj, Al-Abyar, Suluq, Qaminis, Ajdabiya and Zella. The workshop aimed at building the capacity of veterinarians in detecting these diseases, determining their amplitude and fighting them, in addition to good emergency practices management and communication on Animal Health.

Another similar workshop was organized earlier in Tripoli, with participants from Animal Health offices in Tripoli, Zawiya, Sorman, Sabratha, Al-Ajaylat, Jumail, Zuwarah, Janzour, Jafara, Qasr Bin- Ghashir, Tajura, Tarhuna, Msallata and Khoms.

Zakaria Alkhattal, the director general of the National Center of Animal Health, said that these workshops are part of the ongoing training program targeting five regions in Libya (Benghazi, Derna, Sirte, Sabha and Tripoli), in the framework of the collaboration with FAO, with the aim of training 80 veterinarians and veterinary assistants. Five awareness workshops are planned to host 30 veterinarians, who will be expected to organize awareness sessions to other veterinarians, farmers and consumers.

It is expected that these awareness sessions on zoonotic diseases would reach 5000 people. Trainees will be executing preventive vaccination to dogs against rabies, and conduct field surveys on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), and Rift Valley fever, in order to achieve effective surveillance and control of zoonotic diseases for protecting humans and animals. As a result of these surveys, 20 veterinarians will be trained on conducting specialized tests, analyzing samples and interpreting results.

Early in April, armed groups of warlord Khalifa Haftar seized the mountain city of Gharyan without a gunshot after the city's militia leader Adel Da'ab decided to join them.

Haftar's armed groups, with the help of French and Emirati military experts, set up a military operation room in Gharyan to conquer Tripoli. Shortly after Gharyan seizure, a group of 13 French armed intelligence officers were intercepted by Tunisian authorities at the border with Libya. Tunisian media reports suggested that the French officers may have assisted Haftar's forces to set up the operation room.

But things didn't work out as they planned. On July 26, government forces retook Gharyan after over three months of seizure, in a big blow to warlord Haftar and his foreign allies.

Presidential Council forces took control of the city in a surprise 7-hour attack and arrested over a hundred local fighters and foreign mercenaries. They also seized the operation room set up by Haftar and his foreign allies, in addition to a number of futuristic weapons, including US-made Javelin missiles.

While accusations for the fire-and-forget missile supply were directed at the UAE, one of the key backers, US officials concluded that the missiles were first sold to France before ending up in the hands of warlord Haftar's armed groups.

Feeling embarrassed, France admitted that the Javelin missiles found in Gharyan were purchased from the United States, but it claimed that ""the missiles were never intended for sale or transfer to any party to the Libya conflict.""

In a statement, it added that the missiles were ""damaged and unusable"" and were intended for the ""self-protection of a French military unit deployed to carry out counter-terrorism operations"".

France's narrative was deemed inaccurate and full of contradictions by many observers and politicians.

Presidential Council member, Mohammad Amari Zayed said France's statement on the presence of its missiles in Gharyan is contradictory. From one side the statement claimed the missiles were ""damaged and unusable"" but on the other side, it claimed the missiles were for self-protection and fighting terrorism.

So how can one fight terrorism with damaged and unusable weapons? Amari argues.

Anas El Gomati, Director of Libyan think tank Sadeq Institute said France's presence in Gharyan proves that it knew about Haftar's offensive on Tripoli and supported it despite its claims of support to Tripoli-based Presidential Council. El Gomati said France was lying about its weapons supply to Haftar to topple the Presidential Council.

Ahmed Sewehli, a Libyan democracy advocate, thinks France is at war with Libya, accusing it of mass murdering Libyan people with their sophisticated weapons supply to Haftar.

France's support to Haftar goes back to 2014 during his war on Benghazi. A French military operation room was set up to help Haftar's forces take control of the city on the pretext of fighting terrorism.

In July 2016, three French special forces soldiers were killed when their helicopter was shot down in El Magrun town, about 75 km south of Benghazi, during a military operation to Back Haftar's forces. Benghazi Defence Brigades claimed responsibility for the shoot-down, but France claimed the helicopter crash was accidental.

France's link to the fight against ISIS has raised eyebrows. During Al-Bonyan Al-Marsous war on ISIS in Sirte in 2016, a French submarine approached the coast in an attempt to evacuate ""important persons"" as the war on the terror group was raging.

Speaking to The Libya Observer on condition of anonymity, a high-profile state security officer revealed that Libyan Navy forces had detected a submarine sailing near the coast and sent a request for the call sign. The crew of the submarine identified themselves as US marine forces conducting some operations before vanishing. Later US Africa Command denied the presence of any US submarines near the coast at the time after a request for clarification sent by the Presidential Council.

The Libyan Navy concluded that the submarine belonged to the French Navy and it was attempting to help some ""important persons"" flee from Sirte, according to the state security officer.

Some reports claimed that France was trying to evacuate some ISIS leaders who were working for French intelligence.

Communication between Libyan Navy and French Navy impersonating US Marines

The security officer also disclosed that a French intelligence officer (photo here) visited Watiya airbase in western Libya near the border with Tunisia immediately after the February revolution that overthrew Gaddafi's regime. The French officer inspected the airbase with the aim to set up a French presence near the Tunisian border, but their goal was derailed after French requests to visit the airbase again were rejected by the Libyan authorities at the time.

The French might have wanted to facilitate the flow of Tunisian terrorists into Libya, the Libyan state security officer thinks.

Before the battle of Sirte, an ISIS convoy escaped from Benghazi to the central region of Libya without being intercepted by Haftar's forces. Former spokesperson of Dignity Operation Mohammed Al-Hijazi said in an interview with a local TV station that the ISIS convoy escaped from Benghazi under an air cover from a foreign backer to Haftar, without mentioning it.

Economic researcher in the oil and gas industry

Libya is a huge country with considerable petroleum resources and marginally small population. Since the discovery of oil in 1959, the North African country strives to improve its economic position in the region and to better its petroleum industry. From the start of Libyan production, Libya pioneered in many petroleum industry indicators such as first LNG producers, largest reserve holders in Africa.

Major and international oil companies very much enjoyed early era of Libyan petroleum contracts (concessionary contracts) that allowed them control of the production of oil from the Libyan kingdom petroleum field, Libya produced as much as 3.5 million barrel of oil in 1970.

New Libyan government came to power in 1969 after toppling the Libyan king which followed by subsidizing the petroleum industry in the 1971 and abolished previous petroleum contracts. Again Libya was pioneer as first OPEC member to introduce production sharing contract PSC which forced all major oil companies to embrace it, in a step by the Libyan government to regain control of Libyan petroleum resources and production. Soon after that Libya's production figures indicated a sharp decline of Libyan petroleum production due to U.S. government eagerness to tame the north African leader through imposing sanctions and boycotting almost all U.S. petroleum developing activity in Libya.

The tension reached its peak in 1986 after the USA bombed the two Libyan cities; Tripoli and Benghazi, oil production at that time was around 1.1 million barrel per day. Few but sizable petroleum discovery were made that boost Libya's petroleum reserved which, made Libya once more the hottest spot for oil exploration during the 1990s and 2000s. Few problems have to be solved politically before the U.S. government lifted its sanctions and allow their mighty petroleum companies enter to Libyan petroleum fields in late 2004.

Libya invited all petroleum company to participate in the first and second round of petroleum contracts knowing locally as EPSA VI. Between both rounds, a total of 47 EPSA VI contract were signed. The result was outstanding economically for the Libyan national oil company (LNOC), after publishing the results, many skeptics questioned the seriousness of the signed major oil companies. 27 EPSA VI contracts gave the LNOC 88% production Share of any oil discovered, eight of them between 88% to 80% for Libya, the rest not less than 70% in 2008. Negotiation rounds were a huge success for the Libyan NOC and its administration. Few major oil companies announced sizable petroleum discovery in number of wildcat well drilled during 2010, a promising future was awaiting the North Africa nation, but the industry luck just run out.

Libya engulfed and still have in eight years of civil war since 2011. All major petroleum companies ceased their activities and moved out of Libya at the beginning of Libyan escalation. Many Libyan governments after Gaddafi failed to hold a grip on the fast country, the division still widely speared with no light at the end of the Libyan tunnel are seen yet. Major oil companies are not obliged legally to the previous Libyan contracts since LNOC declared force majeure many times since 2011.

Attempts to motivate them to start petroleum activities failed, with an indication of LNOC vulnerability is perceived by oil players in the international oil markets. In 2018 Libyan National Oil Company allowed the sale of U.S. Marathon Oil 16.333% stack of Libya's Waha concession for 450 million US dollar to French Total, although LNOC should and could have bought it and increase its control of the Waha concession, not doing that many critics questioned LNOC credibility of protecting Libyan petroleum interest. Before that in the middle of 2017, the U.N. backed government in Tripoli tried to side with German's Wintershall oil company by allowing them to convert their concession contract to EPSA IV contract only for LNOC to oppose such move. Libyan NOC is currently vulnerable without a strong and unified Libyan government. Current effort to entice international company to come to Libya will not work, LNOC should concentrate heavily on improving its scattered oil fields which in constant need for technical and financial attention, and many of which will cease their productions activities imminently.

Libya's eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar commented on his offensive to capture the capital, the future of oil exports and attempts to end the nation's crisis peacefully in written answers to questions sent by Bloomberg News.

Following is the full transcript of the interview:

Bloomberg: Will the army's command continue to secure oil fields against any acts of sabotage and calls for production to stop?

Field Marshal Haftar: The national army's soldiers and officers have sacrificed their lives to liberate and protect oil ports, so how would we allow any sabotage? The wealth and institutions of Libyans will be protected with our lives, there is no question about it. The Libyan National Army has proved in all of the battles how extremely careful it's been to ensure the security of oil installations and not interfere in running them. The Libyan people know this well.

Whoever is seeking to sabotage the installations and hurt the livelihood of Libyans will be dealt with severely and the army will stand in their way. This is our patriotic duty and we're well aware of its weight and it's not up for negotiations.

Bloomberg: The head of the National Oil Corp. accuses the army of using oil airports for military purposes, what's your answer?

Haftar: I am answering you, not him. We didn't need the oil airports so we didn't use them for the military so far. But if we need to -- and it's unlikely -- we won't hesitate. We are in a state of general mobilization and all of the state's capabilities are at the disposal of the armed forces.

Bloomberg: Do you have any role in trying to convince OPEC or the United Nations to export oil through the national company based in Benghazi under the supervision of the army?

Haftar: This is not a matter for the army. More importantly, the national company should live up to its name, working only for the benefit of Libyans, not under the control of any hegemony or foreign interventions, and for it to be devoid of any appearance of corruption. The company should not avail its capabilities to the service of terrorists and armed militias, and to avoid working against the army. It should only carry out the role mandated by law with all honesty. It should be accountable and under supervision. This is the basis of the oil sector. Anything else is just appearances.

Oil is a vital sector that touches the livelihoods of Libyans. Its proceeds should be distributed through a just system that can benefit all Libyans equally. Manipulating it or using it for political purposes to serve certain parties is a violation that can't be left unanswered. This is a public-sector company owned by all Libyans. It's not a private company.

Bloomberg: There was talk about the army selling oil illegally before. Did you do this?

Haftar: The army is not a trader. The army is a regular defense force protecting the homeland. It doesn't sell oil, neither legally or illegally. Selling oil is exclusively the work of the National Oil Corp., which the army addressed to take up its responsibilities in running and operating the ports and exporting oil in the same statement that we announced liberating the oil ports in September 2016 from criminal, terrorist gangs who were blocking its export and smuggling it for their own private benefit.

The main issue about oil is the just distribution of its proceeds equally among Libyans. It should not be employed to support terrorist organizations and armed militias. The oil sector should also be devoid of any corruption. This is where the attention should be.

The selling of oil is governed by laws and legislation.

Bloomberg: Has pulling out of Gharyan affected the army's operations to move toward the capital?

Haftar: Advancing toward the capital is based on a comprehensive military operation and doesn't rely on one certain positioning.

Pulling out of certain positions -- regardless of the reason -- is in our military calculations from the beginning. A military withdrawal is part of fighting and an essential component of the plan of any battle. It doesn't affect the entire operation because it's part of military planning to begin with. The leadership that doesn't put withdrawal under its consideration, and doesn't plan for it for an emergency or to reinforce the positions of its forces and re-organize them or any other reason, is a failed leadership par excellence.

A withdrawal doesn't at all mean losing and it doesn't mean backing away from achieving the target of the battle. The army that doesn't know how to pull back has nothing but defeat. Advancing toward the capital is first and foremost subject to the safety of citizens, their property and possessions and the city's institutions. It's not subject to a technical withdrawal from one position to the other.

This is what we have as our top priority, and will be clear to you when when orders are given to advance toward the heart of the capital and control it. This will happen soon, God willing.

Bloomberg: Media reports suggested that Tripoli's General National Accord forces found U.S.-made weapons and ammunition in your positions in Gharyan. How do you respond to this?

Haftar: This is nonsense. We don't own any American weapons and we didn't strike any weapons deal with the United States, and the entire world knows that the United States is one of the strictest countries in imposing the arms embargo so how can it be believed that it's exporting weapons to us.

Even the countries that buy weapons from the United States can never give it to us because they will come under international condemnation and it will harm their ties with the U.S. In addition, the Libyan army hasn't received any training on U.S.-made weapons even under the previous regime. So how can we get American weapons? These militias think they will achieve victories with these claims and harm us, while we achieve victories in the field and not through telling lies in the media.

Bloomberg: What does the army's command say about Turkey's threat to target your forces?

Haftar: I don't follow what Turkey's foreign minister says because our time is precious, and our people are waiting for the announcement that Tripoli has been liberated from terrorism. We are going ahead with our struggle regardless of any political statements here and there. What we care about is our relationship with the Turkish people, and we respect them. And in any case, if this was true, the interim government has a foreign ministry that can answer if deemed necessary. We won't respond through the media.

Bloomberg: It's been 80 days since the army's advance toward Tripoli and still the fighting is at the outskirts of the capital. What's delaying the army's advance and do you have a plan to do so soon? Do you have a time frame for the operation?

Haftar: Many people superficially say that the national army was relying in its plan on liberating the capital in days or hours but failed to do so. This is nonsense that can only come from someone who is ignorant and doesn't understand the lessons presented by the national army in military planning. We all understand the situation in Tripoli from all sides and we know the positions of the terrorist groups, their leaderships, movements and communications, their ammunition depots, backup, fighting capabilities and other accurate information using our professional intelligence-gathering methods.

We also understand the great precautions needed to ensure the safety of innocent civilians first, and for the city's institutions and installation to avoid destruction. If we didn't put this into consideration we would have been done with a sudden storming of the capital in less than 24 hours. We take these precautions out of patriotic duty and not in response to any pressure because the operation itself is to protect the citizens, their freedom and dignity. We can't accept for the citizens to become the victims. You won't find anyone more careful about this than the national army.

The various forces of terrorism and the armed militias didn't spring up overnight to be wiped out in hours. They took years to form, expand their influence and tighten their grip on the capital, in addition to bringing in weapons and money, setting up ties with countries that support terrorism and recruit unemployed youths through money.

The main element in the spreading of these groups is the slowness and the deliberate delay in reaching a peaceful political solution in order to safeguard the interests of those who are benefiting from the status quo. The longer the delay, the more that these groups will spread.

The armed forces have, since the announcement of the liberation operation, offered them a peaceful solution that ensures their safety by dropping their weapons and letting our forces enter the city without a fight. But they preferred confrontation and bloodshed. The choice of war was theirs, which necessitates the liberation of the capital by force. However, the peaceful choice is still on the table for them to surrender their weapons before it's too late.

Tripoli is the capital of all Libyans and includes the main state institutions. A state cannot rise when its capital is ruled by militias with medium and heavy weapons, where terrorist leaders hide in its neighborhoods. This is something nobody can disagree with. The city has to be liberated and the army is the only institution that is qualified and ready for this.

The time of the liberation is coming soon to announce an era that Libyans are waiting for.

Bloomberg: Is there any time left for negotiations with the GNA? Any contacts through mediators to reach a settlement?

Haftar: What we are doing now is a patriotic duty that has nothing to do with the so-called GNA. There is nothing to negotiate with them about. In reality, the GNA -- starting with its head -- is nothing but a mouthpiece for the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood organization and its armed militias, and a soft tool in their hands, does what it's ordered to do.

This is the truth that all Libyans know from the start and the world now knows. What the national army is doing is the continuation of a comprehensive liberation and not against any political process or societal dialogue: it's specifically against terrorists and armed groups that have kidnapped the capital with all its political and economic institutions, and started to terrorize the people and blackmail them by force. They're standing against the creation of a state and the transition to a period of security, stability and development.

We don't see any need for mediation with what you call the GNA because it's outside what we do and it's not the target of our military operation. Any in any case, it's been proven from experience that it can't commit to any pledge without taking the permission of the Muslim Brotherhood and the militias. This is a fact that everyone knows.

Bloomberg: What's your comment on Fayez Al-Sarraj's initiative?

Haftar: Unfortunately, the man can only say what he's told to say. The decision isn't his to make. It's all echo that doesn't deserve to be answered because our time is precious. Our attention is now focused on liberating the capital as soon as possible and with minimum losses, and then for the post-liberation phase.

At the same time, we don't oppose any political solution to resolve the crisis. Let the politicians present their peaceful initiative and with it disarm the militias of the tank and the missile and the rifle. We would be the first to support this. It would be great no doubt, because it will spare us the need to fight and its tragedies. We would announce then a ceasefire immediately.

But the comic initiatives aimed for media attention, to gain time and give the fake impression that it's for peace and the stemming of bloodshed -- they die at their birth.

Bloomberg: In Al-Sarraj's initiative, he mentions that it's aimed at those who are against the militarization of the state. Is this a hint at your desire to militarize the state?

Haftar: Since the launch of Operation Dignity in 2014 our military goals haven't changed: eradicating terrorism, regaining sovereign control and security in the country. And before all this, to preserve the citizen's dignity. The shape of the state and how it's governed, this is something for Libyans to decide by their free will.

Our role is to eliminate the obstacles facing the people and pave the way for them to be the decision makers. The armed forces can't impose its will on Libyans. The opposite is true. And I am certain that Libyans mock the phrase you mentioned because they appreciate the role of their army in restoring the homeland and freeing it from terrorism. They also appreciate the sacrifices made. Libya didn't suffer in its history since independence more than it did under the militias, the Muslim Brotherhood and the terrorists.

Libya at the end of the day will be, God willing, a free, civil and sovereign state according to what the Libyans decide. The most precious element of the state is the citizen who enjoys all of his constitutional rights without oppression.

The Libyans' wealth will be for them to spend on building their present, future and the future of next generations. Anyone who committed a crime against the Libyans will be dealt with only by the justice system the day when the state rises and victory is declared.

As for convening meetings, the army has never intervened or stopped this before.

Bloomberg: How do the U.S. and Russia as well as Arab states view the army's advance toward the capital?

Haftar: The entire world has recognized the nature of the groups that the army is fighting at the outskirts of the capital, and not just the United States and Russia. The entire world has believed that security and stability in Libya and its surrounding areas can't be achieved as long as these armed groups are carrying weapons and imposing their influence over every institution in the capital.

The thing that some countries fear the most is for the oil sector to be affected by military operations. Reality has proven that these fears are unfounded. Some neighboring countries fear that the military operations would lead terrorists to flee to their territories. To eliminate those fears, we are working to enhance joint security work to monitor the terrorists' moves across the borders.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'United States', 'Libya', 'Gharyan', 'Benghazi', 'Turkey']","Libya's Haftar Comments on Tripoli's Offensive, Oil: Transcript",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-05/libya-s-haftar-comments-on-tripoli-s-offensive-oil-transcript,None,

Libya's internationally recognized government said it seized sophisticated U.S.-made missiles after its forces pushed out eastern commander Khalifa Haftar's troops from a strategic city south of the capital.

The Javelin anti-tank missile launchers left by Haftar's forces were sold to the United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, according to photos released by the Tripoli-based government.

Their presence, if true, underscores the extent of foreign intervention in the North African OPEC member that is divided between warring rival administrations. It also raises questions whether the U.A.E. has violated the sales agreement with the U.S.

U.A.E. officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Haftar accuses his rivals of receiving Turkish military assistance.

Last week's capture of Gharyan, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, was the biggest setback to Haftar since his forces swept the south in early 2019 before launching an offensive in April to seize Tripoli. The attack has upended talks sponsored by the United Nations to end the nation's political divide.

In addition to the U.S. missiles, Haftar's fighters who fled Gharyan left behind Nimr combat vehicles produced by the U.A.E., Mohammed Qannuno, a military spokesman for the UN-backed administration, told reporters.

The UN and Western diplomats have warned the conflict, which has killed more than 700 people, would spiral into a proxy war between the rivals' regional backers as they jockey for influence in the oil-rich state.

Haftar is backed by Egypt and the U.A.E., which see him as a capable partner in fighting Islamist extremists. His opponents have turned to Turkey for help. Military assistance to the warring parties violates a UN arms embargo on Libya.

Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar ordered a ""harsh response"" to the surprise loss of a city that served as his forward base in a campaign to capture Tripoli, a conflict that has spiraled into a proxy war between the regional backers of rival forces in the OPEC state.

Haftar's Libyan National Army accused Turkey, which supports the United Nations-recognized Government of National Accord in Tripoli, of supplying armed drones that helped GNA forces take the city of Gharyan on Wednesday. The LNA banned flights from Istanbul to an airport in eastern Libya, where it's based, and said it would target Turkish ships and installations in Libya.

The capture of Gharyan, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, was the biggest setback to Haftar since his forces swept the south in early 2019 before launching an offensive in April to seize Tripoli, upending UN-sponsored talks to end the North African nation's political divide.

""There will be a harsh response by the armed forces, starting this night,"" Haftar said in a statement reported by the pro-LNA Al-Marsad news site.

The LNA conducted air strikes in and around Gharyan overnight Friday. A senior GNA military official told Bloomberg they had targeted foreign-supplied ammunition and equipment left behind by the LNA as they fled the city.

Libya is under a UN arms embargo that backers of both sides have repeatedly violated.

In Gharyan, GNA forces found abandoned Nimr combat vehicles produced by the United Arab Emirates, which backs Haftar, and other weapons supplied by the Gulf state, military spokesman Mohammed Qannuno told reporters Saturday. Pictures released by the GNA showed U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank missile launchers that had been sold to the U.A.E., according to markings on the weapons.

Western diplomats and Libyan officials have warned the conflict that has killed more than 700 people would spiral into a proxy war. Haftar has been supported by Egypt and the U.A.E., which see him as a capable partner in fighting extremists and bringing order to the chaotic country.

The diplomats and officials have also said that Haftar's forces have been assisted by air strikes using Chinese-made Wing Loong drones known to have been sold to the U.A.E. The GNA has accused Egypt of facilitating weapons transfers to the LNA across its border with Libya.

The GNA in turn has relied on Turkish military assistance, including Bayraktar armed drones that have been filmed near Tripoli's airport.

Haftar's attempt to take the capital and overthrow the UN-backed government in Tripoli has ground to a halt on the outskirts of the city, where militias who oppose the eastern-based strongman have put up stiff resistance.

The UN mission in Libya had called on Sunday for a humanitarian cease-fire to halt the month-long clashes that have killed more than 300 people.

But in a statement read by his spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari on the Libyan Al-Hadath television station, Haftar ordered his self-styled Libyan National Army to pursue the offensive.

Haftar urged his forces to maintain discipline and pursue their retreating enemies.

The White House plans to choke off oil exports from Iran without triggering a spike in prices largely by getting Saudi Arabia, the only OPEC member with significant spare capacity, to make up the shortfall. Yet his parallel interventions in Venezuela and, more recently, Libya could test the kingdom's ability to deal with further disruptions.

Crude prices have already climbed almost 40 percent this year, hitting $75 a barrel in London this week for the first time in six months. If reserve output is exhausted by multiple supply crises, it could surge to levels that hurt the global economy.

""While Saudi Arabia plus the Gulf states will be able to make up the shortfall in physical barrels, it will push spare capacity back to historic lows,"" said Neil Beveridge, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. ""This leaves little room for error.""

Concerns over spare capacity returned to oil markets after the White House announced on April 22 that U.S. sanctions will extend to all purchases of Iranian oil from starting next month, as a series of sanctions waivers granted to some customers expire.

The announcement marked a sudden twist in sentiment in a market that had been focused on whether Saudi Arabia and its partners have been cutting production deeply enough to prevent the ever-expanding tide of American shale oil creating a global glut.

""Replacing Iranian barrels will erode spare capacity"" and ""leave the market vulnerable to unexpected supply disruptions amid high geopolitical risk,"" said Helge Andre Martinsen, senior analyst at DNB Bank ASA.

The U.S. crackdown may slash Iran's exports by as much as 800,000 barrels a day, or about 60 percent, according to Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC. She estimates total Iranian sales at about 1.3 million barrels a day.

Making up for that loss would be within the means of other producers. Production cutbacks this year by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps about 40 percent of global supply, mean that levels of spare capacity are ""comfortable,"" the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.

The organization's four biggest producers currently sit on just over 3 million barrels a day of unused output capacity, according to the Paris-based IEA, which advises major economies on energy policy. About two-thirds is held by Saudi Arabia, which for decades has kept a portion of output idle to be used during emergencies.

Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on April 24 that, though the kingdom sees no need to respond immediately, it will cater to customers that presently rely on Iranian shipments.

""If you assume Iran exports don't go to zero, and China continues to take some Iranian barrels, then yes the Gulf states should be able to replace them,"" said Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix GmbH. ""But you still come back to the fact that the spare capacity is gone.""

Venezuela, the other OPEC nation in the cross-hairs of Trump sanctions, has seen its production plunge to the lowest in more than a decade as its spiraling economic crisis is compounded by a U.S. ban on imports of the Latin American country's crude. Current output of just below 900,000 barrels a day could collapse if the stand-off between President Nicolas Maduro and his opponents turns into a nationwide conflict.

""The most potent short-term supply risk is Libya,"" said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered Plc in London.

Libyan production, erratic for much of this decade because of political instability and civil conflict, now faces a new threat from military commander Khalifa Haftar's assault on Tripoli. Output stands at about 1.1 million barrels a day, but that could be at risk if the onslaught on the capital -- said to have received backing from Trump and his National Security Adviser John Bolton -- tips the country into all-out war.

Other oil producers including Algeria, Nigeria and Sudan have seen heightened political instability this year. The halt of Russian crude shipments through a pipeline to parts of eastern Europe on Thursday also highlights the potential for unexpected supply disruptions in peaceful parts of the world.

Last year, the threat of sanctions on Iranian oil propelled prices upward through the summer to a four-year high of $86 a barrel in October. That rally reversed abruptly after Trump, wary of the economic impact of $3-a-gallon gasoline, blunted the impact of his policy by granting unexpected waivers to buyers of the Islamic Republic's crude.

Now, as the market faces even deeper losses and the U.S. shows renewed determination to exert maximum pressure on Iran, the conditions may be gathering for another rally. Brent crude rose above $75 a barrel on Thursday for the first time this year, while U.S. retail gasoline prices are at a six-month high.

As fighting in Libya encroaches on the capital, Tripoli, the risk of new oil-supply outages from the OPEC member has risen. The country has been in disarray since Muammar Qaddafi, its head of state, was ousted and killed in 2011. Oil output surged in recent months as a fragile peace took hold, but the latest battles are a reminder that reliable crude flows require a political solution to end eight years of strife. An apparent reversal in U.S. support for Libya's government may make such a solution less likely.

1. Why has fighting erupted again?

Warlord Khalifa Haftar, who has used control over oil ports to exert political pressure, has moved his self-styled Libyan National Army west toward Tripoli, the base of the United Nations-backed, internationally recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Having solidified control in eastern Libya and swept through the south in January, Haftar's forces, supported by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, mounted a surprise assault on Tripoli April 3 to purge what he labels terrorist groups. Lethal clashes including air strikes prompted appeals by U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the European Union to halt the offensive.

2. What's the U.S. position now?

President Donald Trump indicated in a phone call with Haftar last week that the U.S. now supports an assault on Tripoli to topple the government, according to American officials familiar with the matter. An earlier call from National Security Adviser John Bolton also left Haftar with the impression he had a U.S. green light for an advance on Tripoli, according to diplomats. These accounts go beyond a White House statement about an April 15 call between Trump and Haftar. The statement revealed that Trump had undercut al-Sarraj's government by tacitly recognizing Haftar as a Libyan leader.

3. Could Haftar take the capital?

That's unclear. Haftar's ragtag forces are better organized than rivals and easily took over the south, including the biggest oilfield Sharara, through negotiations rather than fighting. However, resistance to Haftar runs deep in Tripoli, and militias there are more powerful than in the south. The battle for control of Tripoli could lead to some of the bloodiest fighting since the 2011 civil war. Even Haftar's foreign supporters have expressed public concern about the latest violence.

4. What would a Haftar victory mean?

Probably a unified Libya under his rule. Haftar already controls not just the nation's strongest military force but more than one million barrels of oil production a day -- the source of most of the country's income. About 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Tripoli is Zawiya, home to a major refinery and oil-export terminal. If Haftar took charge there, he would essentially control Libya's oil industry. That would enable him to deliver gains to his supporters in the east who claim that too much wealth is concentrated, and squandered, in the west.

5. Have oil exports been affected?

Major oilfields and export terminals are far from the clashes. But history shows that military activity anywhere in Libya can cause dramatic swings in output. In June 2018, Libya's crude shipments were suspended for weeks after Haftar captured two export terminals in eastern Libya from the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp. and transferred them to a rival oil authority. Exports dropped by 800,000 barrels a day, and Libya lost almost $1 billion before he handed the terminals back. Foreign buyers have so far refused to deal with the eastern company and purchase oil only from the Tripoli NOC.

6. How's this affecting energy markets?

The escalating conflict helped push oil prices above $70 a barrel. Libya was pumping 1.2 million barrels a day before the Tripoli clashes. A drop in production of half a million barrels a day, on top of coordinated curbs by other OPEC members, could cause prices to spike above $80, by one calculation. European refiners are the biggest buyers of Libyan crude, so they would have to find new suppliers if exports are affected.

7. What about a political solution?

UN mediation efforts were faltering even before the U.S. changed its stance. Al-Sarraj has accused Haftar of backtracking on promises to work toward a political compromise, and militias loyal to Tripoli have vowed to confront Haftar's offensive. The fighting caused the UN to indefinitely delay a planned peace conference to reconcile the feuding factions.

The strongman, Khalifa Haftar, who enjoys the support of Russia, France and Arab countries and controls much of Libya's east and south, launched a campaign to take the capital earlier this month. Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, who is backed by former colonial power Italy and other European countries, has said talks with Haftar cannot begin until his forces are withdrawn to pre-offensive lines.

Trump discussed ""ongoing counterterrorism efforts and the need to achieve peace and stability in Libya"" with Haftar, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement. Gidley called Haftar by the title ""field marshal.""

""The president recognized Field Marshal Haftar's significant role in fighting terrorism and securing Libya's oil resources, and the two discussed a shared vision for Libya's transition to a stable, democratic political system,"" Gidley said.

The Trump administration issued a stern warning to Libyan militia leader Khalifa Haftar to halt his forces' advance on Tripoli, and urged all sides to continue with political negotiations.

Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement late Sunday that the U.S. was ""deeply concerned"" about the warlord's threat to the internationally recognized capital. He said the military campaign was endangering civilians and undermining efforts to resolve the dispute peacefully.

""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,"" Pompeo said. ""There is no military solution to the Libya conflict.""

Haftar is moving his self-styled Libyan National Army west to Tripoli to fight what he says is ""terrorism,"" after solidifying control of the east and sweeping through the south in January. Clashes have continued on the outskirts of the capital, including air strikes, despite appeals by global powers to halt the offensive.

""A political solution is the only way to unify the country and provide a plan for security, stability and prosperity for all Libyans,"" Pompeo said.

The OPEC member's internationally recognized government said it would counterattack to clear Haftar's forces, which could lead to some of the bloodiest battles since the 2011 civil war that ousted strongman Moammar Qaddafi. As tensions grow increasingly inflamed, so does the risk of disruption to Libya's oil production -- fighting anywhere in the country, even if it's far from major oil fields, can cause swings in output.

The U.S. Africa Command is temporarily withdrawing troops from Libya in response to ""security conditions on the ground,"" the latest chapter in America's fraught military involvement in the North African country since Qaddafi fell. Libya's government said in February that joint Libyan and U.S. forces had bombed a site linked to al-Qaeda militants in the south.

A 2016 U.S.-backed campaign pushed local Islamic State groups from their stronghold of Sirte. But Libya needs more help from America to overcome its divisions and stop the militant organization from regrouping amid the current chaos, Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha said last month.

The U.S. urged Libya's Russian-backed eastern commander Khalifa Haftar to end his offensive on Tripoli and said it would support the internationally-backed government against any effort by Moscow to exploit the months-long conflict in the OPEC member.

""The U.S. delegation, representing a number of U.S. government agencies, underscored support for Libya's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's attempts to exploit the conflict against the will of the Libyan people,"" the State Department said in a statement.

The warning is the strongest to come from the U.S. since Haftar marched on the capital in April, signaling growing concern over the deployment of Russian mercenaries to the North African oil-exporter.

It comes days after Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, who heads the UN-backed government, called on the U.S. to help.

Libya's Prime Minister Says Russia Mercenaries Will Drag Out War

A private army linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin has been fighting on the front lines of the Libyan war for nearly three months, the latest projection of Russian power following a decisive military intervention on the side of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

More than 100 mercenaries from the Wagner group headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, also known as ""Putin's chef"" for his Kremlin catering contracts, arrived at a forward base in Libya in the first week of September to bolster Haftar, whose forces have been bogged down on the outskirts of the capital since April.

Their numbers have since risen to more than 1,400 troops involved in direct fighting and manning artillery, according to three Western officials. Wagner has also brought in pilots. One official said 25 pilots, trainers and support crew had been deployed. Two others said the pilots were flying missions in refurbished Sukhoi-22 jets belonging to Haftar.

Russia has officially denied the presence of Wagner troops in Libya.

Libya Uncovers Alleged Russian Plot to Meddle in African Votes

Libya has been wracked by violence ever since the NATO-backed ouster of Moammar Qaddafi in 2011. Years of instability allowed Libya to become a breeding ground for Islamist radicals, and a magnet for migrants hoping to reach Europe. Haftar launched his campaign on Tripoli just as the United Nations was laying the groundwork for a conference meant to reunite the divided country, which has dueling governments in Tripoli and the east.

The U.S. has mostly watched from the sidelines as conflict raged in the country that sits on top of Africa's largest proven oil reserves. It's sent mixed messages about its Libya policy, officially calling for a cease-fire even as President Donald Trump indicated support for Haftar in a phone call at the beginning of the offensive.

Its latest message, however, suggests a more decisive shift in policy with the launch of a ""U.S.-Libya Security Dialogue."" It came after a meeting in Washington attended by the Libyan interior and foreign ministers.

""This is more a reaction to the Russian presence in Libya than an endorsement of the Government of National Accord itself,"" said Emad Badi, a Libya researcher and non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute.

""There are two main issues now: whether this reactive approach will lead to anything constructive, and whether the sentiment expressed in the U.S. State Department is shared by other policy levers in the U.S. institutional apparatus.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['United States', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Moscow', 'Syria', 'Washington, D.C.']",U.S. Warns Against Russia's Growing Role in Libya War,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/u-s-warns-against-growing-russian-role-in-libya-s-war,None,
11400562,2019-08-25,"Sarraj, Haftar unwilling to back down in OPEC state's conflict

On July 26, Libya's internationally-recognized government announced a brazen air raid on a hangar housing drones deployed in support of rival commander Khalifa Haftar. A day later, his forces said they retaliated with strikes on a military base that sent fireballs into the night sky.

Neither side officially acknowledged the worst-kept secret of the North African state's civil war: as the opponents face a stalemate on the ground, their backers in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are engaged in an aerial campaign that's seen them target each other's unmanned planes in a bid to determine Libya's future in their favor.

The Tripoli government's attack on the airfield in Jufra was carried out by Bayraktar aircraft owned and operated by Turkey, according to two Western diplomats and a Libyan official, who all spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.A.E. struck back with Chinese-made Wing Loong drones, according to the two diplomats and an Arab official, targeting Bayraktars located in the coastal city of Misrata. Airstrikes have also destroyed three Ukrainian cargo planes supplying both sides.

Regional and European powers have competed for influence in the oil-rich country for years, but Haftar's offensive to capture the capital in April sparked an escalation in foreign intervention that has prolonged and deepened the conflict, sidelining United Nations efforts to seek a negotiated peace.

""The fact that these local actors can turn to outside factions is a disincentive for them to come to the table,"" said Frederic Wehrey, senior fellow in the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""They've got a stream of weapons"" to tap.

The U.S. indicated tentative support for Haftar, who's based in the eastern city of Benghazi, once his assault was underway and France has quietly supported both sides. But for the most part, Washington, with more pressing priorities elsewhere in the world, has watched as some of its most important Middle East allies battle for dominance in an OPEC state with Africa's largest oil reserves.

Libya has been under a Security Council arms embargo since 2011, when NATO-backed rebels overthrew Muammar Qaddafi and the country became fractured by infighting, creating a security vacuum that allowed jihadists and people smugglers to flourish.

But the sanctions are among the world's least enforced. The European Union's Operation Sophia, originally intended to intercept human trafficking across the Mediterranean and later extended to include the weapons ban, has little chance of intercepting arms shipments.

Oded Berkowitz, an Israeli security analyst, said in an interview he'd verified through open source images the deployment in Libya of Russian-made Pantsir surface-to-air missile systems and several types of armored vehicle manufactured by Turkey and the U.A.E.

Ankara's involvement in the war is partly fueled by commercial interests. It wants to eventually resume work on Libyan construction contracts worth about $18 billion and bolster its strategic clout in the Mediterranean amid a rush to claim offshore oil and gas fields, Turkish officials said in interviews last month.

But Turkey, ruled by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK party, also has a political agenda. It backs governments and groups across the Middle East that are anathema to Egypt and the U.A.E., both of which have set out to quash political Islam.

Three Turkish government officials as well as executives at Bayraktar, the drone-maker, refused to comment on allegations of arms shipments to Libya. However, Erdogan in June confirmed, without elaborating, that his administration was providing equipment to Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj's Tripoli-based government.

The U.A.E. government didn't respond to requests for comment. But in July, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said his country supported an end to the hostilities and a return to a political process, Al-Arabiya reported.

In Cairo and Abu Dhabi, Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army are seen as reliable if irksome allies in the fight against Islamists.

The 75-year-old former Qaddafi-era general is seen as a hardheaded commander who seldom listens to advice he dislikes. Yet from his eastern stronghold he helped secure Libya's frontier with Egypt after routing jihadists who'd overrun several cities and carried out cross-border attacks.

For Libyan Warlord Haftar, Tripoli Campaign Is a Life's Work

While Haftar controls Libya's preeminent military force, many supporters foresaw he'd struggle to take Tripoli. Egypt, France, and the U.S. tried to dissuade him, according to diplomats with direct knowledge of events. He ordered the advance anyway while UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Libya to prepare for a national reconciliation conference.

An adviser to Haftar, who holds sway over most of Libya's oil fields, said the general decided to go ahead with the offensive because he didn't believe Sarraj's Tripoli government would honor a power-sharing agreement they'd been negotiating.

Taking Tripoli would place him in a better position to control the country's financial levers, especially the central bank and the National Oil Corp., which Haftar admits has sole jurisdiction over the export of crude, Libya's economic lifeline.

As his forces remain bogged down at the capital's gates, with rising casualties and little else to show for the offensive, Haftar may even find his grasp over the east weakening -- an alarming prospect for his allies, and the U.S.

Washington wants ""the LNA at maximum humiliated but not destroyed, because the reality is they want some form of military actor to have a monopoly on violence or some form of control over the eastern region,"" said Emad Badi, a non-resident fellow with the Middle East Institute.

Libya Has a Shot at Peace as Combatants Tire of War, Envoy Says

Haftar's biggest setback came in late June. He'd built a forward operations base at Gharyan, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Tripoli, which was thought to be impregnable. Forces loyal to Sarraj, backed by Turkey's drones, blitzed the city in a day. The LNA responded by threatening to target the Turkish planes. It also rounded up a number of the country's citizens living in Libya's east, only to release them after Ankara signaled reprisals.

The LNA left behind a trove of weapons at Gharyan underlining the extent to which the war has become a regional conflict. Photographs released by the Tripoli government showed U.A.E-made Yabhon surveillance drones, Chinese guided-missiles, and American Javelin anti-tank systems abandoned by French operatives.

Sarraj's government disputed claims by Paris that the Javelin missiles were inoperable and belonged to a French counter-terrorism team, arguing they showed France's military support for Haftar.

The rising death toll -- the conflict has killed more than a thousand people -- and stalemate has raised pressure on Haftar. The UN negotiated a temporary truce over this month's Muslim Eid al-Adha holidays, and a grouping of countries that includes the U.S. called for a more lasting ceasefire and talks. The U.A.E. signed on.

Egypt has also endorsed a ceasefire, but along lines more favorable to its allies in the east. Arab and Western diplomats directly involved in the talks say international backers on both sides want to end the conflict as it becomes clear no side can easily win.

""A lot of military observers, including in countries that were biased on this side or the other side, came to the conclusion that this is something that is not going to be conclusive in any way,"" the UN special envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salame, said in an interview.

General Saleh Abuda's orders to the troops besieging Tripoli came through a crackling radio early in the morning of July 22. ""Destroy the enemy, advance on the capital,"" was the message, and with it another operation to break the stalemate in Libya's conflict had begun.

It unraveled within hours as Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army, or LNA, met stiff resistance. Shortly after the command, one pilot landed a beaten up L-39 Albatross Czech-made fighter plane on a highway in neighboring Tunisia and said he wanted out.

Libya is enduring its worst violence since the 2011 NATO-backed ouster of Moammar Qaddafi, which ushered in years of instability that allowed Islamist radicals to thrive and turned the country into a hub for migrants destined to Europe. Haftar had launched the war as the United Nations was laying the ground for a political conference to unite the country. It is now more divided than ever.

The latest upheaval in the North African oil producer started in early April when Haftar's fighters, the largest force in the country, first marched on the capital. With outside powers including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates backing him, Haftar promised an easy victory. But the government of Fayez al-Sarraj, which was installed by the United Nations in 2016, fought back hard with Turkish military assistance.

People are inured to the tit-for-tat violence, and the long power cuts and gas shortages. Shops stay open late into the night on streets humming with generators. The temperature rises above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in the daytime. In the center of Tripoli, a city of more than 1 million people, families go out for strolls in the night on the corniche overlooking the Mediterranean.

At the O2 café in Tripoli, documentary maker Samer says he didn't imagine the country would end up like this when he joined the rebellion against Qaddafi. ""I'm a realistic person,"" he said, declining to be identified by his full name. ""Whichever side wins, there will be infighting. Chaos is to everyone's benefit.""

Five days after the July 22 offensive, the LNA tried again to advance - and was repelled again. Near the front line, past miles of desolate homes south from Tripoli's downtown, medics had set up a field hospital in a sprawling compound that once housed the American embassy's staff before its evacuation during a previous war.

At the main clinic, a two-story villa nestled between an empty swimming pool and a tennis court, supervisor Abulqasim Shiwa woke up to the sound of bullets. The LNA had taken over a military base roughly 3 kilometers (2 miles) away. By 6 p.m., they had been forced to withdraw.

After treating a dozen wounded soldiers, Shiwa and the medics set out a meal on the villa's front porch, ignoring a drone that buzzed overhead before disappearing. They were cleaning up when the missile smacked into the porch. The blast blew the blood spattered front door into the villa, riddling Shiwa with shrapnel. Five of the medics were killed. Shiwa, partly shielded by a pillar, survived.

""I felt my shirt was on fire and when I took it off and saw blood,"" said Shiwa, speaking at the porch where the missile hit. ""I then started aiding people."" The surviving medics found the dismembered chest of one of their colleagues, Aws Nusrat, at the edge of the swimming pool.

That morning, Ramadan Hamoum, a high-school principal and commander of the pro-government Knights of Zawiya militia, had joined in an ambush that drew Haftar's forces into the military base before pounding them with anti-tank missiles.

Hamoum lost his nephew in the fighting. At his headquarters, a bullet marked villa a few hundred meters from the nearest LNA position in an abandoned airport, Hamoum was watching a National Geographic documentary on a big screen television on an afternoon in August. One of his soldiers was flicking through cell phone pictures of the LNA soldiers they'd killed.

""This one was sliced in half,"" the soldier reports. ""They thought they'd enter Tripoli easily,"" Hamoum said, grinning.

Division of the country's wealth, and who gets the largest share, has been at the crux of the power struggles. Haftar's war is just the latest, and has already killed more than a thousand people, including about 100 civilians, and displaced tens of thousands. Many have rented apartments in the capital itself. Others who are unable to afford the rent have been housed in schools turned into shelters.

In the district of Abu Slim, one elementary school is hosting 19 families. A handwritten sign on the door of a classroom reads: ""Welcome to your second home."" Each classroom has been given to a family. Some, like Omar Jumaa, his wife and four children, have been displaced several times since 2011.

Jumaa is from Tawerga, which militias from the neighboring city of Misrata had razed to the ground in 2011, accusing its inhabitants of having supported Qaddafi.

He moved to Tripoli, but was displaced again last year when a militia in nearby Tarhouna marched on the capital, demanding access to the city's finances. He now fixes air conditioners when he can to scrape by. ""This is my third time,"" he said. ""What can I say? We're used to it.""

It's a thought shared by many Libyans. On the morning of Aug. 24, a Grad missile slammed into a pavement at Tripoli's Metiga airport just opposite a row of airline ticket stores.

Hundreds of passengers sat in front of the entrance waiting for the flights, briefly suspended after the rocket strike, to resume. Days later, the airport suspended flights indefinitely after another rocket fell by a plane on the runway, injuring disembarking passengers.

The barista who runs a café at the airport just gave a wry smile.

Turkey would have the right to deploy soldiers in Libya if invited by the internationally backed government there, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told state-run TRT television in an interview on Monday.

""The moment there is such an invitation from the Libyan people, administration,"" Erdogan said, that ""gives us the right.""

Ankara signed a defense agreement on Nov. 27 aimed at strengthening forces controlled by Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj's government in Tripoli, with the capital under attack from eastern-based strongman Khalifa Haftar. Erdogan argued that possible deployment of Turkish soldiers in Libya would not amount to violating the United Nations' Libya embargo.

""The activity of sending soldiers in response to such a call from Libya's national government can never be interpreted"" as a violation of the UN embargo, Erdogan said. ""Turkey would decide on what kind of initiative it will take if it receives such an invitation.""

Turkey and Libya also signed a contentious maritime deal that may fuel an energy showdown in the gas-rich waters of the eastern Mediterranean, where both countries are at odds with Greece. The Nov. 27 preliminary agreement demarcates an 18.6-nautical mile (35-kilometer) line that will form the maritime boundary separating the two countries' respective exclusive economic zones. Libya's presidential council and Turkey's parliament approved the memorandum of understanding. It is now expected to be filed with the UN.

Greece, Cyprus and Egypt see the deal as a brazen Turkish bid for dominance in the contested waters. Libya is also in conflict with Greece over offshore-exploration licenses Athens issued for waters south of Crete, which is located between Turkey and Libya.

Libya needs more help from the United States to overcome its political divisions, the country's interior minister said, warning that Islamic State was taking advantage of the chaos to regroup.

While the Washington-backed fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has reduced the territory the self-styled ""caliphate"" holds, its militants are using the Libyan desert to regroup despite a 2016 U.S.-backed anti-terror campaign that pushed them from the coastal city of Sirte.

The United States should now throw its weight behind a push to end Libya's political divisions, said Fathi Bashagha, the top security official in the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.

""The danger is grave, because we're not capable of fighting them in an ideal way so long as the divisions remain,"" Bashagha said in an interview in the Tunisian capital, Tunis.

While the Sirte campaign damaged Islamic State's infrastructure there, ""the truth is many Daesh members sneaked into the desert before the battle for Sirte was over,"" he said, using the movement's Arabic acronym. ""Members from Iraq and Syria have joined them and they began to move around in the desert and organize themselves.""

Libya Forces Seize Last Islamic State Holdout, Militants Regroup

Islamic State first emerged in Libya's east, an area that was rife with extremist movements after the 2011 ouster of Moammar Al Qaddafi. It spread westward, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and decapitations. Over the past year, it has claimed several attacks, including at the elections headquarter, the Foreign Ministry and the National Oil Corporation's headquarters in Tripoli.

Analysts say Washington is increasingly disengaged from the broader efforts to stabilize the country, leaving the task instead to European nations and Libya's Arab neighbors. In addition, the United Nations is providing support and has called for elections.

Libya Summit Ends With Little More Than Pledge to Meet Again

No one has yet been able to make significant or lasting advances in reconciling the Tripoli-based government and its chief rival, eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar.

That disengagement deepens the problems confronting Libya.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies convene next week to discuss extending a 1.2 million barrel-a-day cut into the second half. While the cartel's three biggest members - Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates - are all willing to continue the policy of reduced production, Russia remains circumspect, prompting questions over potential changes to policy.

Meanwhile, myriad uncertainties cloud the oil market outlook. An ongoing U.S. and China trade spat is stoking fears over demand growth, while escalating tension between the U.S. and Iran has heightened geopolitical risk in the world's biggest oil-producing region.

Following are the latest positions of most of OPEC, plus non-OPEC members Russia and Azerbaijan. The respective shares of supply are based on May output. Estimates for the price each member need to balance its 2019 budget are from the International Monetary Fund, unless otherwise specified.

Underinvestment and a natural decline in maturing oil fields has resulted in Angola's output falling by about 350,000 barrels a day over the last four years, averaging 1.44 million in 2019. That's the lowest in more than a decade and less than OPEC's assigned quota of 1.48 million barrels a day, meaning it is likely to back an extension.

Saudi Arabia got a fillip last week when Azerbaijan, one of OPEC's biggest allies, said it supports an extension of the production-cuts deal into the second half. ""It would be right to extend the same regime"" unless something happens to change the current situation, Azeri Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov told reporters. Kazakhstan, its Caspian Sea neighbor, also backs an extension.

Despite a poor record of adherence to the deal (implementing just 26% of its pledged cuts on average in 2017 and 2018) Iraq's Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban reaffirmed his commitment to the OPEC+ production cuts. Ghadhban had previously said that Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer, sees the group and its allies extending production cuts ""at least"" on current terms without ""serious difficulties.""

Exempt from cuts, Libya's production reached 1.25 million barrels a day in May, a six-year high.

Nigeria's production exceeded 1.8 million barrels in 2019 thanks to the ramp up at Total's Egina offshore field. This means the country has cut output by less than pledged.

Russia has spent 2019 inching toward its output commitments, finally reaching its target in May.

Futures closed 0.2% lower in New York on Tuesday. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said the trade standoff is adding a downside risk to the central bank's forecasts, while the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development downgraded its projection for global growth. Meanwhile, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.4 million barrels last week, according to people familiar with the data.

International benchmark Brent crude finished the day 0.3% higher, as fighting in Saudi Arabia and Libya and a pipeline outage in Nigeria brought more reminders of the fragile state of supplies.

Oil has traded in a narrow band around $62 a barrel this month, as investor anticipation that OPEC and its allies may extend supply curbs has given the market some upward momentum. But rising crude stockpiles in the U.S. and the breakdown in trade talks between the world's two biggest economies has kept any rally in check.

""Given the fact that the macro environment isn't looking spectacular, oil is doing relatively well,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at Toronto's TD Securities. ""It's very much marching to its own drumbeat here, with the supply side being supportive in the face of less risk appetite.""

The first-month contract is trading at a strong premium to the second, a structure known as backwardation that's an indicator of tight supply. The global crude benchmark traded at a $9.05 premium to WTI for the same month.

11401005,2019-04-21,"Sanctions waivers that let countries purchase Iranian oil expire soon. What the president does next will have a big impact on the world's oil market.

The deadline for the U.S. administration to decide whether to extend sanctions waivers granted to buyers of Iranian oil is now less than a month away, and President Donald Trump faces a tricky decision. He undoubtedly wants to increase pressure on the Persian Gulf nation, but in doing so he risks stoking oil prices and with them those all-important gas prices in swing states back home.

Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, believes oil market conditions are better this year than they were in 2018 for accelerating the goal of ""zeroing out all purchases of Iranian crude,"" or so he told reporters last week. But the numbers tell a different story.

That is going to make it more difficult for Trump to go in hard on the remaining buyers of Iran's oil.

Crude prices have risen nearly 50 percent since Christmas, with WTI popping above $62.50 a barrel last week for the first time in almost five months. Retail gasoline prices are on a tear, too. The latest data from the Department of Energy show gas prices up by 18 percent since late February, bringing them back to where they were this time last year.

Meanwhile, in the Persian Gulf, Iran's visible exports of crude and condensate -- a light form of oil produced from gas fields -- have been rising steadily since the start of the year. Part of this increase may be due to more of the nation's oil tankers sending out the radio signals that allow them to be tracked, after much of the fleet turned off transponders to disguise their movements immediately after sanctions were re-imposed. But customs data from importing nations show a similar upward trend.

America's squeeze on Iran nevertheless allowed some nations to purchase its oil, under a series of six-month-long waivers. These were granted to eight countries, including China, South Korea, India, Japan and Turkey, as the restrictions were imposed in November. An estimated 1.76 million barrels a day of crude and condensate left Iran for those five countries in March, up from 1.42 million in February, according to Bloomberg tanker tracking.

This trend contradicts Hook's assertion that the U.S. is ""on the fast track to zeroing out all purchases of Iranian crude."" Three countries that got waivers have cut their purchases to zero, he added. In fact, those three countries -- Taiwan, Greece and Italy -- haven't exercised their wavers at all since they were granted. Refiners in Greece and Italy have not received any Iranian cargoes since October, while Taiwan took its last delivery in September.

Gas prices remain important to the president and their recent rise must be a source of concern.

The deteriorating situation in two of the ""Shaky Six"" oil-producing countries I identified a couple of weeks ago is also going to make toughening up the Iran sanctions more difficult.

Venezuela's oil production is said to have plunged by half during blackouts that rolled across the country last month. Heavy tar-like oil began to solidify in pipelines and tanks after heating systems lost power, causing substantial damage that could take months to fix.

Sanctions imposed on Venezuela's state oil company have accelerated the output decline, depriving Petroleos de Venezuela of its biggest buyer and the supplier of the light oil it needs to dilute the extra-heavy crude it produces. Output will fall further as the political crisis drags on.

Libya's production is also at risk again as forces loyal to strongman Khalifa Haftar advance on the capital, Tripoli, threatening a major escalation in violence. Output rose above 1 million barrels a day last month for the first time this year, after the country's biggest oil field was restarted following a three-month armed occupation. That recovery is now at risk again.

There are two things Trump can do, and his national security team is divided on the course he should follow.

He can allow the unused Iran waivers to expire, claiming a tougher stance without actually affecting oil flows, and perhaps trim the volumes that the remaining countries are permitted to import. Expect particular pressure on Japan and South Korea, who may be more willing than the others to acquiesce to U.S. demands.

He can also continue to lean on Saudi Arabia and the rest of the OPEC+ group to raise output. The Saudis would be very happy to boost production at the expense of their rival, but they will be much less willing than they were last year to do that before seeing Trump actually impose tougher sanctions.

If he has to choose between lower gas prices and tougher Iran sanctions, domestic considerations will probably hold sway. Expect more tweets aimed at Saudi Arabia and OPEC, followed by an extension of five of the eight the waivers, probably permitting reduced volumes of purchases for some, if not all.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['United States', 'Iran', 'Venezuela', 'Taiwan', 'Turkey', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Italy', 'India', 'Greece', 'China', 'Tripoli', 'Libya']",Squeezing Gas Prices or Iran?

11401035,2019-12-18,"Aggressive rate cuts helped boost Turkish assets since July

Despite a rough first half, 2019 has been good to those trading Turkey. Now, money managers and strategists say next year may bring back concerns that the market has grown complacent about.

Aggressive rate cuts by the country's central bank and improved appetite for risk assets proved powerful tailwinds that buoyed all Turkish assets, especially equities, in the latter half of this year. Investors may face a rockier path in 2020.

Market prognosticators say the U.S. election could turn the tide for Turkey, which has been shielded from punitive American sanctions thanks to a cordial personal relationship between the presidents of the two countries. Also of concern are the signs of weakness in Turkey's nascent economic recovery, prompting speculation that policy makers will be forced to boost stimulus at the expense of the lira and a recent slowdown in prices.

Credit Agricole SA's Guillaume Tresca says markets have been ""too complacent."" He sees an increasing risk that Turkish assets will give up gains in 2020, after high real rates of return made its currency an attractive carry trade this year.

The equity benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index has jumped 22% this year, while the the lira has depreciated 10% against the dollar and the yield on 10-year lira bonds is down 398 basis points.

""Given all the pending risks, carry is not enough to take a long-term

position in Turkish assets,"" said Tresca, a senior EM strategist. ""The second half of 2020 could prove to be more challenging as we expect the government's credit growth strategy to exacerbate macro imbalances and the CBRT to be slow to react,"" he said, referring to Turkey's central bank.

Here are the issues that analysts and asset managers say will be critical for Turkish assets next year:

A victory by the U.S. Democrats could change the White House's cordial approach toward Turkey, says Viktor Szabo, an investment director at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. He helps oversee $14 billion in emerging-market debt.

Since Turkey's purchase of a Russian missile-defense system, U.S. senators have sought to advance sanctions on the country. Such a proposal would penalize Turkey's leaders, energy industry and financial system involved in military action in Syrian territory controlled by the Kurds. Ahead of the U.S. election, calls for strong measures may increase, fueling volatility and keeping investors at bay.

""Pressure on President Trump to implement CAATSA sanctions on Turkey may generate sporadic headline risk for Turkish assets,"" said Phoenix Kalen, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. ""U.S. presidential candidates' positioning on foreign policy vis-a-vis Turkey may invite investor scrutiny on Turkish assets, although ultimately, we do not believe that Turkey will face serious sanctions next year.""

The Turkish central bank ""overcutting rates is the main risk"" that the country's assets face in 2020, according to Szabo.

After the central bank's new governor cut rates by 1,200 basis points, investors will focus on the speed at which rates will be brought down to the single digits promised by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

""Governor Uysal will have to slow down the rapid pace of monetary policy easing,"" said Piotr Matys, an EM strategist at Rabobank. ""Eventually he will find himself in a hard spot between the market perhaps pushing against further rates cuts and the influential President Erdogan who expects single-digit interest rates.""

While data exceeded estimates earlier this year, the consumer price index again rose by double digits annually last month.

The improvement has now come to a ""stand still,"" said Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors LLC in London. ""As the domestic economy picks up in 2020, fueled by renewed bank credit, any inflation concerns could lead to a sell-off in the bond and currency markets, particularly if this takes place against a background of further declines in the CBRT's repo rate.""

With the authorities fueling credit growth to try and revive domestic demand, there's a risk it could reignite the start of another boom-bust economic cycle, Rendell said. His firm is ""extremely skeptical"" that sustainable economic recovery can be attained, and ""any push for rapid growth risks negative consequences for the current account position and the inflation data will be manifest through a sell-off in the lira,"" he said.

""Geopolitics is still a wild card for next year,"" according to SocGen's Kalen.

Turkey's ground operation in Syria triggered an initial selloff in assets in October, as well as threats of sanctions from both the U.S. and Europe. Adding to worries of another flare-up is a recent pact with Libya. Turkey signed a maritime agreement with the country, and offered to send troops to the country if there was demand, a move that has drawn criticism from the European Union.

""If Erdogan will decide to send substantial troops to Libya that would present major additional risk for Turkey,"" said Anastasia Levashova, a fund manager at Blackfriars Asset Management.

A deterioration in the geopolitical situation, plus the looming U.S. sanctions, are ""the main pending threats that could fuel risk aversion,"" Tresca said. ""The markets have been too complacent.""

SocGen's Kalen also recommends keeping an eye on the formation of new parties by former Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan, particularly for whether they can successfully draw voters away from the AK Party. ""However, with no near-term elections, this development may have limited market impact in 2020,"" he said.

Earlier in December, Davutoglu launched his ""Future Party"" in Ankara, while former economy czar Babacan is in the process of building the foundation of a new party he plans to lead. Erdogan last week accused Davutoglu and Babacan of defrauding a state-owned bank. The former premier, who was handpicked for his cabinet role by Erdogan himself, denied the allegations.

""Tensions in politics may increase if Babacan and Davutoglu become far more vocal in criticizing the AK Party and trying to lure voters. Erdogan may try to front run them by calling snap elections, although it would be probably the most risky decision of his political career,"" said Piotr Matys, an EM strategist at Rabobank.

""The government is intent on reviving growth, which will require fiscal policy stimulus due to banking sector weakness (as a result of poor construction loan quality),"" said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging-markets strategist at SEB AB in Stockholm.

While Turkey had a two-month budget surplus in July and August after the CBRT transferred some of its so-called cash reserve funds to the Treasury, it posted a deficit for the 11 months through November.

11401036,2019-12-12,"Since the 2011 NATO-backed revolt in Libya that ended 42 years of rule by strongman Muammar Qaddafi, the oil-rich North African country has been in perpetual turmoil. The latest phase began in April, when military commander Khalifa Haftar and his forces marched on the capital Tripoli determined to unseat the internationally backed government located there. The ongoing battle for the city has accelerated interventions in Libya by Russia and neighboring countries as they maneuver to shape the future of the OPEC member state. More than a thousand people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced by the fighting for Tripoli.

Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj came to power through a 2015 United Nations-backed political deal. But a rival government set up in eastern Libya and aligned with Haftar, 76. His coalition of regular troops and militias, called the Libyan National Army, gained fame for taking the cities of Benghazi and Derna from militants affiliated with al-Qaeda. Haftar gradually extended his grip over the country's east and then the south, leaving him in control of most of Libya's oil fields and terminals. After an attempt last year to sell oil provoked a warning from the U.S., Haftar restored control of the resource to the National Oil Corp. and revenues from it to the central bank, both of which answer to the government in Tripoli. In April, Haftar moved on the capital.

Since the first week of fighting, the battle lines haven't shifted much. Backed by Turkish drones, forces loyal to the recognized government had several successes, including retaking the city of Gharyan, Haftar's forward base over the summer. Since then, they've struggled to hold their ground as hundreds of Russian mercenaries arrived at the front lines to support Haftar, bringing expertise in artillery and ground combat honed in Syria and the Ukraine. Backed also by Sudanese mercenaries and United Arab Emirates's drones, Haftar's forces are trying to breach defensive lines in the Tripoli suburbs.

Haftar had been vowing for years to take Tripoli, after a failed coup attempt in 2014 forced him to set up base in the east. The UN, U.S. and other powers had hoped to stave off a Tripoli offensive by negotiating a political agreement between the two factions. Haftar's advisers said they didn't trust Sarraj to abide by a power-sharing deal that would lead to elections, and accused him of being beholden to militias and extremists. They complained that oil revenues were distributed unfairly, to the disadvantage of the historically marginalized east. Sarraj's government responds to the extremism charge by pointing to its cooperation against terrorism with the U.S. and other Western countries, and the success of forces loyal to the government in driving Islamic State from the coastal city of Sirte in 2016. It accuses Haftar of seeking to restore military dictatorship.

Haftar has the support of the main tribes in the east and some cities in the west, including Tarhouna, which neighbors Tripoli. Sarraj's government is supported by militias in Tripoli and in neighboring Misrata, and the powerful forces of former defense minister Osama al-Juwaili from Zintan. Both sides increasingly rely on foreign patrons.

Though the U.A.E. and Egypt initially had misgivings about an offensive they predicted would turn into a quagmire, they've supported Haftar. Both see him as a reliable strongman who could end Libya's chaos, and they're opposed to some of Sarraj's Islamist allies, including the Muslim Brotherhood, which defines itself as non-violent but is considered subversive by some Middle Eastern governments. Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan embraces the Muslim Brotherhood and has enjoyed good relations with Sarraj. Turkey has secured from his government long-sought recognition for Turkish claims to a disputed gas-rich patch of the Mediterranean. Erdogan has said he's prepared to send troops to reinforce Sarraj's forces, if asked.

Initially, Russia kept contacts with both sides while promoting Qaddafi's son Saif as a future president. By September, however, Russia shifted to flat-out support for Haftar despite its misgivings about a figure who had connections with the CIA during a 20-year stay in the U.S. More than 1,000 mercenaries with the Wagner group, headed by a confidante of Russian President Vladimir Putin, are assisting Haftar. The U.S. has sent mixed messages to the Libyan rivals. The Russian involvement has prompted it to press more forcefully for a peace deal.

Libya sits on top of Africa's largest oil reserves. Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of the National Oil Corp., has warned that the Tripoli fighting could impact production. The country has suffered major oil disruptions during the years of upheaval but output has stabilized at more than 1 million barrels a day, still well-below the 1.6 million barrels a day produced prior to the 2011 uprising. Haftar's grip on the fields is precarious. The recognized government says it intends to retake them. In December, fighters loyal to it briefly reclaimed the El-Feel field in the south, causing a temporary shutdown of operations.

Germany hopes to host a conference in January bringing together the countries intervening in Libya. It wants them to agree to respect an existing UN embargo on arms transfers to Libya and to shape a political resolution to which the Libyan rivals can agree.

The Nov. 27 preliminary agreement demarcates an 18.6-nautical mile (35-kilometer) line that will form the maritime boundary separating what will be the two countries' respective exclusive economic zones, according to Turkey's Deputy Foreign Minister Yavuz Selim Kiran. It will be filed with the United Nations after the presidential council of Libya's internationally backed government signs the memorandum of understanding the two countries reached in Istanbul, Kiran said.

Greece and Cyprus see the deal as a brazen Turkish bid for dominance in the contested waters. Libya is also in conflict with Greece over off-shore exploration licenses Athens issued for waters south of Crete, which is located between Turkey and Libya. Turkey will issue more such permits for the Mediterranean following the deal with Libya, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said Wednesday.

""This agreement also amounts to a political message that Turkey can't be sidelined in the eastern Mediterranean and nothing can be really achieved in the region without Turkey's participation,"" Cagatay Erciyes, a senior foreign ministry official in charge of maritime and aviation boundary affairs, told a parliamentary committee on Thursday.

Erciyes shared a map of Turkey's claimed exclusive economic zone, including reference points to the latest agreement with Libya as E and F.

The eastern Mediterranean has become a gas hot spot with big finds for Cyprus, Israel and Egypt in recent years. Turkey -- which occupied northern Cyprus in the wake of a 1974 coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece -- vehemently opposes the Cypriot drilling without an agreement on sharing any proceeds.

Turkish drilling and exploration ships are currently operating off divided Cyprus under agreements with the northern Turkish Cypriot state, which is recognized only by Turkey. The European Union has said it is weighing sanctions against Turkey over its oil and natural-gas exploration off Cyprus, and Cyprus wants the International Court of Justice to resolve its dispute with Turkey.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ruled out any concessions on the deal with Libya. ""As long as the legitimate government in Libya stands firm on its feet, this new step will achieve its goal,"" he said Thursday.

Ankara last week also signed a defense agreement aimed at strengthening forces controlled by Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj's government in Tripoli, with the capital under attack from eastern-based strongman Khalifa Haftar.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Turkey', 'Libya', 'Greece', 'Cyprus', 'Istanbul', 'Athens', 'Crete', 'Israel', 'Egypt']",Turkey's Parliament Backs Contentious Maritime Deal With Libya,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/turkey-s-parliament-backs-contentious-maritime-deal-with-libya,None,
11401038,2019-11-26,"The deployment of Kremlin-linked mercenaries will make a costly civil war even harder to end.

Until recently, very little had changed in Libya since April, when General Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the self-styled ""Libya National Army,"" attacked Tripoli. Now, two high-profile stories have highlighted the presence of Russian mercenaries on the front lines of the war and their impact on the fight over Libya's capital. For the first time, a spokesperson from the U.S. Africa Command confirmed the presence of ""Russian private military companies"" in the west of Libya (Russia's presence in the east, away from the fighting, has long been suspect). And in an unusual step, a U.S.-Libya dialogue decried ""Russia's attempts to exploit the conflict against the will of the Libyan people.""

After seven months of equivocating about Libya's third civil war in nearly nine years, the Trump administration has an opportunity to play a meaningful role in stopping it. To do that, however, the administration would have to engage in uncharacteristically aggressive, and disruptive, regional diplomacy. Neither it nor the Obama administration before it has ever given Libya the U.S. attention it deserves.

The stakes are higher this time, with Russia threatening to tilt the balance of power and extend its presence on NATO's southern flank. The administration can acquiesce to Russia's spreading influence, or contest it by assembling like-minded states to give one last push to a political solution in Libya.

Libya's latest civil war has left well over a thousand dead and tens of thousands internally displaced. It has also paralyzed a political process led by the United Nations that sought to bring the country closer to a durable political settlement. Although the internationally recognized Government of National Accord's forces repelled Haftar's April assault, Tripoli has since suffered a mix of indiscriminate shelling and precision bombing, which has caused civilian casualties and extensive destruction to neighborhoods.

In addition to aid from Russia, Haftar has been helped by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and (to a lesser extent) France. The Government of National Accord has turned to Turkey to provide its militias with drones, armed vehicles, and other weaponry. A long anticipated UN report is expected to detail such arms transfers, which violate sanctions dating back to 2011. Separately, the UN Mission in Libya estimates that the LNA is responsible for well over 800 drone strikes, while the GNA-supported side is responsible for around 240.

The idea of permitting Russian interference in Libya contradicts the Trump administration's National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the National Security Council's Africa Strategy, which all focus on great power rivalry and countering Russian (and Chinese) influence.

Libya is a test case for these strategies. If Russia tilts the war in Haftar's favor, it will strip the West of influence in Libya either by ensuring pervasive instability or ending hopes of a peaceful political transition. The U.S has managed to keep a lid on terrorism emanating from Libya after the 2016 defeat of ISIS in Sirte through targeted strikes against Al Qaeda and ISIS-affiliated groups. If the U.S. Africa Command is no longer able to strike targets in Libya and leaves counter-terrorism action to Russia, ISIS will likely reemerge. See Syria for Russia's track record.

The Nov. 14 statement issued by the State Department condemned the ""LNA's offensive"" and Russian interference. Yet skepticism remains about the administration's seriousness and willingness to act. Since the statement was released, Haftar's forces have perpetrated a mass-casualty attack on a civilian target in Tripoli and a suspected military target in Misrata.

To allay doubts of a renewed commitment to Libya, the White House needs to reiterate the Nov. 14 U.S. statement -- and clarify its response to Russia's interference.

First, the administration should shed more light on Russia's actions in Libya, to the extent that it can without compromising intelligence sources. Various Libyan and Western officials have cited the presence of between 200 and 1,400 Russian private military contractors, most belonging to the Wagner group linked to one of Vladimir Putin's close associates. The U.S. should provide an official estimate of the number, and share what it can about their deployment and impact. Russia benefits from the deniability of Wagner; the U.S. should take away that advantage.

Second, the U.S. should threaten to sanction all groups involved in providing arms to Libya, including arms suppliers, shipping companies and insurers. To date, the arms embargo continues to be violated with impunity. The administration has existing authorities to sanction actors who ""threaten the peace, security, or stability of Libya,"" and the House and Senate have proposed legislation to support such sanctions, particularly against Russia. So far, these sanctions have been applied by both the Obama and Trump administrations only to internal Libyan actors.

Finally, the U.S. must vigorously back the Berlin Conference intended to unite international support for a ceasefire and reconvene a Libyan political dialogue. To do this, the U.S. must lean heavily on its partners in Abu Dhabi, Cairo, and Ankara to commit at least to a pause in arms shipments -- or face potential sanctions.

Exposing and isolating Russia in its attempts to tilt the balance of power in Libya may be the best way to stop its attempts to increase its influence in North Africa. As the Trump administration itself acknowledges, that goal is profoundly in the U.S. strategic interest.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Turkey', 'France', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Misrata', 'Sirte', 'Syria', 'China']",The U.S. Must Blunt Russia's Adventurism in Libya,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-25/the-u-s-must-blunt-russia-s-adventurism-in-libya,None,

Russian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Libya had planned to hold elections this year as part of a UN-sponsored roadmap that has been upended by an assault on the capital led by eastern commander Khalifa Haftar.

Laptops and memory sticks found with the suspects showed that they worked for a company that ""specializes in influencing elections that are to be held in several African states"" including Libya, the letter, stamped by the attorney general's office, stated. Two Libyan government officials with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed the authenticity of the letter.

A third Russian national had left the country before security services raided their residence, it said. The letter, dated July 3, does not mention when and where the arrests took place but one of the officials said the men were detained in Tripoli in May.

11401040,2019-04-08,"The Kremlin doesn't have the luxury of choosing allies: It has to go with adventurers and risk-takers.

The strong pushback against General Khalifa Haftar's bid to take the Libyan capital, Tripoli, endangers one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's risky bets. But even if Haftar loses, Putin will keep seeking similar adventurers in Libya and around the world to back.

Russia's version of great power foreign policy these days is an exercise in the art of the possible: Take a gamble on those who are themselves willing to take a gamble on Moscow's aggressiveness and the murky economic benefits it can offer.

In the 1990s, an impoverished Russia turned inwards and lost friends and clients throughout the developing world. Syria, ruled by the Assad family, and Algeria under President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who first visited the Soviet Union as a minister in the 1960s, were two of a few holdovers from the Soviet days, and Putin has gone out his way not to lose them.

But other strategically important allies in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America were lost to the U.S. and, lately China: Russia couldn't match the size and variety their investments. So the Kremlin went on a hunt for potential allies who might be interested in Russia's two-part package: On the one hand, military expertise and weapons, and on the other, the resources and know-how of Russia's civilian state-owned companies, mostly oil and gas ones but also the atomic power giant Rosatom and railroad monopoly Russian Railways.

That package can be more attractive to strongmen than seeking U.S. or Chinese support because it comes without visible strings attached and because it offers opportunities for personal enrichment. Not all of the assistance comes through official channels. Players like St. Petersburg entrepreneur Yevgeny Prighozhin with his private military company offer their services on a concession basis. The state companies, too, show an understanding for the peculiarities of doing business in countries without much of a legal framework.

By the time Putin became interested in expanding Russia's reach in the developing world, even the Soviet-era allies he had left had become shaky. Assad was involved in this century's deadliest civil war, and Russia had to mount a full-scale military operation to keep him in power. That was a risky bet that hasn't delivered a clear pay-off yet: Syria is in ruins, and the opportunistic partnership with Iran is more of an inconvenience than a helpful alliance, given Iran's problems with the Western world, Israel and, most importantly for Putin, with Saudi Arabia.

Algeria under Bouteflika was the single biggest foreign buyer of Russian weapons, and the Kremlin hoped to keep the relationship going even after the octogenarian agreed to cede power. But recent events have highlighted the fragility of these hopes. On March 19, Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra, appointed to the post just six days before, visited Moscow to tell Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and through him Putin, that everything would be all right and there would be continuity. But less than two weeks later, Lamamra was fired.

Russia's newer relationships are even iffier. The Russian investment in the Venezuelan regime of Hugo Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro is on the verge of being lost. A Syria-like operation there is hardly an option, both because of the logistical difficulties of deploying troops halfway around the world and because of the overwhelming risk of fighting in the U.S.'s back yard.

In Sudan, whose President Omar Al-Bashir has cultivated a personal relationship with Putin, Russia admits deploying both government and private military advisers; active Russian assistance to Bashir is more likely, should he needed to fight back against the protests that have continued since December. The potential upside for Russia is high: Apart from the usual package of arms sales and a nuclear power plant project, a Red Sea naval base for Russia has been under discussion.

In Central Africa, Russian military instructors are propping up a regime that doesn't control most of the country's territory. It's not a big investment for the Kremlin, though, and Putin is content to let private contractor Prigozhin take his cut and build goodwill.

The Russian involvement in Libya straddles the line between the old friendships and the new, opportunistic alliances with money-hungry regimes interested in Russian military support. The old, Kremlin-friendly regime of Muammar Qaddafi is gone, though Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, who harbors political ambitions, has maintained high-level Russian ties.

But, since 2017, Putin's generals and diplomats have built a new relationship - with Haftar, who commands the strongest military force in Libya and contains most of the country's oil and gas. The Russian government has negotiated with his opponents in Tripoli to relaunch Russian companies' Qaddafi-era energy joint ventures, but these negotiations are more likely to succeed with Haftar in charge than with the Western-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj.

Though officially bound by an arms embargo on Libya, Russia is reportedly supplying Haftar with weapons, and Prigozhin was present at a meeting between Haftar and Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu late last year.

Moscow's official line is that it supports the stability of developing nations in the face of Western attempts to undermine their legitimate rulers. That's the claim Moscow has made in Syria and in Venezuela, and if necessary, it'll make it again in Sudan. But in Algeria and Libya, where the situation is murky at the moment, Putin's bets are being made in private for now.

The problem with this entire series of bets, both official and semi-official, is that they depend on the success of players running extreme risks. In the absence of committed allies, Putin's Russia has to act opportunistically and seek receptive bedfellows. In countries with serious resource wealth and in strategically attractive locations, the choice is extremely limited. And with this crop of situational friends, you win some, you lose some.

If Maduro falls in Venezuela, Russia will be on the lookout for others like him to befriend in the region. If Haftar fails to win control of Tripoli and his hold on much of Libya's natural wealth weakens as a consequence, the Kremlin will be actively seeking others to empower so it can get back into the country's oil and gas sector and seek opportunities for a naval presence.

11401052,2019-11-21,"The real sin of ruling elites is not the capture of state resources, but failing to create enough.

There is little doubt that corruption is a principal motive behind the wave of protests sweeping through the Middle East and North Africa. In diverse national contexts ranging from Lebanon and Iraq to Algeria and beyond, angry demonstrators have blamed rampant and systemic corruption for the many ills of the political-economic orders governing their societies.

Western commentators and experts at international financial and development organizations have contributed to the anti-corruption discourse, claiming that corruption, cronyism and other practices of state capture have been the most powerful factors behind the MENA region's dismal and exclusionary development record. By the same token, corruption -- and more generally, bad governance -- have has often been emphasized as the main reason behind the inability of MENA countries to engage competitively and efficiently in the global economic order.

I am skeptical of this discourse. Even though the anti-corruption language has proved to be a powerful instrument in popular mobilizations against politically-bankrupt and venal elites, it has also veiled many of the structural aspects of the crises of MENA societies and political economies. Certainly, corruption is a big problem, but it is not the root of all problem as it is portrayed by activists and echoed by foreign commentators and experts. This reductionist view obscures more it than clarifies, and gets in the way of tackling the causes of the lack of inclusive growth.

Corruption is about distribution of national wealth in a way that serves the immediate lucrative interests of those in power -- and their cronies and relatives -- at the expense of the general public. But MENA countries have problems in producing economic value for distribution to start with. Most have rentier economic structures, with little ability to develop productive sectors that can compete globally while creating high-quality jobs and hence achieve inclusive growth.

This rentierism is by no means confined to those rich in natural resources, often oil and gas, like Iraq, Libya, Algeria and the Gulf monarchies. It extends well into secondary-rentier economies that have historically received recycled rents through workers' remittances, intra-government aid and credit from oil-rich countries or beyond, as with Lebanon's diaspora in the West.

The bottom line is that almost all MENA countries are integrated into the global division of labor as recipients of rent, either emanating from outside their borders or from very narrow sectors like extractives, in which few participate in the creation of value.

This rentierism is one of the causes rather than effects of corruption and patronage in natural resource-rich countries like Iraq and Algeria and secondary rentier economies such as Lebanon. Given the heavy dependence of these economies and states on rents, incumbents enjoy considerable autonomy from their citizens. They also have the resources to establish narrow coalitions of cronies and clients in order to keep them in office, either through some facade of ethno-sectarian democracy, as in Lebanon and Iraq, or on much more explicitly authoritarian terms, as with the rest of MENA.

Another dimension that is almost completely forgotten with the corruption-explains-all approach is the problematic trajectories of state formation in many MENA countries. Iraq and Lebanon, for instance, face big problems in nation-building that have historically led to weak states devoured by ethno-sectarian groups -- often with armed militias attached to them -- that colonized the state and captured public funds. Once again, corruption and clientelism are the effects rather than the cause of weak nation-states that lack even the monopoly of force within their own territories.

Beyond the domestic and regional dynamics, overemphasizing corruption as the cause behind MENA's miseries also ignores how the implementation of rounds of austerity under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have cut public investment without replacing it with private one. In fact, much of the deplored corruption was the result of World Bank-sponsored privatization of state-owned assets.

Blaming corruption has served to show the Washington consensus as a good program that was implemented poorly. This allowed for implicit -- and sometimes explicit -- blaming of the victims as being too corrupt to develop, despite the close ties that have bound many the MENA elites with Western powers.

These systematic factors might tell us why Asian economies could generate inclusive growth despite rampant corruption and poor governance indicators while MENA could not. In general, fighting corruption is a great slogan that has mobilized people across MENA against incumbent elites that have failed to guide their societies to better lives. But fighting corruption should not be confused with a development strategy in its own right, or taken as the diagnosis for the many and much deeper troubles facing that part of the world.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Lebanon', 'Iraq', 'Algeria', 'Libya']","No, Corruption Is Not the Root of the Arab World's Problems",https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-19/corruption-is-not-the-root-of-the-arab-world-s-problems,None,

A little-known law professor and a controversial TV personality looked set to compete in a run-off to become Tunisia's next president -- a resounding rejection of the status quo in the birthplace of the Arab Spring.

Interim figures show Kais Saied, a constitutional law expert who's supported by some of Tunisia's disenchanted youth, in the lead after securing 18.8% of ballots counted in Sunday's presidential election. Nabil Karoui, the owner of a TV channel who's competing from prison, has 15.4%. The election commission gave the figures after tallying 71% of votes.

""There is anger, hatred and resentment of the people against the political elites, whether ruling or opposition,"" said Sadok Hammami, a Tunisian political analyst. Many voters believe the ""elites betrayed the people and didn't represent them,"" so they chose the insurgent candidates, he said.

Victory for an outsider is a serious upset for Tunisia's political establishment ahead of legislative elections next month. While the North African nation has emerged from its uprising with a vibrant democracy, two thirds of the population say the government has failed to improve their lives. Since 2011, it has been hobbled by political infighting and sporadic militant attacks that have sapped the economy.

From two-dozen diverse contenders, only four -- Karoui, Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, Ennahda party deputy leader Abdelfattah Mourou and Defense Minister Abdelkarim Zbidi -- had been seen as front-runners. Mourou is currently in third place, with 13% of votes counted. If no one secures over 50% of ballots, the leading two will compete in a second round, likely in October.

Saied, who's 61 and ran as an independent, has come to be nicknamed 'Robot Man,' thanks to his rapid, fact-filled speeches during recent debates. He'd had little media attention until Sunday evening, when an exit poll showed him on course for victory and he declared a ""new stage in Tunisia's history.""

Some of the country's youth say they've found inspiration in this austere figure, who campaigned on a platform of decentralizing responsibilities to local authorities to empower people.

""Today the youth have regained their confidence via Kais Saied,"" said Rayan Ben Souf, a 20-year-old student shopping in Tunis' central market on Monday. ""He is against the system.""

The Robot Man's success was a shock to most -- some have even dubbed him 'the unknown president.' But that of Karoui, who ran while incarcerated, was more expected.

A self-proclaimed 'champion of the poor,' the 56-year-old has gained fame for shows on his Nessma TV channel in which he distributed charity to Tunisia's most needy. He was arrested last month on allegations of money-laundering dating back to 2016, which he denies. His Heart of Tunisia party calls it an attempt to quell an electoral upstart.

One opinion poll in June suggested Karoui might take votes from the established parties, including Nidaa Tounes, to which former President Beji Caid Essebsi, who died in July, belonged. Parliament failed in a subsequent bid to pass legislation that would have disqualified candidates with links to charities -- a step that would likely have affected him.

A conviction would rule him out of the race, but no trial has yet been set.

""Tunisians want to break with the old system,"" said analyst Hammami, comparing some of the circumstances to those that led to the U.S. election of Donald Trump. ""Populists have become an alternative to the traditional political elites.""

Turnout also signaled political disillusionment in the nation that's sandwiched between Libya and Algeria, and slightly bigger than the U.S. state of Georgia. About 45% of Tunisia's roughly 7 million registered voters cast ballots, according to the election commission, down from around 60% in 2014's presidential contest.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Tunisia', 'Tunis']","Fed Up With Politicians, Tunisians Back Outsiders for Presidency",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/robot-man-tv-mogul-gain-from-tunisia-s-rage-against-the-system,None,

Hedge funds are betting rising tensions around the globe will keep fueling oil's rebound this year.

Money managers boosted optimistic wagers on West Texas Intermediate crude to the highest since October in the week ended April 16, according to government data released Friday. Total long and short positions swelled to the most in six months, a sign the rally is luring back investors after 2018's late-year crash. The U.S. benchmark has jumped about 40 percent this year.

Oil surpassed $65 a barrel in New York for the first time since October on Monday as the Trump administration was said to decide it will scrap waivers allowing some allies to import Iranian crude. Conflicts in Libya, Algeria and Venezuela remain wildcards.

""You could see the balance swing a few million barrels in either direction in the next few weeks,"" Leo Mariani, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said on Friday. ""The potential for more supply outages is incredibly high, but the market is also increasingly uncertain.""

11401119,2019-12-30,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is considering sending allied Syrian fighters to Libya as part of planned military support for the besieged government in Tripoli, senior Turkish sources said on Monday, potentially bringing more foreign influence into the complex conflict.

President Tayyip Erdogan said last week Turkey would deploy troops to Libya after Fayez al-Serraj's internationally-recognized government requested support to fend off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's eastern forces.

The move is meant to protect Turkish private investment in Libya and bolster its energy claims in the Mediterranean, but could also put Ankara at odds with other foreign players in the war.

Two senior Turkish government officials and two security officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Ankara had not yet deployed any Syrian fighters to Libya.

""But evaluations are being made and meetings are being held on this issue, and there is a tendency to go in this direction,"" said one official, adding no decision had been made on numbers.

Turkey-backed Syrian fighters spearheaded a Turkish military incursion into northeast Syria in October targeting a Kurdish militia. Ankara, which opposes President Bashar al-Assad, also backs Syrian rebels in the northwest province of Idlib in Syria's nearly nine-year civil war.

It was unclear whether Ankara was mulling sending Syrian fighters as part of a first deployment into Libya.

Haftar's forces - supported by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan - have failed to reach the center of Tripoli. But they have made small gains in recent weeks with the help of Russian and Sudanese fighters, as well as drones shipped by the UAE, diplomats say.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitor, cited sources saying 300 Turkey-backed Syrian fighters had been sent to Libya while others were training in Turkish camps.

However, a spokesman for the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) on Monday denied that Ankara had made a request to send FSA fighters to Libya.

A military source within the FSA said the FSA was not being deployed to Libya, but that Syrian fighters in Syria and Turkey had signed up on an individual basis, for a salary, to work as ""bodyguards"" for a Turkish security company to protect bases and headquarters which Turkish forces will use in Libya.

Turkey's military has been involved in Syria since 2016.

""The military's experience abroad will be very useful in Libya. However, there is the possibility of using the experience of Syrian fighters as well,"" said one of the security officials.

""After parliament accepts the mandate, a step may be taken in this direction,"" the person added.

Ankara signed two accords with Libya's government last month: one on security and military cooperation and another on boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.

The maritime deal ends Turkey's isolation at sea as it ramps up offshore energy exploration that has alarmed Greece, Cyprus and others. The military deal would preserve its lone ally in the region, Tripoli, and protect investments by construction firms and other Turkish companies.

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said Turkey aims to prevent Libya sliding into chaos. Erdogan, who discussed the Libyan conflict with his Tunisian counterpart last week, has said a ceasefire in Libya must be set as soon as possible.

The deployment bill was sent to parliament on Monday, prompting the main opposition party to reject it on grounds it would exacerbate conflict.

The bill's text warned that Haftar's army has threatened Turkish companies in Libya and Turkish ships in the Mediterranean.

""Turkey's interests ... will be negatively impacted if attacks by the so-called Libyan National Army are not stopped and clashes become a severe civil war,"" it said.

Turkey exported $1.5 billion in jewelry, furniture, poultry and other goods to Libya last year, more than quadruple the imports of mostly metals from the North African country.

Construction firms including Ustay Yapi, Tekfen (TKFEN.IS) and Guris Insaat dominate the Turkish-Libya Business Council's board, highlighting the sector's interests there.

Turkey's foreign minister has warned that the Libyan conflict risks sliding into chaos and becoming the next Syria, as he sought to speed up domestic legislation to allow Ankara to send troops to the North African country.

Last week, Erdogan announced his government's decision to seek parliamentary consent to send troops to Libya, at the request of Tripoli. The troops would help to defend Libya's U.N.-backed Government of National Accord against General Khalifa Haftar's forces, which get military support from Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

A German foreign ministry spokesman in Berlin said Germany was following the reports about Turkey's military plans in Libya with ""great concern"". He urged all involved parties to exercise maximum restraint, respect an international embargo for arms exports to Libya and step up efforts for a diplomatic solution.

By Hideyuki Sano

TOKYO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks ended slightly lower on the last trading day of the year as investors booked profits ahead of New Year holidays, although the Nikkei average held near three-decade highs in dollar terms.

The Nikkei share average fell 0.76% to 23,656.62 on Monday, further from a 14-month peak of 24,091 hit about two weeks ago. The broader Topix lost 0.68% to 1,721.36.

The Nikkei in dollar terms, a more important gauge for foreign investors, stood at 216.80, near a peak of around 220 hit this month and not far from a 28-year high hit in 2018.

""There are two possibilities here. We could see fresh buying after a break of the previous high. Or investors could sell into rally,"" said Shuji Hosoi, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.

""At the moment, it is too early to say which direction the market is going.""

As Japanese financial markets will be closed from Tuesday through Friday to reopen on Monday, Jan. 6, many market players were eager to close their positions for now.

On the year, the Nikkei was up 18.2% after a 12% drop in 2018, while the Topix was 15.2% higher after shedding nearly 18% in 2018.

A broad range of shares fell, with all but one of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry subindexes in the negative territory.

Some said market sentiment was also hurt by rising political tensions in North East Asia and violence in the Middle East.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at a ruling party meeting, called for ""positive and offensive measures"" to ensure security ahead of a year-end deadline he has set for denuclearisation talks with the United States.

The U.S. military carried out air strikes in Iraq and Syria on Sunday against Iran-backed militia group, while Turkey plans to send troops to support Libya's government that has been struggling to fend off a months-long offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's forces in eastern Libya.

Many technology shares took the brunt of profit-taking with Fanuc down 1.8%, Shin-etsu Chemical shedding 1.3% and Honda Motor losing 1.2%.

Among others, Adastria dropped 6.8% after the casual clothing shop operator's quarterly earnings and profit guidance for the year ending in February fell short of market expectations.

Parco rose 10% to near the tender price offered by J. Front Retailing, which announced a plan to wholly own the company last week.

Turkey backs Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, which has been torn by factional conflict since 2011, and has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month.

Turkey has also said it could deploy troops to Libya if the GNA makes such a request. The GNA has been fighting a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces based in the east of the country. Haftar's forces have received support from Russia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.

""If necessary, we will increase the military aspect of our support to Libya, and evaluate all our options, from the ground, air and sea,"" Erdogan said at an event in the northern province of Kocaeli.

Speaking before Erdogan, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey will stand by Libya's government until peace, stability and security are established in the country.

Last month, Turkey and the GNA signed an agreement to boost military cooperation and a separate deal on maritime boundaries, which has enraged Greece. Ankara and Athens have been at odds over hydrocarbon resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus.

While Greece has said the accord violates international law, Turkey has rejected those accusations, saying it aims to protect its rights in the eastern Mediterranean. On Sunday, Erdogan said Turkey will ""absolutely"" not turn back from its agreements with Libya.

""Nobody should come to us with attempts to exclude us, trap us in our own shores or steal our economic interests,"" Erdogan said. ""We have no intention of starting conflicts with anyone for no reason, or robbing anyone of their rights,"" he said.

""Those who oppose us have no sense of rights, law, justice, ethics or mercy,"" Erdogan said, referring to Greece, Israel and Egypt, who have opposed the maritime accord.

11401125,2019-12-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is ""very concerned"" about the intensification of the conflict in Libya, with a rising number of reported Russian mercenaries supporting Khalifa Haftar's forces on the ground turning the conflict into a bloodier one, a senior State Department official said on Saturday.

The United States continues to recognize the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Fayez al-Serraj, the official said, but added that Washington is not taking sides in the conflict and is talking to all stakeholders who could be influential in trying to forge an agreement.

""We are very concerned about the military intensification,"" the official told Reuters. ""We see the Russians using hybrid warfare, using drones and aircraft...This isn't good.""

""With the increased numbers of reported Wagner forces and mercenaries on the ground, we think it's changing the landscape of the conflict and intensifying it,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to a shadowy group of mercenaries known as Wagner.

Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in the capital Tripoli and the east. Serraj's government is in conflict with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya.

Haftar is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and most recently Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials. The issue has come up in a meeting earlier this month between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.

Pompeo said there could be no military solution to the fighting and that Washington had warned countries against sending weapons to Libya, adding that he reminded Lavrov specifically of the U.N. arms embargo on Libya.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying since April to take Tripoli. Earlier this month, he announced what he said would be the ""final battle"" for the capital but has not made much advance.

The U.S. official said the involvement of Russian mercenaries so far has not tipped the conflict in favor of Haftar. ""It's creating a bloodier conflict...more civilian damage, damage to infrastructure like the airports..hospitals have been targeted. But at the same time we don't see that Haftar is gaining ground.""

Turkey has backed Libya's internationally recognized government led by Fayez al-Serraj and the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on maritime cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean as well as a security agreement which could deepen military cooperation between them.

In a first reaction from the United States on the agreements between Turkey and Libya, the U.S. official said the maritime MOU was ""unhelpful"" and ""provocative.""

""Because it's drawing into the Libyan conflict interests that up until now had not been involved in the situation in Libya,' the official said. ""With maritime boundaries, you're drawing in Greece and Cyprus...from the United States' perspective, this is a concern...it's not the time to be provoking more instability in the Mediterranean,"" the official said.

Ankara has already sent military supplies to Libya in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month. Its maritime agreement with Libya enraged Greece and drew ire from the European Union.

Two weeks ago, Libya's internationally recognized government and Turkey signed the maritime delimitation agreement, in a move that escalated disputes over potential offshore gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean.

Turkey says the accord aims to protect its rights and is in line with international law. President Tayyip Erdogan said that the accord will allow Turkey and Libya to hold joint exploration operations in the region.

Infuriated by the pact, Greece accused Libya's government of deception and expelled the Libyan ambassador to Athens. It also said it had lodged objections with the United Nations, saying the accord violated international law.

""We want to work with the Russians to get to the negotiating table, have a series of conversations that ultimately lead to a disposition that creates what the UN has been trying to do,"" Pompeo said.

But the United States last month called on the LNA to end its offensive on Tripoli. It also warned against Russia's interference.

""We have reached out not only to the Russians but to others who are providing weapon systems there and saying it's not in the best interest,"" Pompeo said.

11401129,2019-12-07,"(Reuters) - The U.S. military believes that an unarmed American drone reported lost near Libya's capital last month was in fact shot down by Russian air defenses and it is demanding the return of the aircraft's wreckage, U.S. Africa Command says.

Such a shootdown would underscore Moscow's increasingly muscular role in the energy-rich nation, where Russian mercenaries are reportedly intervening on behalf of east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar in Libya's civil war.

Haftar has sought to take the capital Tripoli, now held by Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).

U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, who leads Africa command, said he believed the operators of the air defenses at the time ""didn't know it was a U.S. remotely piloted aircraft when they fired on it.""

""But they certainly know who it belongs to now and they are refusing to return it. They say they don't know where it is but I am not buying it,"" Townsend told Reuters in a statement, without elaborating.

The U.S. assessment, which has not been previously disclosed, concludes that either Russian private military contractors or Haftar's so-called Libyan National Army were operating the air defenses at the time the drone was reported lost on Nov. 21, said Africa Command spokesman Air Force Colonel Christopher Karns.

Karns said the United States believed the air defense operators fired on the U.S. aircraft after ""mistaking it for an opposition"" drone.

An official in Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) told Reuters that Russian mercenaries appeared to be responsible.

Russian authorities deny using military contractors in any foreign military theater and say any Russian civilians who may be fighting abroad are volunteers. The LNA denies it has foreign backing.

One current and one former Russian contractor told Reuters that since September the LNA had received ground support from several hundred private military contractors from a Russian group.

Military officials linked to the GNA and Western diplomats have also confirmed the presence of Russian contractors in Libya.

Haftar, who claims to be fighting to rid Tripoli of Islamist-leaning armed groups, has received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, and, most recently, from Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials

Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russians' contributions of advanced capabilities -- everything from snipers to precision weaponry -- could be felt on the battlefield, boosting the morale of Haftar's forces.

""It's giving Haftar a real technological edge,"" said Wehrey, who recently returned from Libya.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in an interview with Reuters earlier this week, declined to comment directly on the drone but said he believed Russia was trying to ""put their finger on the scale"" in Libya's civil war to create a situation that was advantageous to Moscow.

Townsend voiced deep concern about Russia's growing role in the country, including how it would affect Libya's ""territorial sovereignty and AFRICOM's counter-terrorism mission.""

""This highlights the malign influence of Russian mercenaries acting to influence the outcome of the civil war in Libya, and who are directly responsible for the recent and sharp increase in fighting, casualties and destruction around Tripoli,"" Townsend said.

Mohammed Ali Abdallah, advisor for U.S. affairs in Libya's GNA, said the U.S. drone had come down near the pro-LNA stronghold of Tarhuna, 65km (40 miles) south-east of Tripoli.

More than 1,400 Russian mercenaries were deployed with the LNA, he said.

""Only the Russians have that ability - and they were operating where it happened,"" Abdallah said, in written comments sent to Reuters.

""It's our understanding that Haftar was asked by his Russian partners to claim responsibility, despite not having the capability or equipment to shoot down a US drone.""

The 15-member council urged all states ""not to intervene in the conflict or to take measures that would exacerbate the conflict"" and expressed concern at ""the growing involvement of mercenaries."" Such statements are agreed by consensus.

The council ""called for full compliance with the arms embargo,"" but any action over reported sanctions violations is unlikely, diplomats said.

11401131,2019-11-28,"ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognized government and Turkey have signed an agreement on maritime boundaries in the Mediterranean Sea that could complicate Ankara's disputes over energy exploration with other countries.

Turkey, which announced the accord and a deal on expanded security and military cooperation on Thursday, gave no details of their memorandum of understanding and did not specify where Turkish and Libyan waters meet.

Libya's neighbor Egypt dismissed the deal as ""illegal"", and Greece said any such accord would be geographically absurd because it ignored the presence of the Greek island of Crete between the coasts of Turkey and Libya.

Tensions are already running high between Athens and Ankara because of Turkish drilling in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus, and the European Union has prepared sanctions against Turkey in response.

The dispute has left Ankara searching for allies in the region. The new agreements were signed at a meeting on Wednesday between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Fayez al-Serraj, the head of the Tripoli-based government which Ankara is backing against a rival military force based in eastern Libya.

""This means protecting Turkey's rights deriving from international law,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said of the memorandum of understanding on the ""delimitation of maritime jurisdictions"".

He said that such accords could be agreed with other countries if differences could be overcome and that Ankara was in favor of ""fair sharing"" of resources, including off Cyprus.

But Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said any maritime accord between Libya and Turkey ""ignores something that is blatantly obvious, which is that between those two countries there is the large geographical land mass of Crete.

""Consequently such an attempt borders on the absurd.""

Egypt, which has been at odds with Turkey since the Egyptian military overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013, condemned the deal as ""illegal and not binding or affecting the interests and the rights of any third parties"".

The internationally recognized government in Tripoli confirmed the new agreements but gave no details.

The government in eastern Libya, where rival political factions have been based since 2014, said the maritime accord was illegitimate.

The Turkish presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun tweeted on Thursday that the agreement will strengthen military ties with the Tripoli-based government.

Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in the capital Tripoli and the east. Serraj's government is in conflict with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya.

Haftar controls most of Libya's oil fields and facilities but oil revenues are controlled by the central bank in Tripoli.

In June, Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) said they had cut all ties with Turkey and that all Turkish commercial flights or ships trying to access Libya would be treated as hostile.

""Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates routinely and sometimes blatantly supplied weapons with little effort to disguise the source,"" they said. ""The panel also identified the presence of Chadian and Sudanese armed groups in support of forces affiliated to the GNA and LNA.""

The report accuses Sudan and Hemeti of deploying 1,000 Sudanese troops to Libya in July to guard critical national infrastructure so Haftar's forces could focus on their offensive on Tripoli.

Libya has been one of the main departure points for migrants trying to reach Europe and has an estimated migrant population of 640,000. Boatloads of migrants leave frequently from Libya's north-western coast, though the number attempting the crossing has dropped sharply since mid-2017.

More than 50 people were killed and 130 more injured when a July air strike hit a migrant detention center in Tripoli.

The U.N. experts found that it was ""highly probable"" that the attack was conducted by a modern attack aircraft using precision-guided munitions ""owned and operated by a member state acting in direct support"" of Haftar.

11401133,2019-09-16,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces on Monday mounted an air strike on the central city of Sirte held by the internationally recognised government, an official and residents said, widening a conflict engulfing the capital Tripoli.

Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) force has been trying since April to take Tripoli, which is held by the internationally recognised government, with a ground campaign supported by air strikes.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people in Tripoli alone, killed hundreds of civilians, and risks disrupting oil supplies from the country in chaos since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

There have been LNA-claimed strikes in recent days on Sirte, some 450km (280 miles) by road east of Tripoli, but mainly on the outskirts, residents said.

Haftar, who is allied to an eastern parallel administration, might be trying to shift the frontline from Sirte away from Tripoli where he has been unable to breach the city's defences and even lost his main forward base in Gharyan, said Emad Badi, a Libya researcher.

Such a move would also pre-empt attacks on the main LNA supply base in Jufra, a central oasis, which the Tripoli forces have attacked by air, said Badi, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute.

The Sirte strike hit a building near a feedstock plant where the a local force securing Sirte is based, which an LNA official said had been targeted.

The Tripoli-based government also said on Facebook that drones operated by the United Arab Emirates had carried out strikes against the positions of a force allied to it.

The UAE has been backing the LNA alongside Egypt, according to U.N. reports, but neither country has confirmed this. Turkey is backing the Tripoli forces.

Mitiga airport, the only working airport in Tripoli, was also targeted in the early hours of Monday, an eastern military source told Reuters. It has been closed for two weeks due to continued air strikes.

Haftar and his backers say they are trying to free the capital from armed groups which they blame for destabilising Libya since the fall of Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising.

Haftar's critics accuse him of trying to seize power through a military coup, deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and west of the sprawling North African country.

Sirte, Gaddafi's birth place, was a stronghold for Islamic State militants until Tripoli-forces backed by U.S. airstrikes expelled the group in December 2016.

The coastal city lies at the unofficial border of areas of influence of the Tripoli forces in western Libya and the LNA controlling the east.

The LNA suffered a setback when two commanders of an allied force in the town of Tarhouna southeast of Tripoli got killed late on Friday.

Tarhouna is the main forward base from where arms and troops arrive from the east after the force lost Gharyan, a town some 70 km south of Tripoli, late in June.

Some of the four initial survivors told the Tunisian coast guard on Thursday that the boat had sunk off the town of Zarzis, Red Crescent official Mongi Slim told Reuters.

11401136,2019-06-16,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognized Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Sunday he was not prepared to sit down with eastern commander Khalifa Haftar to negotiate an end to the two-month offensive against Tripoli.

His comments to Reuters suggest low prospects for a ceasefire soon in the battle for Libya's coastal capital, where Serraj and his administration are based.

In the latest turmoil since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) force has been unable to take Tripoli despite fighting that has caused havoc in southern suburbs and displaced tens of thousands of people.

""I will not sit down again with this person because what he has done in past years shows he won't be a partner in the political process,"" the 59-year-old Serraj said in an interview at his wood-paneled office in central Tripoli.

The longest-serving in a succession of Tripoli-based prime ministers since 2011, Serraj has met Haftar, a 75-year-old former general in Gaddafi's army, six times in the past few years.

The last meeting was in February in Abu Dhabi as foreign powers sought to broker a power-sharing deal between the rival eastern and western administrations.

""He was only trying to gain time,"" Serraj said, pointing out that his rival had sent planes to bomb Tripoli.

Serraj struck a defiant tone, saying his troops, from armed groups in western cities, would continue to fend off Haftar, whom he views as a would-be dictator like Gaddafi.

""Our primary military goal is to defend Tripoli,"" he said. ""In the coming days there will be positive news ... progress,"" he said, without giving further details.

Calls from abroad for a ceasefire have fallen on deaf ears, particularly given diplomatic divisions over Libya.

Egypt and the United Arab Emirates back Haftar and have armed him since 2014 as a perceived bastion against Islamists, according to U.N reports. Haftar depicts himself as the man to reunite Libya and combat jihadists.

Most Western countries work with Serraj and Turkey recently sent him arms. France and other countries have proposed an unconditional ceasefire - without putting real pressure on Haftar - which would allow his troops to stay in western Libya.

But Serraj's camp has rejected that. ""You cannot ask the person defending himself to cease fire,"" he said.

In Sunday's interview, he backed a U.N. blueprint for a national conference to prepare for elections by year-end.

""Libyans should meet to overcome this (current) struggle for power,"" Serraj said.

The prime minister said he was concerned the OPEC member's oil facilities could become embroiled in the conflict.

Libya produces around 1.25 million barrels a day, the Tripoli-based economy minister told Reuters last week.

""For us, it is very important that oil production continues,"" he said. ""But there are dangers coming from the other side which has turned ports into military positions.""

State oil firm NOC has repeatedly warned its facilities could become dragged into the conflict. Last week, state oil firm NOC accused an LNA commander of arriving with 80 soldiers at the eastern oil port of Ras Lanuf.

The LNA controls all major oilfields and most ports.

Serraj said his forces would avoid attacking any oil facilities even if the LNA was stationed there.

The war was hurting Libya's development and basic services as funding had to be diverted to equip troops and treat the wounded, he said. ""There could be a (national power) blackout anytime,"" he said.

11401137,2019-05-04,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan state oil firm NOC called on Saturday for the safe return of the national head of the oil workers' labor union, Saad Dinar, who was abducted by an armed group on Monday near the eastern city of Benghazi.

""NOC is gravely concerned about Mr Dinar's wellbeing. He has not been seen since his seizure,"" NOC said in a statement. Dinar is also a NOC staff member.

NOC is based in Tripoli in the west of Libya, home to the internationally recognized government. Benghazi is controlled by the forces of commander Khalifa Haftar, who last month launched an offensive to take the capital.

Reuters was unable to reach eastern authorities for comment.

A source close to Dinar's family said he was driven to an unknown location by people who seized him at around midnight on April 29 near his home in Suluq, close to Benghazi.

Relations deteriorated last week between NOC, which handles oil and gas exports for the whole of Libya, and Haftar's forces.

Last week, NOC said several Libyan warships had used the oil port of Ras Lanuf, and that military personnel had entered the nearby Es Sider terminal. It did not say who was responsible, but the two terminals, Libya's biggest oil export ports, are controlled by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) force.

The LNA said last week that it had sent a warship to Ras Lanuf for a ""training mission"".

A spokesman for NOC told Reuters last week that the firm was ""concerned by renewed attempts to divide the corporation"" and was ""particularly alarmed by evidence of staff coercion.""

11401138,2019-04-25,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Eastern Libya commander Khalifa Haftar has thrown much of his military forces into attacking Tripoli, but the outcome of the offensive could be determined by a separate battle -- to keep open the parallel finance system that funds his soldiers.

Mobilizing Libya's biggest military campaign since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Haftar has advanced on the U.N.-backed administration in the capital from a bastion in the east, where he has a parallel government and central bank branch.

The general has funded his eastern state with a mix of unofficial bonds, Russia-printed cash and deposits from eastern banks, accumulating debt worth around 35 billion Libyan dinars ($25.18 billion) outside the official banking system.

But diplomats and banking sources say that those sources of support might be closing, as the Tripoli-based central bank, which controls the country's energy revenues, has taken steps to curtail the operations of banks in the east.

Those banks have in recent months struggled to meet minimum deposit requirements, which could give the Tripoli central bank allied to Tripoli Premier Fayez al-Serraj the excuse to shut off access to hard currency, they said.

""There is a looming banking crisis that could undermine eastern authorities' ability to fund themselves in the near future,"" said Claudia Gazzini, senior Libya analyst at International Crisis Group.

""The crisis was already in the making before the war broke out.""

Haftar has built up his Libyan National Army (LNA) with the help of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt supplying heavy gear such helicopters, according to U.N. reports.

But Gulf countries such as the UAE have preferred not to give cash directly to Haftar, fearing it will end up being used for the wrong purposes, several diplomatic sources told Reuters.

That has forced the septuagenarian leader to use merchants to import vehicles and other gear, using hard currency obtained from the Tripoli central bank and paid out by eastern commercial banks issuing letters of credit, military sources said.

There is no public data on the costs of Haftar's war, but he has sent more than 1,000 troops west plus support staff like drivers or medics, military sources and residents said.

Fuel is not a problem, costing just 0.15 dinars a liter, with state oil firm NOC serving the whole country.

But in its attempt to capture Tripoli the LNA has used hundreds of vehicles, with convoys going west non-stop from Benghazi, carrying anything from soldiers to ammunition to food.

In addition, every day two flights with Russian-made transport planes go from Benghazi to Jufrah in central Libya, his main base. Seriously wounded soldiers are flown to Tunisia.

The offensive has stalled, and so the LNA has vowed to move in yet more troops.

Haftar's finances face another potential vulnerability.

In November, the House of Representatives allied to Haftar approved a law to set up a military investment authority which gives the LNA control -- like in Egypt -- of parts of the economy including civilian activities such as scrap metal.

The investment vehicle's companies are exempted from taxes and import duties, as part of a welfare state envisaged by Haftar, but they need banks to deal with partners abroad and expand their businesses, analysts say.

""If the banks fail, Haftar's welfare state will come under pressure,"" said a Western diplomat.

Functioning banks are also needed for Haftar's parallel government to pay salaries and serve an LNA support network, analysts say. The central bank in Tripoli covers some public salaries in eastern Libya but not LNA soldiers hired after 2014 when the country split into western and eastern administrations.

The Tripoli central bank has already cut three eastern banks from Libya's electronic banking system to curb their operations. Lenders have still been able to get hard currency via other banks but in a further step the Tripoli central bank might shut access completely, diplomats and business sources said.

The Tripoli central bank (CBL) has vowed to stay neutral and but diplomats say it is also helping Serraj, approving his plans to allocate some 2 billion dinars for his own war effort.

CBL did not respond to mailed questions.

There has been a banking crisis building up all across Libya and especially in the east, where three eastern banks have struggled to keep a required 20 percent of customers' deposits at the Tripoli central bank: They have been paying out more hard currency in recent months, but need to balance accounts.

""Their deposits with CBL have fallen short of their statutory minimum requirements,"" Husni Bey, a prominent business leader and owner of HB group.

Data received by Reuters confirmed his.

Diplomats do not expect Tripoli central bank governor Sadiq al-Kabir to shut eastern banks completely as this would pose risks for western lenders. The same banks operate in the west and east with money flows hard to differentiate.

But they fear the longer the conflict lasts, the harder it will be to unify the central banks and repay debt.

The west has piled up debt of 68 billion dinars, bringing Libya's total deficit and public debt to 130 billion, including unpaid state obligations such as social insurance, said Bey.

The biggest worry among diplomats is that Haftar, who surprised world powers with his offensive, might try selling crude from oilfields and ports, bypassing NOC.

""If the offensive fails, Haftar might do this as he feels encouraged by (U.S. President Donald) Trump,"" said one Western diplomat.

On Friday, the White House said that Trump had told Haftar by phone he recognized his ""significant role in fighting terrorism and securing Libya's oil resources"", a comment which has enraged his opponents but fired up LNA supporters.",Reuters,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Benghazi', 'Egypt', 'Tunisia']","After Tripoli assault, Libya's next battle could be over banks",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-analysis-idUSKCN1S10KU,None,
11401139,2019-04-13,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces will pursue their advance on the capital Tripoli, the head of the eastern parliament in the divided country said on Saturday, despite international calls for a halt in an offensive that risks causing many civilian casualties.

His comments came as more clashes rocked the southern outskirts of Tripoli, where eastern forces have been confronted by groups allied to Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's internationally recognized government.

The European Union last week urged the eastern Libya National Army (LNA) to stop its attacks, having agreed on a statement after France and Italy sparred over how to handle the conflict.

But the eastern parliament head said they would press an offensive launched a week ago under military commander Khalifa Haftar, the latest outbreak of a cycle of conflict since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

""We need to get rid of militias and terrorist groups,"" Aguila Saleh, head of the House of Representatives allied to Haftar, said using a reference eastern officials often make to describe forces allied to the Tripoli government, which relies on support from several armed groups.

""We assure the residents of Tripoli that the campaign to liberate Tripoli will be limited and not violate any freedoms but restore security and fight terrorism,"" Saleh told lawmakers in a session in the main eastern city of Benghazi.

Forces loyal to al-Serraj's government have so far kept the eastern offensive at bay. Fierce fighting has broken out around a disused former airport about 11 km (7 miles) from the center and an eastern military source said a warplane belonging to the LNA had struck a military camp in an eastern Tripoli suburb.

Saley also said the United Nations mission to Libya and Serraj's government had been controlled by armed groups and had failed to expel them from the capital, and promised Libya would hold long-delayed elections after the Tripoli operation ends.

Haftar's offensive had surprised the United Nations, which had been planning to hold a national conference on April 14 to prepare Libya for elections.

The latest battle had by Friday killed 75 people, mainly fighters but including 17 civilians, and wounded another 323, according to U.N. tallies. Some 13,625 people have been forced out of their homes.

As well as the humanitarian cost, the conflict threatens to disrupt oil supplies, boost migration to Europe, scupper a U.N. peace plan, and allow Islamist militants to exploit the chaos.

11401140,2019-04-10,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Western diplomats sat down for three hours with Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar in his eastern stronghold last month to try to dissuade him from launching an offensive against the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.

They urged him not to plunge the country into a civil war and told him he could become a successful civilian leader if he committed himself to pursuing a political settlement, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting outside Benghazi.

But Haftar, a military strongman who critics describe as the new Muammar Gaddafi, paid them little heed, said the sources who spoke on condition the ambassadors were not identified. He said he was prepared to negotiate with the prime minister, but if no power-sharing deal was reached, he could invade the capital.

Two weeks later, on April 4, he sent troops from his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) streaming towards Tripoli - just at a time when U.N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the city to prepare for a national reconciliation conference this month which Guterres' aides thought Haftar supported.

For world powers including France, Italy and Britain, the general's military campaign, the biggest in Libya since the 2011 uprising that deposed Gaddafi, represented a major setback.

They had tried for years to co-opt Haftar, 75, into a political settlement that would stabilize the major oil and gas producer after almost a decade of conflict that had acted as a breeding ground for Islamist militancy.

Even the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which have backed Haftar and see him as a bulwark against Islamists in north Africa, appear to have been surprised by his rapid advance. A French diplomatic source said Paris, which has also aided the general, had no prior warning of the offensive.

The diplomats' calls for military restraint in the meeting last month had echoed those from other Western and U.N. envoys who had traveled to Haftar's base outside the city of Benghazi in the preceding weeks, four separate diplomatic sources said.

In a sign of how far the situation in Libya - and Haftar - was beyond their control, U.N. and Western envoys in daily contact with his camp about the conference had no idea he was about to launch the offensive, the four diplomatic sources said.

Some even thought the general was bluffing.

""These are just psycho games,"" one U.N. official texted Reuters when the first LNA troops were spotted south of Tripoli.

Some diplomats who had met Haftar many times and lobbied their governments to overlook his hardline comments - such as that Libya was not ready for democracy - despaired when it became clear he was committed to taking the city by force.

""I've wasted almost two years on Haftar,"" said one who met Haftar regularly. ""If the national conference doesn't happen, it was for nothing.""

Haftar, for his part, has been consistent in speeches and statements about his commitment to military force in his declared mission to restore order to the north African country and also dropped hints about ultimately ruling the country.

When he first announced his intentions in February 2014 he stood in front of a map of Libya, a somber-looking, gray-haired man wearing an immaculate army uniform, and vowed to stage a coup.

Western countries left Libya after fighting in Tripoli in 2014, closing embassies and ending NATO training programs, before returning in 2016.

Their period of absence opened the door for Arab countries such as Egypt and the UAE, which provided training and military assistance, according to reports from U.N. experts monitoring an arms embargo imposed on Libya in 2011, and diplomats.

Haftar's forces received aircraft as well as military vehicles from the UAE, which had also built up an air base at Al Khadim, allowing the LNA to gain air superiority by 2016, a U.N. report said in June 2017.

But on the ground Haftar was struggling to make progress in his initial campaign launched in May 2014 against Islamist militants in Benghazi, which he dubbed ""Operation Dignity"". His heavy guns and aircraft flattened residential buildings but could not dislodge the foreign jihadists holed up in booby-trapped houses.

It was at this point that France, which has oil assets in eastern Libya and is politically close to the UAE and Egypt, offered assistance, according to Libyan and French sources.

In late 2015, Paris sent military advisers and special forces familiar in urban warfare who camped out at an air base near Benghazi, the sources said. The French assistance helped turn the tide and allowed him to declare victory in Benghazi in 2017, they added.

Arab countries had recognized Haftar as Libya's official army commander for years but France helped him gain further international legitimacy as his campaign progressed.

In 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron received Haftar and the U.N.-backed Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Serraj, on the outskirts of Paris to try to persuade them to make a deal, which instantly upgraded the general's diplomatic status.

Macron and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian see Haftar, much like Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, as a buffer against Islamist militants in north Africa, according to French officials.

Le Drian has been to Libya three times in two years and on his last trip, on March 20, he saw Serraj in Tripoli and then traveled east to see Haftar to try to broker a detente.

According to a French diplomatic source, when Haftar asked him why he hadn't come for such a long time, Le Drian responded: ""We were waiting for your victories.""

He was referring to the general's campaign to take the south of the country earlier this year, the source said.

Following Haftar's Tripoli advance, Egypt's Sisi stressed the need for urgent international action to stop the situation deteriorating, without naming the LNA offensive. The governments of France, Italy, the UAE, Britain and the United States said in a joint statement they were deeply concerned about the fighting.

Le Drian told lawmakers on Tuesday that France feared more serious conflict, adding that Haftar and Serraj needed to agree on a ceasefire before resuming their dialogue.

The UAE mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. reports of military aid to Haftar. Egyptian officials also had no immediate comment on the reports.

Haftar was among officers who helped Gaddafi rise to power in 1969 but fell out with him during Libya's war with Chad in the 1980s. Haftar was taken prisoner by the Chadians and had to be rescued by the CIA after having worked from Chad to overthrow Gaddafi.

He lived for around 20 years in the U.S. state of Virginia before returning home in 2011 to join other rebels in the uprising that ousted Gaddafi.

Three years later Haftar made his own move, launching the campaign in Benghazi.

At the time he had gathered only around 200 soldiers and 13 helicopters under his LNA banner, said Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute international relations think-tank in The Hague.

However Haftar quickly attracted other soldiers such as the Saiqa (Lightning) elite unit as well as tribesmen.

There is no reliable figure for the current size of the LNA, though analysts say it runs into the thousands. The Saiqa alone has 3,500 men and Haftar's sons also have well-equipped units.

Haftar's forces outnumber his opponents scattered in different western cities but he has filled his ranks beyond a core of former Gaddafi soldiers with less trained tribesmen and Salafist fighters and foreign mercenaries, analysts say.

After Benghazi, Haftar gradually took control of the entire east of Libya, before turning his attention to the south.

However this month's Tripoli offensive is the commander's highest-stakes gamble yet.

He has moved much of his forces west, leaving his eastern home base exposed, and making it almost impossible for him to retreat without losing standing among friends and foes alike.

The battle for the capital is still raging, and little is certain. Some pro-Haftar media had predicted victory in 48 hours but the fighting is still mostly outside the city.

Meanwhile, his lightning drive has united opponents in western Libya who had not talked to each other for a long time but have now joined arms.

""Although none of the foreign sponsors behind Haftar is likely pleased with the dramatic deterioration, they have no option but to continue backing him,"" said Harchaoui. ""They have been concentrating most of their bets on one key figure for almost half a decade. This cannot be walked back overnight.""",Reuters,energy,,[],How Libya's Haftar blindsided world powers with advance on Tripoli,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-haftar-insight-idUSKCN1RM0PJ,None,

* UN envoy striving to prevent escalation of Libyan crisis

* Eastern commander menacing Western-backed Libya government

* Italy warns of possible international action against Haftar

* Neighbour Egypt says there's no military solution in Libya

By Ahmed Elumani

TRIPOLI, April 6 (Reuters) - The United Nations is determined to hold Libya's national conference on possible elections on time despite a surge of fighting in the country's eight-year conflict, a senior U.N. envoy said on Saturday.

G7 foreign ministers warned eastern Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar to desist from his thrust on the capital Tripoli, menacing the internationally recognised government there, or face possible international action.

Ghassan Salame was speaking to reporters in Tripoli a day after Haftar's forces said they had advanced into the capital's southern outskirts and taken its former international airport.

The offensive by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), allied to a parallel administration based in the eastern city Benghazi, escalated a power struggle that has fractured the oil-producing country since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

The United Nations aims to stage a conference in the southwestern town of Ghadames on April 14-16 to weigh elections as a way out of the country's factional anarchy, which has seen Islamist militants establish a toehold in some areas.

Salame, then U.N. special envoy to Libya, said he was striving to prevent the new crisis from getting out of control. ""We have worked for one year for this national conference, we won't give up this political work quickly,"" he said.

""We know that holding the conference in this difficult time of escalation and fighting is a difficult matter. But we are determined to hold it on time unless compelling circumstances force us not to.""

At a G7 meeting in France, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he and his counterparts had agreed they must exert pressure on those responsible for the intensification of fighting in Libya, especially Haftar.

Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said Haftar must heed international warnings to halt his advance on Tripoli or else ""we will see what can be done"".

The United Nations wants to find agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and transit point for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara with the aim of reaching Europe.

In Cairo on Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said the crisis in neighbouring Libya could not be resolved through military means, though insecurity there had long been a source of worry.

""Egypt has supported from the beginning a political agreement as a tool to prevent any military solution"" in Libya, Shoukry said during a joint news conference with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov broadcast on state TV.

Lavrov said Russia wanted all political forces in Libya to find an agreement and warned against foreign meddling there.

There were no reports of significant fighting on Saturday, a day after an LNA spokesman and residents reported that Haftar's forces had seized Tripoli's former international airport.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres departed after meeting Haftar to try to avert full-blown civil war. ""I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli,"" he said on Twitter.

Haftar, 75, who casts himself as a foe of Islamist extremism but is viewed by opponents as a new dictator in the mould of Gaddafi, was quoted by Al-Arabiya TV as telling Guterres his offensive would continue until terrorism was defeated.

The coastal capital Tripoli is the ultimate prize for Haftar's eastern parallel government.

In 2014, he assembled former Gaddafi soldiers and in a three-year battle seized the main eastern city of Benghazi.

This year, he took Libya's south with its oilfields.

11401142,2019-02-06,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces loyal to Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar captured the El-Sharara oilfield on Wednesday, officials said, apparently taking over the facility from armed tribesmen and state guards in a challenge to the Tripoli government.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) group, which is based in the east, called oil firm NOC to lift force majeure, a contractual waiver, it had declared when it shut down production at the 315,000-barrels a day oilfield.

NOC declined to comment.

El Sharara was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds.

The LNA said it had met no resistance.

Libya's oil industry has faced disruption since unrest began, with rival power centers in the west and east. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure.

Haftar is a dominant figure in the east where his Libyan National Army (LNA) seized the second-largest city of Benghazi in 2017 by expelling Islamist and other fighters.

Last month, his forces started an offensive in the south to fight militants and secure its oilfields, and on Wednesday made good on the promise by moving on the El Sharara field.

""Our forces arrived safely at the field,"" a spokesman for the forces, Ahmed Mismari, told a news conference.

A video posted online showed jubilant soldiers at the oilfield which is located deep in Libya's south and had been previously formally belonged to the Tripoli-based internationally recognized government.

A resident confirmed LNA solders were inside the oil field, a vast complex stretching for kilometers.

A Tripoli official, asking not to be named, acknowledged that the LNA was holding El Sharara.

Tripoli had earlier on Wednesday appointed a military commander for the main southern city of Sabha and there were unconfirmed reports that Tripoli would dispatch a force to secure El Sharara.

Haftar's forces are allied to a parallel administration based in eastern Libya. His LNA faction last month started a military offensive in eastern Libya to fight militants and secure the region's oilfields.

An executive at NOC unit AGOCO, citing OMV, said on Twitter the El-Sharara the oilfield could reopen in March. NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor.

The eastern government is allied to Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army (LNA) launched a campaign this month in southwestern Libya. Sabha had been nominally under the control of the internationally recognised government in Tripoli but in reality was run by local groups including tribes.

Control of Sabha is seen as vital for securing southern Libya's oilfields, one of the stated goals of the LNA campaign.

The interior, health and junior justice ministers of the eastern government, which is based in Benghazi, were seen meeting local officials in the municipality of Sabha in pictures sent to Reuters by members of the visiting delegation.

There was no immediate comment from Tripoli on the visit, which further highlighted the internationally recognised government's continued lack of authority in most of Libya.

The LNA has secured Sabha airport and other strategic sites in the area in recent days, after local groups handed them over without a fight.

The LNA says its campaign is aimed at combating militant groups and securing oil facilities in the south, which include El Sharara oilfield, Libya's biggest.

On Monday LNA forces killed a suspected al Qaeda fighter called Adel Ahmed al-Abdaly when they stormed his house in Sabha, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said. Otherwise the city has been largely quiet since the arrival of the LNA.

The Libyan National Army (LNA) faction killed Abu Talha al-Libi, a commander in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), together with two other militants, among them one Egyptian, in southwestern Libya, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said.

11401204,2019-02-14,"DERNA, Libya (Reuters) - With artillery fire rumbling in the distance, residents of Derna gathered in a streetside cafe on Saturday to discuss the future of their city, long a jihadist hotbed in eastern Libya.

Libya National Army (LNA) soldiers did not declare final victory until the following day over the Islamist militants whose rules had determined life in the city since strongman Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.

But for owner Saif and his cappucino-drinking customers, the talk was already all about what should happen next with more jobs, above all to keep youngsters out of the militants' clutches, the top priority for many.

""Seventy percent of residents are unemployed,"" he said. ""We need an economic program.""

In a city notorious for having sent Islamist militants to Afghanistan and Syria and where citizens were prevented from voting in the 2014 national election, public services have been deteriorating for years.

""We want better state services, health and schools,"" said Hafez, who runs a workshop.

Derna has had just one small hospital since 2011 and supplies are limited.

""We only have 120 beds instead of the 520 in the old hospital,"" said its assistant director, Adel Adwal, during a tour of the building. Only one, old X-ray machine is still functioning, but ""it can break down any moment,"" he said.

Libya's eastern government, which oppose the internationally recognized administration in Tripoli, has allocated 100 million dinars ($72 million) to restart public services, said city mayor Abdelmoneim Gheithi.

He was appointed by the LNA, which supports the eastern government.

Much of Derna's old city, where the militants made their last stand and a source said the Red Crescent found 35 bodies, has been reduced to rubble.

In the newer part of the city, which Reuters was able to visit, life appeared to be returning to normal. But appearances were in part deceptive.

Hundreds of families have fled to western Libya, residents say, fearing persecution after being accused of having supported the Islamists.

The United Nations said the humanitarian situation in Derna was of grave concern, with reports of scores of civilians cut off from access to food, water and healthcare.

It was monitoring closely reports of summary executions and had also heard of arbitrary detentions, with 2,000 people said to be held in one prison alone.

The eastern army's chief of staff, Abdel-Razeq Nathouri, rejected that figure, but said any soldiers who had committed crimes would face trial.

Another resident said the LNA had acted to prevent abuses such as lootings blamed on auxiliary tribal forces but reconciliation would take time as some wanted revenge for having suffered under the Islamists.

11401310,2019-12-21,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament approved on Saturday a security and military cooperation deal signed with Libya's internationally recognised government last month, state media reported, an agreement that could pave the way for military help from Ankara.

Turkey has been backing the Libyan government led by Fayez al-Serraj as it fights off a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces based in the east of the country.

Ankara has already sent military supplies to Libya in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month.

The two sides signed the deal in November to boost military cooperation along with a separate accord on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean that has enraged Greece.

The state-run Anadolu news agency said on Saturday that Turkey's parliament voted 269-125 in favour of the security accord after Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) ratified it on Thursday.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey could deploy troops to Libya in support of the GNA but no request has yet been made. He said on Friday that Turkey could not remain silent over Russian-backed mercenaries backing Haftar's forces.

Russia said it was very concerned about the possibility of Turkey deploying troops in Libya and that the security deal raised many questions for Moscow.

Erdogan will discuss Ankara's potential troop deployment to Libya with Russian President Vladimir Putin during talks in Turkey next month, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.

Speaking on Saturday, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said the accords with Libya were historic for Turkey and added Ankara was ready to evaluate possible troop deployment.

Ankara and Tripoli have also ratified the accord on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, a move which prompted Greece to expel the Libyan ambassador to Athens and escalated tensions in the region. Ankara and Athens have been at odds over resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus.

Greece says the deal violates international law, but Turkey has rejected the accusations, saying the accord aims to protect its rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Erdogan has said the deal will allow Turkey and Libya to carry out joint exploration operations in the region.

A senior U.S. State Department official on Saturday described the maritime agreement between Ankara and Tripoli as ""unhelpful"" and ""provocative"".

""Now with the maritime boundaries, you're drawing in Greece and Cyprus... From the United States' perspective, this is a concern,"" the official said. ""It's not the time to be provoking more instability in the Mediterranean.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Ankara', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'Greece']",Turkey's parliament ratifies security accord with Libya: report,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-libya-military-idUSKBN1YP0DA,None,
11401539,2019-12-25,"LONDON/ANKARA/ATHENS (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan paid a surprise visit to Tunisia on Wednesday to discuss cooperation for a possible ceasefire in neighboring Libya, where Ankara supports the internationally recognized government.

The visit comes after Turkey signed an accord with Libya's internationally recognized government last month that seeks to create an exclusive economic zone from Turkey's southern Mediterranean shore to Libya's northeast coast.

Ankara says the deal aims to protect its rights under international law, and that it is open to signing similar deals with other states on the basis of ""fair sharing"" of resources.

Greece and Cyprus, which have long had maritime and territorial disputes with Turkey, say the accord is void and violates the international law of the sea. They see it as a cynical resource-grab designed to scupper the development of East Mediterranean gas and destabilize rivals.

Greece has expelled Libya's ambassador to Athens and filed a complaint with the United Nations. Cyprus, where the northern part of the island is held by Turkey, has raised its own objections. At a Dec. 12 summit, EU leaders issued a statement ""unequivocally"" siding with member states Greece and Cyprus.

Egypt and Israel, which have invested heavily in energy exploration in the region, are alarmed by the Turkey-Libya move, which may threaten their ability to export gas to Europe. Egypt has called it ""illegal and not binding"", while Israel has said it could ""jeopardize peace and stability in the area"".

Following are some questions and answers looking at why Turkey and Libya struck their deal, the impact it could have on the region, and the shadow it casts over East Med gas.

Turkey has had disputes with Greece over islands in the Aegean for decades, and with the Republic of Cyprus over the island's maritime waters since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the north after a brief Greek-Cypriot coup.

In striking the deal with Libya, analysts say Ankara has essentially put both Greece and Cyprus on immediate watch, showing it is prepared to act tough to get its way and/or force new negotiations over their long-standing disputes.

At the same time Turkey has thrown a spanner into the works of efforts by Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Egypt to develop East Mediterranean gas, putting a barrier across a proposed pipeline that would run from Israeli and Greek-Cypriot waters to the Greek island of Crete, on to the Greek mainland and into Europe's gas network via Italy. The $7-9 billion pipeline would have to cross the planned Turkey-Libya economic zone.

Analysts say Turkey has effectively sent a message that it will not be ignored in the East Mediterranean, isn't going to let EU members access what it sees as its maritime waters, and doesn't want energy exporters like Egypt and Israel gaining leverage over Turkey, a net energy importer and transit state.

For Libya, the motivation is mostly security. The accord was reached with Fayez al-Serraj, head of the Tripoli-based government, who is in conflict with a rival military force in eastern Libya under General Khalifa Haftar. Turkey has promised to step up military and other assistance to Serraj. Libya's eastern-based parliament, which is aligned with Haftar, has rejected the maritime accord.

The East Med basin is estimated to contain natural gas worth $700 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. At one point it was regarded as a boon for the region, one that could deliver massive revenue, help forge a resolution to the Cyprus dispute and build closer ties between Israel and its neighbors.

But the key to unlocking the gas's value is exports and there's no easy way to do that. The proposed pipeline is costly and would run 3,000 meters deep in parts. The Turkey-Libya deal adds another obstacle to making it achievable. While there are precedents for pipelines crossing other countries' exclusive economic zones, Turkey won't make it easy. What's more, Ankara will use the deal to step up its claims to explore for energy in waters off Cyprus, where for months it has sent drilling ships, and in recent days flown exploration drones.

Analysts already had doubts about the viability of East Med gas because of the export difficulties and the price it would ultimately be delivered at, with Europe awash with cheaper gas from Russia and Qatar. The Turkey-Libya move only further complicates that difficult picture.

""In terms of geopolitics and East Mediterranean gas, this is a big deal,"" said Kadri Tastan, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""Turkey is making a big move to try to force negotiations on a number of issues. It's going to be very hard to resolve.""

As well as putting Turkey on a collision course with Greece and Cyprus, it ratchets up tensions between Ankara and the EU, adding to ongoing disputes over migration policy and wider questions over Turkey's role in NATO.

It also raises the stakes with Egypt, which has been at odds with Turkey since the Egyptian military overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013. Many of Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood backers now make their home in Turkey. In Libya, Egypt is more closely aligned with Haftar, meaning Cairo and Ankara are on opposite sides over the maritime deal.

Israel has been more circumspect over the Turkey-Libya move. One reason, analysts suggest, is that if the Israel-Cyprus-Greece-Italy pipeline becomes unviable, Israel may have to explore ways of exporting gas via Turkey instead. While Israel-Turkey relations have soured in recent years, trade remains strong and they regard each other as strategic partners. Israel will soon send some gas to Egypt to convert into Liquified Natural Gas for reexport, so relies less on Greece and Cyprus.

Russia is another piece in the puzzle. While it and Turkey are at odds over Syria, they coordinate on energy policy, and Moscow is keen for Turkey to transship energy. But the Turkey-Libya deal also puts them on opposite sides in Libya, where Russia leans towards Haftar.

11401540,2019-11-28,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - East Libya-based forces said their warplanes had attacked targets near oilfields in the southwest of the country on Thursday after fighting in the area briefly shut one field.

Mi-35 attack helicopters had struck at Chadian forces preparing to attack Sharara oilfield, Libya's biggest, a Libyan National Army (LNA) military official said.

The claim could not be independently confirmed. Both sides in Libya's conflict frequently accuse the other of depending on African mercenaries.

The LNA said on Wednesday it had driven rival factions from the 70,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) El Feel oilfield after carrying out air strikes, leading to a halt in production.

Engineers at El Feel said on Thursday that production was gradually restarting.

The National Oil Corporation (NOC), which operates the field in a joint venture with Italy's Eni, confirmed the restart, saying no staff had been hurt and facilities had suffered only minor damage.

The fighting reignited a conflict for control of large oilfields in southwestern Libya between competing military alliances that are also battling on the outskirts of the capital, Tripoli.

LNA forces also shelled rival groups aligned with the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli at an agricultural project near El Feel oilfield, the military official said.

The forces aligned with Tripoli had taken control of El Feel for several hours on Wednesday before being driven back.

Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in Tripoli and the east. Khalifa Haftar controls most of Libya's oil fields and facilities but oil revenues are controlled by the central bank in Tripoli.

Libya's oil production has been repeatedly disrupted over the past five years by conflict and blockades, but recently it has been relatively stable at about 1.25 million bpd.

11401541,2019-10-11,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - The U.N. envoy for Libya said he hopes an international conference next month will produce a Security Council resolution committing foreign powers to stopping an escalating proxy war and an accelerated mechanism to enforce an arms embargo.

The conference being organized by Germany is set to be the first major diplomatic push to end fighting that began when eastern-based forces led by Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive on the capital Tripoli six months ago.

It will seek to rally key external players to halt increasingly flagrant violations of a U.N. arms embargo and pressure their allies inside Libya to commit to a ceasefire and a new political process.

""Expressions of hope and encouragement and verbal support are not what I'm looking for - I'm looking for a clear expression of the will to end the war in Libya,"" U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame said in an interview.

""This needs to be expressed clearly in a U.N. Security Council resolution and in a follow-up mechanism in order to protect the implementation of this resolution.""

No date has been set for the conference, which aims to bring together the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council as well as the United Arab Emirates, Italy, Turkey and Egypt.

The UAE and Egypt have long backed Haftar, while France and Russia have also lent him support. Turkey and Italy - the only Western nations to have reopened embassies in Tripoli after previous rounds of fighting - have close ties to the internationally recognized government in the capital.

Salame said a U.N. panel of experts that monitors the arms embargo was investigating dozens of violations, and that foreign interference that was ""even more blatant"" than before included possible or potential use of foreign mercenaries and operators of foreign supplied drones.

The panel of experts is due to publish a report by the end of the year, but its detailed documentation of alleged violations in recent years - including by the UAE and Egypt - has not led to censure.

Salame said the reporting system needed to become quicker and more ""reactive"".

""We need them to express themselves immediately after the fact and not wait for an end-of-year report,"" he said.

""We need the sanctions committee to be more active in sanctioning those who violate the arms embargo, and we need the countries where those weapons are produced or brought to commit publicly to stop any transfer or arms to Libya.""

Libya has been divided into rival, shifting camps based in the east and west since 2014, three years after a NATO-backed uprising overthrew former leader Muammar Gaddafi.

The offensive against Tripoli, which quickly stalled on the capital's outskirts, exposed international divisions. Haftar launched his campaign on April 4 during a visit to Libya by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, 10 days before a national conference at the center of a peace process planned by Salame was due to take place.

Since then, the Security Council has failed to agree on any statement or resolution about the campaign. U.S. President Donald Trump called Haftar early in the campaign to recognize his role in Libya.

The conflict has left hundreds of civilians killed and injured and more than 120,000 displaced. On Oct. 6, an air strike blamed on Haftar's forces hit a riding club close to the U.N. compound in Tripoli, injuring several children.

Salame said there would be a call for a ceasefire at the conference, which he said he hoped would take place in November.

Libya's conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers, which have been backing various armed groups since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. The former rebels have been fighting each other since then.

Egypt, along with the United Arab Emirates, is a supporter of Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libya National Army (LNA) has been trying to take Tripoli from forces allied with the internationally recognized government (GNA). Turkey and Qatar both back the GNA.

Those nations, including Italy, Germany and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - which also have rivalries in Libya, met to break the deadlock and enable a U.N. peace plan to move ahead.

""The idea is to put a form of political pressure on all the main actors that support the factions and say 'Stop the military competition and proxy war and get around the table,'"" said a European diplomatic source.

The meeting is the first major diplomatic push since eastern forces loyal to Haftar in April launched an offensive to take Tripoli, held by the internationally recognized government of Premier Fayez al-Serraj.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people and derailed years of U.N peace efforts but gone nowhere as Haftar's forces have been unable to breach Tripoli's southern suburbs.

U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame last month unveiled plans for an international conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground.

Germany has offered to host that conference by the end of the year, although no date has been fixed.

""The idea is to get a number of key players on the same page, to move the process forward, to support Ghassan Salame and his calls for a ceasefire, for bringing the international community together and then eventually an intra-Libyan dialogue,"" a senior U.N. official said.

Salame thinks Germany can mediate, as it is seen as impartial in the conflict, in contrast to France and Italy, which jointly hosted Thursday's meeting but have been competing for influence in Libya.

Both countries brought Haftar and Serraj, along with regional players, together at summits in Paris and Palermo last year, but failed to achieve a breakthrough.

""Haftar's war attempt to forcefully enter Tripoli is about to reach the 180-day mark, and it still hasn't succeeded,"" Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute said.

Libya's conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers, which have been backing various armed groups since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. The former rebels have been fighting each other since then.

Egypt, along with the United Arab Emirates, is a supporter of Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libya National Army (LNA) has been trying to take Tripoli from forces allied with the internationally recognized government (GNA). Turkey and Qatar both back the GNA.

Without naming countries specifically, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told delegates at the U.N. General Assembly that there had to be a concerted effort to stop militias taking control of Libya and preventing support form external actors.

""We need to work on unifying all national institutions in order to save our dear neighbor from the ensuing chaos by militias and prevent the intervention of external actors in Libya's internal affairs,"" Sisi said in a speech.

Haftar's forces started a campaign in April with a ground offensive supported by air strikes and his backers have repeatedly labeled militias in Tripoli as terrorist groups.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people in Tripoli alone, killed hundreds of civilians, and risks disrupting oil supplies from Libya.

""This conflict needs to be stopped. It is time to take a bold and decisive stand to address the root causes of the Libyan crisis comprehensively and can be achieved by fully committing to the United Nations plan,"" Sisi said.

But addressing the same delegates shortly after, Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, accused Haftar's forces of carrying out war crimes with impunity and with the support of countries that were undermining the GNA and U.N. peace efforts.

""The latest military operations on the capital Tripoli have thwarted the holding of the comprehensive Libyan national conference,"" al-Thani said.

""There is an internationally recognized settlement, but certain countries say they formally participate in international efforts on one hand and then undermine these efforts on another hand by supporting warlords and terrorist militias for their narrow interests against the legitimate government,"" he said.

Doha and Cairo's differences were being openly voiced weeks after U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame unveiled plans for an international conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground, without naming a venue.

Germany emerged as a possible location with Berlin trying to put it together by October.

Salame believes Germany can mediate because it is seen as impartial in the conflict in contrast to France and Italy, which have been competing for influence.

France and Italy have oil and gas interests in Libya and have been accused of also backing protagonists in the conflict.

Both countries brought Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, along with regional players, together in Paris and Palermo last year, but failed to achieve a breakthrough.

The two will host a ministerial meeting of countries involved in the Libyan conflict at the U.N. on Thursday, with the aim to bridge differences between all sides.

11401544,2019-09-11,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Germany aims to host a conference about Libya this year in conjunction with the United Nations to try to stabilize the oil producing country, where rival factions have been fighting over the capital, Germany's ambassador to Libya said on Wednesday.

The plans, which are still in the early stages according to diplomats, are the first major diplomatic push since eastern forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar launched in April an offensive to take the capital Tripoli, held by the internationally recognized government of Premier Fayez al-Serraj.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people and derailed years of U.N peace efforts but gone nowhere as Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) has been unable to breach Tripoli's southern suburbs.

U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame last month unveiled plans for an international Libya conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground, without naming a venue.

""Germany therefore initiated a consultation process with key international partners. With sufficient preparatory work these efforts could lead toward a meaningful international event this fall,"" Oliver Owcza, Germany's ambassador to Libya, said on Twitter.

He gave no details on the event announced just after German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament the situation in the north African country risked destabilizing the whole of Africa.

Diplomatic sources said the event would be held in Berlin in October or November.

Libya's conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers which have been backing various armed group since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi - the former rebels have been fighting each other since then.

Haftar, who is allied to a parallel government in the east, has for years enjoyed the military support of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, U.N. reports say.

Turkey has been backing Serraj and has been sending his forces combat drones and vehicles since the start of the war which has balanced out a military edge for the LNA, diplomats say.

Salame thinks Germany can mediate, as it is seen as impartial in the conflict in contrast to France and Italy, which have been competing for influence and have oil and gas interests in Libya, diplomats say.

Both countries brought Haftar and Serraj plus regional players together at summits in Paris and Palermo last year, but didn't achieve a breakthrough.

Germany has strong ties with Turkey and Egypt, whose bilateral ties have been strained since the Egyptian military, then led by Abdel al-Fattah al-Sisi, ousted the Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.

The conference's goal would be to push foreign players to enforce an existing arms embargo and for a ceasefire to allow Libyans to meet afterwards for political talks.

Key obstacles will be to get Turkey to sit with top officials from Egypt and the UAE, Western diplomats say.

The Turkish delegation withdrew at the last Libya conference held by Italy in November after Turkey Vice President Fuat Oktay was not allowed to join meetings between Haftar, Serraj, Sisi and European actors such as Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, according to diplomats.",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'Germany', 'Tripoli', 'Cairo', 'Egypt', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Palermo', 'Turkey', 'Italy', 'France', 'United Arab Emirates']",Germany aims to host Libya conference to stabilize oil producer,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-germany-idUSKCN1VW23S,None,
11401545,2019-07-10,"PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday anti-tank missiles it bought from the United States and were later found in a base belonging to troops loyal to Libya's eastern commander Khalifa Haftar were never intended for sale or transfer to any party to Libya's conflict.

The Army Ministry said the missiles were intended for the ""self-protection of a French military unit deployed to carry out intelligence and counter-terrorism operations"".

""Damaged and unusable, the armaments were being temporarily stocked at a depot ahead of their destruction,"" the ministry said in a statement.

It is the first time since 2016 that France has publicly acknowledged it still has special forces deployed in Libya. It is not clear how many troops are deployed.

The cache of four Javelin anti-tank missiles were discovered after forces loyal to the U.N.-backed government raided the camp in Gheryan, in the mountains south of Tripoli, on June 26, the New York Times earlier reported.

Gheryan was the headquarters for Haftar's forces as they massed for an assault on Tripoli in an attempt to overthrow the U.N.-backed government.

France broadly supports Haftar, regarding his forces as helpful in the fight against Islamist militants.

In its statement, the Army Ministry denied the Javelins had been transferred to a local force, and reiterated that the arms were not subject to import restrictions because they were intended for the protection of French troops.

""France has long supported all established forces engaged in the fight against terrorism, in Libya, in the Tripoli area and in Cyrenaica (the east of the country), as well as more broadly in the Sahel,"" it said.

On Wednesday, Tripoli's forces took Gharyan, south of the capital, which eastern forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar had used as their main supply base to attack Tripoli, home to the recognized administration.

Officials showed journalists weapons they said had been seized, among them sophisticated U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank missiles.

They also presented advanced Chinese-made laser-guided artillery shells, and said combat drones had been also been captured, in addition to some 150 prisoners.

Inscriptions on the Javelin missiles said they had originally belonged to the armed forces of the United Arab Emirates, one of Haftar's main backers.

U.N. reports have previously said that the UAE and Egypt have been arming Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) since 2014, but details have been unclear.

Oded Berkowitz, Israeli security analyst and deputy chief intelligence officer of the MAX consultancy, said it was the first time that Javelins had been sighted in the Libya conflict.

""The weapons themselves are highly advanced but wouldn't be a game changer in Libya,"" he said. ""The real political game changer is the fact that advanced U.S. systems were delivered to a third party, and this may push the U.S. to oppose the UAE and their support for the LNA.""

Haftar began his assault on Tripoli on April 4, surprising the United Nations, which had been preparing for a national conference to try to end the chaos gripping Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

11401549,2019-05-04,"BENGHAZI/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Nine soldiers were killed on Saturday in an attack claimed by Islamic State on a training camp belonging to the eastern Libyan forces of Khalifa Haftar, hospital authorities said.

The attack took place in the city of Sebha, located in part of the oil-producing south that is targeted by armed groups looking to exploit a security void.

Haftar has concentrated his forces in the northwest, where they have been embroiled for the past month in a battle for the capital Tripoli with fighters allied to the divided country's internationally recognized government.

Clashes raged in Tripoli's southern outskirts throughout the night with the rival forces firing at each other with artillery guns, residents said. No more details were immediately available.

Islamic State claimed the Sebha attack. Its fighters had killed or wounded 16 and freed inmates from a prison, the jihadist group said in a statement posted online.

A military source said a jail inside the attacked Jabril Baba camp had been stormed but gave no details. Sebha hospital put the number of dead at nine, a statement on its website said.

Hamed al-Khaiyali, head of the local municipality, earlier told Reuters one soldier had been beheaded and seven others ""slaughtered"" or shot. Pictures posted online showed bodies fully covered by blankets.

A source in Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) blamed Islamic State and Chadian fighters for the attack, the latter a term used by the LNA for tribesmen opposing Haftar.

News-gathering in southern Libya is difficult due to the absence of an effective state authority in a region dominated by different armed groups and tribes.

The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, faced strong opposition from ethnic Tebus during a military campaign it ran in the south at the start of the year.

Sebha - like much of the south and its oilfields - is controlled by the LNA but the force has co-opted local armed groups and tribesmen to control territory.

Such alliances often shift in a country that has been in chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The LNA has moved troops from its southern campaign toward the Tripoli front, also moving in heavy guns in the past week. But it has been unable to breach defenses in the city's southern suburbs.

Islamic State is active in the south to where it retreated after losing its stronghold in the central city of Sirte in December 2016.

There have been several attacks in southern Libya since the Tripoli offensive, among them an assault on the Tamanhint air base outside Sebha and clashes at the El Sharara oilfield, the country's biggest.

11401550,2019-04-29,"LONDON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Eastern-based Libyan forces led by Khalifa Haftar launched an offensive in April on the capital Tripoli in the west that has plunged the oil-producing nation into a new bout of conflict.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has faced fierce resistance from forces loyal to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, threatening fresh disruption to the OPEC state's energy industry.

The renewed risk to Libyan output has supported oil prices that are already trading close to six-month highs.

As a major oil supplier to Europe and starting point for migrant flows to Italy, much is at stake if the country slips further into turmoil.

Libya began fracturing in 2011 when groups took up arms to topple leader Muammar Gaddafi during the Arab Spring uprisings, but the groups also started fighting each other due to political, ideological and geographical rivalries.

Gaddafi ruled Libya with an iron fist for 42 years here, keeping control over its tribes and clans, and quelling Islamist militants.

As rival militias swelled and Islamist militants gained a foothold in Libya after Gaddafi's fall, former army general Haftar presented himself as the man who could crush the extremists and bring militia groups to heel.

But Haftar is a divisive figure. Despite building a powerbase in the east of the country, he is distrusted in the west, where his military campaign has faltered. Critics say he wants to return Libya to authoritarian rule.

Once Africa's third-largest producer with output of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) before the revolution, Libya's oil output slumped to just 150,000 bpd in May 2014. Output is now about 1.1 million bpd, according to Reuters estimates.

As the backbone of its economy, oil has been at the core of unrest that followed Gaddafi's overthrow, a slow-burn conflict with periodic flare-ups of intense fighting.

Factions have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands. Fields and ports in Libya's east were blocked between 2013 and 2016.

(GRAPHIC: Libya Oil Production - tmsnrt.rs/2HZznd2)

In 2016, Haftar seized most facilities in Libya's east and this year his forces swept through the south, taking control of the major El Sharara and El Feel oilfields.

Islamic State lost its Libyan stronghold of Sirte to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes at the end of 2016, but some of the facilities the militant group attacked remain unrepaired.

The simple answer is the National Oil Corporation (NOC), headquartered in Tripoli. It is the sole entity controlling oil and gas field operations and the only marketer of Libyan crude abroad.

But since 2014, the picture has been complicated by competition between rival governments based in Tripoli and the eastern city of Benghazi.

Most of Libya's oil infrastructure is in the east where competition for control has raged between military factions.

Haftar's LNA controls eastern oil ports and oilfields but has technically left NOC to run them as major foreign buyers of oil only want to deal with the state-run firm.

NOC has condemned the militarization of Libya's energy infrastructure.

The LNA said last week it had sent a warship to the eastern Ras Lanuf oil port.

(GRAPHIC: Libya Oil Exports by Terminal - tmsnrt.rs/2I85yqW)

Even as the LNA grew more powerful in the east and then swept south, oil revenue still flowed to the central bank in Tripoli. Those earnings climbed 80 percent to $24.5 billion in 2018.

The central bank distributes funds including public salaries across the country, but factions in the east say they have received less than their fair share, accusing the Tripoli central bank of favoritism and corruption. The bank denies this.

As oil production fluctuated, living standards have fallen steeply. Eastern factions in particular have struggled for funding, printing banknotes in Russia and selling bonds worth more than $23 billion.

The NOC in Tripoli has tried to stay above the political fray. But the eastern government, allied to the LNA, set up a parallel NOC in Benghazi that has repeatedly tried and failed to wrest control over some of Libya's oil exports.

The NOC in Tripoli has also struggled to secure funds to repair aging infrastructure and its facilities have suffered from regular power outages amid the political turmoil.

No. Companies based in countries with key roles in Libya's conflict either have active stakes in its oil and gas industry or are eyeing future investments.

Italy's Eni and Total of France have joint ventures with the NOC in Tripoli, but their governments have been sharply at odds over policy toward Libya.

The UAE is the biggest backer of Khalifa Haftar, a key figure and commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) force, which this month took control of two oilfields in Libya's south, El Sharara and the nearby El Feel facility.

The LNA has called on state oil firm NOC to reopen the 315,000 barrel-a-day El Sharara field which has been closed since state guards and tribesmen seized it in December to make financial demands.

But NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla on Sunday rejected the LNA's demands, saying El Sharara was not secure because the gunmen who had seized it were still present.

It was not clear whether Haftar would travel to the UAE as his office could not be reached for comment.

Apart from Sanalla, the Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj confirmed he would attend, his spokesman said on Twitter.

U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame and U.S. diplomats will also be attending, sources said.

NOC said in a statement Sanalla would meet unidentified Libyan players to ""discuss security measures necessary to find a solution to the Sharara crisis, that guarantee staff safety, and pave the way for the lifting of force majeure at the field.""

Force majeure is a contractual waiver declared by NOC in December when it shut down production at El Sharara, located deep in Libya's south hit by insecurity.

Serraj heads the internationally recognized government based in Tripoli which opposes a parallel administration based in the east allied to Haftar, who is also based there. Sanalla is based in Tripoli like Serraj but has sought to keep NOC out of the conflict of the two governments.

The U.N. has been mediating between the two camps to overcome divisions and prepare elections but has had little progress. Salame's plan to hold a national conference to decide on the format of elections has met resistance of Haftar's supporters who feel emboldened by recent military progress.

The LNA started in January a campaign to secure oilfields and fight militants in the south, expanding his territory claim much beyond the east which it controls.

""The field is closed because of the presence of a group of civilians, this armed militia, and some military people with them,"" Mustafa Sanallah said in the video posted online.

""The field is not yet safe,"" he said.

He said NOC was in contact with the Libyan National Army (LNA) force which took control of the field this month.

11401613,2019-10-17,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Gunmen raided two trendy seafront cafes in the Libyan capital Tripoli this month to banish unmarried couples and impose strict religious codes, witnesses said, in a move that has alarmed civil liberties defenders.

The identity of the armed men has not been confirmed, but the episode appears to reflect the rise of Islamist currents, including hardline Salafism, in some of the powerful armed groups that the authorities rely on to keep order.

The raids, the latest of several incidents in eastern and western Libya to worry human rights advocates, add a fresh layer of uncertainty to a city under assault by an eastern-based force that aims to win power nationally.

Both cafes targeted are in the upscale Hay Andalus neighborhood, just west of central Tripoli.

At one, Eleanor, ""a group of armed men stormed the cafe with their guns and started questioning the men, to see if they were accompanied by a woman who was a close relative, or by a friend,"" on Oct. 6, a witness said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

""Men who were sitting with (female) friends were taken out of the cafe by the armed group ... they took them into their vehicles for a couple of minutes then released them,"" the witness said. ""The men came in again to pay the bills and left.""

At another cafe on the same seafront stretch, more than 30 masked, armed men in military uniform swept in one morning earlier this month, said a witness.

The armed men asked to see marriage certificates, telling women they had to be accompanied by their husband or a brother. ""I was very scared,"" the witness said. ""After five minutes the cafe was empty. Even the men left.""

The gunmen said they wanted the family section of the cafe - designed for women and their relatives but also frequented by some single women and couples - shut down.

""They said the next time, if we find something like this, we're going to close it,"" said the witness.

At least two other cafes nearby put messages on Facebook saying they would no longer admit unmarried couples or single men, despite there being no law against such mixing in Libya.

On social media the raids sparked a wave of criticism against the Special Defence Force (SDF), Tripoli's most powerful Salafist-leaning group, which has modeled itself as the capital's primary anti-crime and counter-terrorism force.

An SDF spokesman denied the force had stormed cafes in Hay Andalus. The Nawasi brigade, another armed group, which is also Salafist leaning, could not be reached for comment.

The two armed groups are among several which patrol Tripoli at the behest of Libya's internationally-recognized government, which is based in the capital and competes with eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar to establish national control.

Tripoli's armed groups are nominally under the interior ministry but retain broad autonomy.

The groups also help defend the city from a six-month-old assault by Haftar, who says he seeks to bring Tripoli's militias to heel and rid western Libya of radical Islamists. Haftar's forces also include Salafists within their ranks.

The cafe raids showed that armed groups could still act with impunity in Tripoli, said a women's rights activist, who asked not to be named for fear her comments would be politicized.

They also reflected a backlash by religious radicals against the increasing presence of women in public spaces, she said. ""They really want to push back women to their houses and to stop these social changes happening.""

11401616,2019-05-18,"BENGHAZI (Reuters) - Two guards and a soldier were killed and four other people were kidnapped early on Saturday in a suspected Islamic State attack targeting Libya's Zella oilfield, a security source said.

The death toll was confirmed by the National Oil Company (NOC) which condemned the attack in a statement on Saturday evening.

The attackers struck at an entrance gate to the field, which lies near the town of Zella about 760 km (470 miles) southwest of the capital, Tripoli, before fleeing, according to the source and local residents who asked not to be named.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack through its Aamaq news agency later on Saturday.

The Zella field belongs to Zueitina Oil Company, which pumped 19,000 barrels per day on average in the last quarter of 2018 across all its fields.

An engineer told Reuters workers at the field were safe and facilities had not been damaged.

Libya's NOC chief said on Saturday continued instability in the country could cause it to lose 95 percent of oil production.

Speaking in Saudi Arabia ahead of a ministerial panel gathering on Sunday of top OPEC and non-OPEC producers, Mustafa Sanalla also confirmed the Zella attack.

Islamic State has been active in Libya in the turmoil since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The militant group took control of the coastal city of Sirte in 2015 but lost it late in 2016 to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes.

In the last two years, the group has targeted three state institutions in Tripoli, home of the U.N.-backed government of national accord led by Prime Minister Fayez Serraj.

11401618,2019-04-27,"TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan military forces have sent a war ship to the eastern oil port of Ras Lanuf, their spokesman said on Saturday, the first confirmed use of an oil facility since the start of their military operation to seize the capital Tripoli.

Libyan National Army (LNA) forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, and which are allied to a parallel government in the east, started an offensive three week ago to take the capital held by the internationally recognized government.

LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told reporters his forces had sent the Alkarama patrol vessel to Ras Lanuf in Libya's key Oil Crescent region as part of a ""training mission"" to visit the operations room and to secure oil facilities.

The LNA controls Ras Lanuf and other eastern oil ports and the county's oilfields but had technically left state firm NOC to run them. NOC is based in Tripoli and has sought to stay out of the conflict between the two governments, handling the oil and gas exports, Libya's lifeline.

The export proceeds are given by NOC to the Tripoli central bank which mainly works with the Tripoli government but also pays some public servants in LNA-controlled eastern Libya.

NOC in a statement on Saturday condemned the use of its facilities for military purposes without mentioning the LNA or naming who was behind the acts.

""Incidents recorded by NOC include: The seizure of the Es Sider airstrip for military use, military personnel entering the port of Es Sider as well as attempts to requisition NOC tug boats, the berthing of warships in the Ras Lanuf terminal and its use by Libyan military vessels.""

""NOC strongly condemns the militarization of Libyan national energy infrastructure,"" it added.

The NOC also said revenues rose to more than $1.5 billion in March, up 20 percent from the previous month, but that fighting posed a serious threat to production.

The $270 million rise in revenue was mainly due to the ending of a three-month armed blockade at the south-western oilfield of Sharara

But fighting around Tripoli puts future output at risk.

11401619,2019-01-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Libya's biggest oilfield, El Sharara, will remain shut until an armed group occupying the site leaves, the head of National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Tuesday, more than a month after the field closed because of a protest.

""The armed group attempting to hold NOC and Libya's economic recovery to ransom must leave the field before NOC will consider restarting production,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told a Chatham House conference in London.

The field was producing as much as 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) ahead of its closure, but it has lost 13,000 bpd of capacity since last month due to security breaches, Sanalla told reporters on the sidelines of the event.

The oilfield has been under force majeure since December. Before the nation plunged into conflict in 2011, the site had the capacity to produce 340,000 bpd.

OPEC member Libya is now producing just below 1 million bpd, Sanalla said, below average production in 2018 of 1.1 million bpd.

NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor.

Libya's oil industry has faced disruption since unrest began, with rival power centers in the west and east. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure.

General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which is based in the east, launched a campaign this month in southwest Libya that it says aimed to combat militant groups and secure oil facilities in the area, including El Sharara.

NOC is based in the capital Tripoli, in the country's west, home to the internationally recognized government.

Referring to the LNA initiative, Sanalla said the effort to restart the field ""has been complicated further by the launch of an international counter-terrorism mission which has expanded into an attempt to seize control of territory, including potentially, national oil infrastructure"".

""It is my concern that a sequence of events has been set in motion with unknowable consequences for Libya, and NOC,"" he said.

He said the preferred solution for securing the field involved deploying a Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG) force, managed by NOC, adding that NOC would adopt this option with ""some reluctance"".

Different factions of the PFG have previously been responsible for shutdowns at oil facilities.

He said NOC had suggested that, as an immediate measure, ""a mixed force might provide a solution within a negotiated security framework"" led by the Government of National Accord in Tripoli and with the support of the United Nations.",Reuters,energy,,"['London', 'Libya', 'Tripoli']",Libya's El Sharara oilfield won't reopen until occupiers leave: NOC,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-oil-idUSKCN1PN1V1,None,
11401903,2019-05-15,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)

LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Consumption concerns have kept oil prices under pressure since the middle of April, even as threats to production and seaborne exports multiply.

U.S. sanctions have slashed exports from Venezuela and Iran, Libya's production is threatened by renewed fighting, and tensions between Iran and the United States have ratcheted up.

But the consumption outlook is deteriorating, with global trade hit by the United States and China dispute and growth prospects in major emerging markets from Brazil to India and Turkey are downgraded.

Global manufacturing production is decelerating, new export orders are falling, air freight volumes are declining, and container throughput is down, the most recent monthly indicators for March and April show.

Policymakers insist the economy is in robust health, but financial markets are pricing in a quarter-point cut in U.S. interest rates before the end of the year, anticipating the Fed will take out insurance against a deeper slowdown.

Problems are especially acute in emerging markets, where the MSCI emerging markets equity index is down 9% compared with the same period last year (tmsnrt.rs/2E8z4sY).

The decline in the MSCI emerging markets index is an improvement on the 17% drop at the end of December, but still the worst since the 2015/16 commodity slump.

Major emerging markets, which have provided much of the growth in oil consumption in the last two decades, are beset by economic problems:

* Brazil has downgraded its growth forecasts and the economy may have shrunk in the first quarter (""Brazil government, central bank, nod to rapidly deteriorating GDP, fiscal position"", Reuters, May 14).

* Argentina's inflation rate is accelerating, and the IMF predicts the economy will shrink this year (""How Argentina crept to the threshold of crisis again"", Reuters, May 1).

* Turkey's economy is forecast to contract amid rising tensions with the United States (""Turkish finance minister hopes damage to economy from currency crisis will be short-lived"", Reuters, May 12).

* India's economy is also losing momentum with an expectation the country's central bank will have to cut interest rates (""Next government seen relying on RBI rate cuts to spur growth"", Reuters, May 15).

* China's economy is being battered by higher tariffs imposed by the United States as part of the bilateral dispute between the two countries (""China's retail sales growth slumps to 16-year low"", Reuters, May 15).

* Iran's economy is shrinking, Saudi Arabia's growth is predicted to decelerate, and the United Arab Emirates will continue to grow slowly, according to the IMF (""World Economic Outlook"", April 9).

Compounding the problem, oil prices are still high in many formerly fast-growing emerging economies because of the strong dollar compared to their own currencies, which is also weighing on demand.

As a result, fuel consumption is growing more slowly or in some cases falling in some key markets, the latest national statistics show.

Brazil's gasoline sales have been falling steadily for 18 months but the decline accelerated sharply in March, while diesel sales, which had been growing, also dropped unexpectedly.

India's gasoline consumption was up by almost 8% between February and April compared with the same period a year earlier, but that was a sharp slowdown from 11% growth at this point in 2018.

India's total consumption of petroleum products is now rising at an annual rate of around 3%, down from more than 6% in August 2018.

Against the backdrop of a struggling global economy, oil consumption is likely to increase more slowly this year than in 2018 or 2017, and prices will struggle to rise.

If oil prices do spike higher as a result of further production disruptions, the increased burden on already weakened emerging economies will cause consumption growth to slow even more sharply.

11401999,2019-12-25,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan paid a surprise visit to Tunisia on Wednesday to discuss cooperation for a possible ceasefire in neighboring Libya, where Ankara supports the internationally recognized government.

Erdogan, speaking at a joint news conference with Tunisia's President Kais Saied, also reaffirmed Ankara's willingness to send troops to Libya if it received such a request.

Erdogan's visit to Tunis came a month after Turkey and Libya signed two separate accords, one on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean and another on security and military cooperation.

Turkey backs Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been fending off a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces in eastern Libya.

Erdogan, the first head of state to visit Tunis since Saied's landslide election win in October, said the developments in Libya were having a negative impact on neighboring states, including Tunisia.

""We discussed the possible steps we can take and cooperation opportunities with the aim of establishing ceasefire in Libya as soon as possible and returning to a political process,"" Erdogan said.

In Tunisia's hybrid political system, the prime minister controls most policy areas, while the president is in charge of foreign affairs, defense and security. Tunisia's main foreign policy interests have traditionally been in maintaining strong ties with its two much larger neighbors Algeria and Libya.

Last week, Erdogan said Turkey would not remain silent in the face of ""mercenaries"" such as the Russian-backed Wagner, a group of private military contractors, supporting Haftar's forces in Libya. Moscow has said it is very concerned about the prospect of Turkish troops being deployed there.

On Wednesday, Erdogan reiterated that Turkey would evaluate the option of deploying troops if the GNA asked for support after signing the military agreement, and added that the Wagner group had ""no connections, nothing"" in Libya.

""Until today, we have never been unwanted guests anywhere, but if a call is made then we will surely evaluate it and take steps,"" Erdogan said. ""Serraj is the GNA's premier. We are taking steps with him. Haftar has no such title.""

On Tuesday Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey's parliament was working on a draft bill that would allow troop deployment to Libya.

Turkey has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report seen by Reuters last month. Haftar, meanwhile, has received support from Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

Turkey and Russia have been cooperating in the search for a political solution to Syria's eight-year war, even though they back opposing sides. They also have strong ties in defense and trade.

Erdogan's visit to Tunis comes as Turkey ramps up efforts to strike deals with nations around the Mediterranean, where Ankara has been at loggerheads with Greece over resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus.

Athens was outraged by the agreement signed by Turkey and the GNA last month mapping out maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.

The deal between Ankara and Tripoli carves out a corridor of maritime boundaries between Libya and Turkey, potentially clearing the way for oil and gas exploration there.

Greece, which is a close ally of Israel and is at odds with Turkey over a host of issues, called the accord absurd because it ignored the presence of the Greek island of Crete between the coasts of Turkey and Libya.

The Israeli government had previously made no public comment on the accord, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Greece next week to solidify plans with Greece and Cyprus to build a subsea pipeline to export gas from Israel to Europe.

Nicosia said that Netanyahu had told Cyprus' president last Friday that the maritime deal was to be condemned as ""illegal"".

""Those that signed it do not have any legal authority to do so, since the government itself was rejected. It did failed a confidence vote twice and has not been legally sworn in at the House of Representatives,"" Issa told reporters in Athens through an interpreter.

Greece had asked Libya for details of the deal last week.

""The text of this agreement carries the signature of the Libyan foreign minister. It is the same person who, in September, had assured the Greek side otherwise,"" Dendias said.

Off-shoots of the group that advocates peaceful protest as a way to pile on pressure to curb global warming are sprouting from Beirut to Doha, as activists in the oil-rich region want governments to ditch fossil fuels for renewable energy sources.

""Governments are not going to do anything unless they see that people themselves want that change - that's how any movement starts,"" said Iman, a member of the newly formed Extinction Rebellion (XR) group in Qatar who declined to give her full name for security reasons.

""There's a very large number of Qataris who are very passionate about sustainability and who want to see change implemented but they also acknowledge the challenges to it - whether that be political or simply cultural,"" she said.

The gas-rich Gulf State, with a population of about 2.7 million, emits more carbon dioxide per person than any other nation globally, according to World Bank data, while across the region, countries suffer blistering heat and water shortages.

As host of the 2022 football World Cup, Qatar is looking at ways to reduce carbon emissions linked to the event and execute a 2030 national plan to curb its carbon footprint.

Extinction Rebellion launched in London in 2018, inspiring waves of disruptive action around the world pushing for rapid cuts in carbon emissions, with the protests leading to thousands of arrests.

In Qatar - a country where protests are illegal - the nascent group acknowledges it will not be able to carry out large-scale civil disobedience like other XR groups.

But Iman said the plan is to change hearts and minds through public advertising campaigns and lobbying decision-makers.

""It's a little harder to be more vocal about issues such as sustainability, especially when you're in an oil-rich region,"" said the 19-year-old student. ""There are constraints.""

Despite a social emphasis on consumer culture, she said, there is growing public awareness in Qatar around waste - and a willingness by young people especially to shoulder more responsibility for the global climate crisis.

Water scarcity and desertification are major climate issues in the Middle East and North Africa, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned earlier this year.

In Israel and the Palestinian territories, green activists said a 2018 report by the U.N. climate science panel - which said heat-trapping emissions must be slashed 45% by 2030 to keep warming to a lower agreed limit - had spurred them to join XR.

""We see ourselves as the noise-makers - the ones who are saying no more business as usual,"" Michael Raphael, a member of XR Israel, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Globally, XR tactics centre on civil disobedience such as blocking planes at a London airport and disrupting traffic outside Belgium's Royal Palace, while in New York activists glued themselves to a green sailboat parked in Broadway.

In politically tense places like Jerusalem, survival is an everyday concern, said Raphael, but a warming climate may inadvertently unite factions and help bring peace.

""It doesn't matter if you're Palestinian or Jewish - you're going to face the same difficulties under climate change,"" he said. ""If we don't take this on together, we're going to die together.""

Raphael and his group are most concerned about the development of off-shore gas rigs, water shortages, pesticides and over-fishing in the region, he added.

""There needs to be a big push for more systematic change.""

So far, local XR members have glued themselves to the windows of the Israeli stock exchange, blockaded petrochemical factories and protested outside government buildings.

In recent weeks, Lebanon has been paralyzed by an unprecedented wave of protests against what is seen as rampant corruption among its ruling elite, which led to the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri.

""The mass protests erupted and are kind of doing our job... so we're participating in them,"" said Rami Suleiman, co-founder of XR Lebanon.

A rise in temperatures exacerbated forest fires in the country, a contributing factor to voter frustration over wider government inaction, he added.

""Climate change actually played a huge role in starting these protests,"" he said by telephone. ""In the Middle East, we're suffering a lot from rising sea levels and changing weather patterns - so I got drawn in.""

The university student set up a Lebanese XR branch in May, after watching the movement grow abroad and feeling ""astonished"" the region had nothing similar.

The group, now around 40-strong, has translated climate documents into Arabic, disrupted traffic flows and lately participated in the broader political protests in Beirut.

In Turkey too, the climate movement is growing, with an XR group in Istanbul and others planned in Ankara, Bodrum and Izmir, said Elif Unal, an XR coordinator in the country.

""I was very anxious about the climate crisis and I was feeling very hopeless,"" said 25-year-old Unal, who first got involved by translating XR tweets into Turkish.

The group has since put on art shows and performances in central Istanbul to grab public attention.

They are seeking to use more cautious and creative methods than in other European cities, she said, not least because ""getting arrested is not something new in Turkey"" and would be a less effective tactic.

Governments across the Middle East are grappling with how to slow down climate change and cope with its impacts.

Officials are eager to demonstrate their countries can be effective stewards of the environment, despite their heavy reliance on fossil fuels.

Dubai, Muscat and Doha, for example, are developing low-carbon residential areas that aim to reduce emissions and serve as green living models.

Yet while all countries in the region are signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle global warming, six states - Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Turkey and Yemen - have yet to ratify the international accord, meaning they are not legally bound by it.

Unal said there was a tendency in the region to blame other parts of the world, such as Europe and the United States, for causing climate change.

11402011,2019-06-28,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar will ban any commercial flights from Libya to Turkey and Turkish ships from docking in the country, its spokesman Ahmed Mismari said on Friday.

Turkey supports Libya's internationally recognized government in Tripoli which on Wednesday dealt a blow to eastern forces trying to seize the capital in a three-month campaign.

Any aircraft arriving from Turkey attempting to land in the capital Tripoli would be treated as hostile, said Mismari. The same would apply to Turkish ships docking at Libyan ports.

He also said his Libyan National Army (LNA) force would attack any Turkish military presence, without elaborating.

Turkey has supplied drones and trucks to forces allied to Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, while the LNA has received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, according to diplomats.

The LNA, which is allied to a parallel government in the east, has failed to take Tripoli but it commands air superiority. It has several times attacked Tripoli's functioning airport.

Mismari also said his forces had lost 43 soldiers in the battle over the town of Gharyan which the Tripoli forces took on Wednesday.

Gharyan was the main forward base for the LNA where troops, weapons and ammunition arrived. The LNA began its Tripoli campaign there.

The LNA still holds the town of Tarhouna southeast of Tripoli, its second main position in the campaign.

Haftar and his backers say they are trying to free the capital from militias which they blame for destabilizing Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.

Haftar's critics accuse him of trying to seize power through force and deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and west of the sprawling North African country.

Haftar's offensive has upended United Nations-led plans to stabilize Libya after years of conflict that have left the oil-rich nation divided and caused living standards to plummet.

11402012,2019-06-17,"DAKAR (Reuters) - France has arrested a Chadian rebel leader along with two other people for alleged crimes against humanity, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Monday.

General Mahamat Nouri, who served as a minister under former President Hissene Habre and current President Idriss Deby, joined the armed opposition against Deby in 2006.

Nouri founded the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD) rebel coalition. He sought exile in France in 2010 after he was expelled from Sudan, where he had fled following a failed coup against Deby in 2008.

The Paris prosecutors office said in a statement to Reuters that it had investigated Nouri over ""acts committed in Chad and in Sudan between 2005 and 2010"", but provided no further details.

A collection of rebel groups, several of them based across the northern border in Libya, has repeatedly challenged Deby's rule, unnerving Western powers who see him as a bulwark in West Africa's turbulent Sahel region against Islamist militants.

In February, former colonial power France bombed Chadian rebels from the Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR) on Deby's request to stop an advance from southern Libya.

France also intervened in 2008 to stop UFDD and UFR rebels from toppling Deby, who came to power in 1990 at the head of an armed rebellion against Habre.

11402013,2019-06-10,"BEN GUERDANE, Tunisia (Reuters) - Standing in his one-room store between tables stacked with brightly colored t-shirts and jeans, Fathi Mars gestures in despair.

""If the war continues we will shut down,"" said the shopkeeper.

It's a common refrain in Ben Guerdane. The town in Tunisia's impoverished south has for decades served as an entrepot for goods, smuggled or imported, 35km across the border from Libya.

Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, however, conflict in the neighboring country has decimated business.

Around 700 stores have closed in the past eight years as supplies dwindled and prices soared, according to a local traders' association. The stalls' skeletal remains pockmark the town's streets -- rusting and buckled metal frames once heaving with goods for sale.

The financial fallout from Libya's war is another blow for Tunisia. The North African country helped inspire the broader Arab Spring uprisings with its overthrow of autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. But while Tunisians now have democracy, financially they are struggling.

The Tunisian economy shrank 13 percent between 2017 and 2011, according to World Bank data, and youth unemployment, which helped drive the revolution, is still among the highest in the region at around 35 percent.

Austerity measures, high inflation and the impact on tourism and foreign investment from periodic attacks by Islamist militants have taken a heavy toll, prompting protests in April in the central town of Sidi Bouzid, where the 2011 revolution started.

Libya used to act as a pressure valve for the Tunisian economy, a place where thousands of Tunisians went for work each year and a source of cheap goods they could sell back home. But the violence has damaged the flow of products and people.

Ben Guerdane's so-called 'Souk Libya' - a labyrinth of low-slung stores selling clothes, televisions and microwaves, some still in boxes with the names of Libyan import firms -- has been under pressure for years. Its problems deepened after Khalifa Haftar, the commander of Eastern Libya forces, began an offensive in early April to take Tripoli from soldiers loyal to the internationally-recognized government.

The fighting nixed a trade deal between Tunisia and Libya which would have allowed travelers to import consumer goods worth 10,000 Libyan dinars ($7,140) to Tunisia, reversing the limits and arbitrary bans previously put on imports by armed groups and officials representing the Libyan state, traders and officials in Ben Guerdane said.

As officials were working out the details of the agreement, the Tripoli war broke out, putting talks on hold as western Libyan communities controlling the trade routes focused instead on fighting.

""The people of Ben Guerdane depend on what is happening on the other side of the border,"" said Fathi Abab, head of the city council, who was involved in the trade negotiations. ""We agreed on a new deal but war broke out. It has not been implemented.""

Lacking the economic development of Tunisia's northern tourist regions, the south of the country is a popular recruiting ground for Islamist militants. In 2016, they tried to seize Ben Guerdane with the help of homegrown jihadists but were thwarted by Tunisian security forces.

Most adults in the ramshackle town of 100,000 don't have a regular job, according to a local labor union and without income from trading, tensions rise. When Libya closed the main Ras Jdir crossing into the country for more than two months last year, Ben Guerdane residents demonstrated.

""If border economies further deteriorate without the creation of alternative livelihoods, further protests in border regions are certain, as we have seen repeatedly in the past few years,"" said Max Gallien, a political scientist who has researched cross-border trade and smuggling in North Africa.

""They are drawing on a rich and serious legacy of local grievances. It's important to take them seriously.""

Regionally, the renewed conflict in Libya threatens to disrupt oil supplies, drive increased migration across the Mediterranean to Europe, and scupper U.N. plans for an election to end rivalries between Libya's parallel administrations.

Tunisia is not the only country hurting economically. Egypt used to send workers to Libya while its southern neighbors Chad and Niger have also benefited in the past from trade and smuggling, according to Libyan businessmen.

Traditionally, Tunisian traders have been able to exploit a lucrative gap between high prices at home, where the government has been increasing taxes, and low prices in Libya, where little or no import duties or taxes are paid on goods, and food and fuel have been heavily subsidized.

But imports of goods into Tunisia have been in decline for more than three years as rival groups in Libya jostle for supremacy. Armed groups controlling the border and trade routes have imposed their own duties or banned supplies.

The Libyan dinar, under pressure from the conflict, nosedived in 2017 compared to the black market, driving up prices and prompting the central bank to devalue the exchange rate for commercial and private transactions the following year.

Traders in Ben Guerdane said the cost of importing items such as Turkish carpets and trousers made in China from Libya had doubled in the past three years

Tighter Tunisian border controls, designed to keep militants out, have also hit petrol smuggling networks, as has a campaign by Libya's state oil firm, NOC, to halt the illicit fuel trade. In addition, the Tripoli government last year stopped subsidizing food which made the smuggle of wheat and pasta less profitable.

Imports from Libya to Tunisia by land fell to 3,500 tonnes in April this year from 4,188 tonnes in April 2010, according to Tunisian customs data. These figures do not include the large volume of goods that are smuggled across the border.

Another measure of the drop in trade is the near halving of the number of people traveling across the border to 101,978 in April 2019 from April 2010, according to Tunisian statistics. Traders from Tunisia often go on day trips to Libya to do business.

In Ben Guerdane, Mars, the clothing retailer, has tried to replace Libyan goods with wares imported from Turkey, China and other East Asian countries but they are more expensive and don't fit the 'Souk Libya' model.

11402014,2019-04-29,"PARIS, France (Reuters) - The United Nations envoy for Libya on Monday warned countries tempted to continue backing eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar that he was no democrat and his political agenda was not supported by most Libyans.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which is allied to a rival administration in eastern Libya, mounted an offensive on the capital Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognized government, three weeks ago but has failed to breach defenses in the city's south despite heavy fighting.

The battle for the capital has all but wrecked U.N.-backed efforts for a peace deal between the rival factions and threatened to further disrupt OPEC member Libya's oil industry.

""He is no Abraham Lincoln, he is no big democrat, but he has qualities and wants to unify the country,"" Ghassan Salame told France Inter radio, referring in part to the revered 19th century U.S. president who led the nation through its Civil War, preserving the union, and abolished slavery.

""But how is he going to do it? Seeing him act, we can be worried about his methods because where he is governing, he doesn't govern softly, but with an iron fist.""

Salame, whose tone on Haftar appeared tougher than previously, is touring European capitals to try to secure a consensus for a ceasefire and a return to peace talks as Western and Arab countries remain divided over how to tackle Libya.

France has along with the United States been accused in Tripoli of playing both sides since Haftar launched his offensive. Paris has supported Haftar in his efforts to fight Islamist militants in Libya in the past, while at the same time officially backs the U.N.-recognized government.

France was criticized by analysts and diplomats earlier this month after blocking an European Union communique that it deemed was too one-sided against Haftar. The statement was eventually approved after additions and a rewording of the text, although it remained critical of Haftar's advance.

""I'm suffering from a very deep division at the U.N. Security Council that prevented a British draft to pass a resolution to stop the firing,"" Salame said, referring to a resolution blocked last week by Russia and the United States.

""The temptation of the strongman is widespread. The problem is that the strongman is perhaps not as strong as he seems and that's the dilemma for those who support him.""

Haftar's opponents in Libya see him as a budding new autocrat in the mould of Muammar Gaddafi, who was toppled by a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.

Salame was in France after visiting Italy, Libya's former colonial ruler, and he said Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had told him Paris was fully behind his efforts for a ceasefire.

""We cannot ignore the General Haftar phenomenon, but one must not go so far as to adopt his political project entirely because his political project is a project which does not suit a good part of the Libyan population,"" Salame said.",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'Paris', 'Tripoli', 'United States', 'France', 'Russia', 'United Kingdom']",'He's no Abraham Lincoln': Libya U.N. envoy warns against backing...,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-salame-idUSKCN1S5143,None,
11402015,2019-04-29,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - An armed group attacked Libya's largest oilfield on Monday, but was repelled after clashes with its protection force, while fighting escalated in eastern commander Khalifa Haftar's effort to capture the capital Tripoli.

The state oil company National Oil Corporation (NOC) said unknown gunmen fired a rocket propelled grenade at a control station of the El Sharara oilfield. Guards at the site eventually repelled the attackers, an oil engineer there told Reuters.

There were no casualties among oil workers and production was unaffected, the NOC said in a statement.

OPEC member Libya's oil output has been repeatedly disrupted by factional conflict and blockades since the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

Haftar's three-week-old offensive to seize Tripoli, seat of Libya's internationally recognized government, has sharpened a power struggle that has fractured Libya since Gaddafi's fall.

The assault by the Haftar-led Libyan National Army (LNA), which is allied to a parallel government based in the eastern city of Benghazi, stalled on Tripoli's stoutly defended southern outskirts last week.

But fighting intensified again on Monday, with both sides using artillery. Shelling was heard in the center of Tripoli coming from southern districts from morning until late at night, residents said.

The Tripoli forces as well as the LNA claimed to have made progress on different parts of the frontline though the situation remained fluid.

A prominent commander from Misrata, a western city allied to Tripoli, has died, the LNA and some websites affiliated with armed groups in Misrata said.

No official confirmation was immediately available.

The battle for Tripoli has killed at least 345 people, including 22 civilians, a World Health Organization official said on Monday. A hospital in Tripoli was evacuated after shelling shattered some windows, the official tweeted.

The United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR said 146 refugees, mainly Africans and a handful of Syrians, were evacuated on Monday from Libya to Italy, where their asylum claims will be processed. Most of them had been transferred earlier this month from detention centers near the fighting, a spokeswoman said.

But 3,300 migrants and refugees remain trapped in detention centers near the Tripoli clashes, the UNHCR said.

It was unclear who the gunmen who targeted El Sharara are affiliated with. The oilfield is in a southwestern region held by forces loyal to Haftar.

State guards and local tribesmen shut down El Sharara in December to press financial demands before allowing production to reopen in March.

The field, operated by the NOC and foreign partners, has been pumping crude only intermittently due to blockades mostly by armed groups and other incidents.

U.N. officials say Haftar is backed militarily by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which want to build him up to help fight and neutralize Islamist militants in the region. His opponents see him as a budding autocrat in Gaddafi's mold.

Divisions among European and Gulf nations over how to deal with Haftar have scuppered U.N. efforts to broker a ceasefire between the main factions to prepare Libya for elections to help reunify the North African country.

France and the United States been accused by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's government in Tripoli of playing both sides since Haftar launched his offensive. Paris has backed Haftar's efforts to curb radical Islamists while at the same time formally supporting Serraj's U.N.-recognized government.

Serraj is backed emphatically by Italy, the former colonial power that has oil assets in Libya, and Turkey. Qatar, a Gulf rival of the UAE, also supports Serraj.

The U.N. envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salame, warned nations tempted to continue supporting Haftar that he was no democrat and his political agenda was not favored by most Libyans.

""He is no Abraham Lincoln, he is no big democrat, but he has qualities and wants to unify the country,"" Salame told France Inter radio, referring to the U.S. president who steered his country through its Civil War, preserving the union and abolished slavery.

11402016,2019-02-05,"PARIS (Reuters) - Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said he met leaders of France's ""yellow vest"" anti-government movement on Tuesday, an encounter likely to further test already strained bilateral relations.

Di Maio, who also leads the populist, anti-establishment 5-Star party, said he had stopped over in France and met ""yellow vests"" leader Christophe Chalencon and candidates on the grassroots movement's list for European Parliament elections in May.

""The winds of change have crossed the Alps"", Di Maio said on Twitter. He has previously expressed support for the movement.

The at time violent ""yellow vests"" protests have been a political thorn in President Emmanuel Macron's side since November as support among the French electorate for his reform agenda has ebbed.

11402017,2019-01-22,"ROME (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, stoking a war of words between Rome and Paris, said on Tuesday that France did not want to bring calm to Libya because its energy interests there clashed with those of Italy.

Relations between Italy and France, traditionally close allies, have grown frosty since the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement formed a coalition last year and took aim at pro-EU French President Emmanuel Macron.

France's Foreign Ministry and the French president's office declined to respond immediately.

On Monday France summoned Italy's ambassador after Salvini's fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, accused Paris of creating poverty in Africa and generating mass migration to Europe.

Salvini backed up Di Maio, saying France was looking to extract wealth from Africa rather than helping countries develop their own economies, and pointed particularly to Libya, which has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew strongman Muammar Gaddafi.

""In Libya, France has no interest in stabilising the situation, probably because it has oil interests that are opposed to those of Italy,"" Salvini told Canale 5 TV station.

A French diplomatic source said it was not the first time that Salvini had made such comments and that it was probably because he felt he had been upstaged by Di Maio.

The source added that the accusation was baseless and reiterated that French efforts in Libya were aimed at stabilising the country, preventing the spread of terrorism and curbing the migration flows.

Italy's Eni and France's Total have separate joint ventures in Libya, but Eni's CEO Claudio Descalzi denied in a newspaper interview last year that there was any conflict between the two firms in the north African state.

Salvini is head of the League, while Di Maio leads 5-Star. Both are campaigning hard for European parliamentary elections in May and are eager to show they have broken with the consensual politics of centre-left and centre-right parties.

The two men have repeatedly targeted neighbouring France and accused Macron of doing nothing to help handle the hundreds of thousands of mainly African migrants who have reached Italy from Libya in recent years.

Asked about the latest diplomatic spat with Paris, Salvini said on Tuesday: ""France has no reason to get upset because it pushed away tens of thousands of migrants (at the French border), abandoning them there as though they were beasts. We won't take any lessons on humanity from Macron.""

A French presidential source said populist forces in Italy and elsewhere were looking to undermine countries like France and Germany which wanted to strengthen the European Union.

The aircraft was seized in the western city of Misrata, east of the capital Tripoli, after it flew there for maintenance from Benghazi's Benina airport.

The carrier's Benghazi spokesman, Ezzedine al-Mashnoun said the only plane operated by Libyan Airlines - Benghazi Administration was seized during maintenance.

Mashnoun said the incident was causing serious disruption to the flight schedule. The plane operates three flights to international destinations daily.

""The problem was fixed by the company's engineers at Misrata airport and after preparing the plane for take-off, it was stopped by Hussain Ballaou, the assistant manager of Misrata airport,"" the carrier said in a statement on Facebook.

A spokesman for the eastern-based Libyan administration said the authorities in eastern Libya have given Misrata airport hours to return the plane or ""they must take responsibility for other escalatory measures in their airspace.""

Authorities from the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Misrata and Tripoli were not immediately available for comment.

Libya has been split between rival camps based in Tripoli and the east since 2014, a result of the divisions that surfaced when Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in a NATO-backed uprising three years earlier.

The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) force, led by Khalifa Haftar, launched an offensive in April for control of the capital and has been battling forces aligned with the Tripoli government.

On Thursday, eastern Libyan authorities had forced a civilian flight to land for security checks soon after it had taken off from the western city of Misrata.

The 90-minute stoppage of this Libyan Airlines flight underlined the warring sides' competition for control of Libya's institutions and infrastructure - part of a rift that has frustrated U.N.-led peace efforts.

11402071,2019-09-19,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, whose overthrow in a 2011 uprising triggered the ""Arab Spring"" revolutions, died in exile in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, days after a free presidential vote in his homeland.

His funeral will take place on Friday in Saudi Arabia, his family lawyer, Mounir Ben Salha, told Reuters.

""It is the end of dictators like him. We cannot forget that he destroyed our country ... he gave orders to kill civilians in protests in 2011,"" said Imad Layouni, an unemployed 26-year-old in a Tunis coffee shop.

Ben Ali fled Tunisia in January 2011 as his compatriots - many of them angered after a vegetable seller set himself on fire a few weeks earlier in protest at the police - rose up against his oppressive rule in a revolution that inspired other uprisings in the Middle East and led to a democratic transition at home.

On Sunday, they voted in an election that featured candidates from across the political spectrum, sending two political outsiders through to a second round vote unthinkable during Ben Ali's two decades in power.

However, while Tunisians have enjoyed a much smoother march to democracy than citizens of the other Arab states that also rose up in 2011, many of them are economically worse off than they were under Ben Ali.

While almost all the candidates in Sunday's election were vocal champions of the revolution, one of them, Abir Moussi, campaigned as a supporter of Ben Ali's ousted government, receiving 4% of the votes.

""It is a sign of the intolerance in country, which claims to be a democracy, that he died in Saudi Arabia,"" said Salwa Riahi, a doctor in Tunis.

A former security chief, Ben Ali had run Tunisia for 23 years, taking power when, as prime minister in 1987, he declared president-for-life Habib Bourguiba medically unfit to rule.

In office, he sought to stifle any form of political dissent while opening up the economy, a policy that led to rapid growth but also fueled grotesque inequality and accusations of brazen corruption, not least among his own relatives.

During that era, his photograph was displayed in every shop, school and government office from the beach resorts of the Mediterranean coast to the impoverished villages and mining towns of Tunisia's hilly interior.

On the few occasions his rule was put to the vote, he faced only nominal opposition and won re-election by more than 99%.

On Sunday, by contrast Tunisians chose between 26 candidates including both Ben Ali's own former supporter Moussi and an ex-political prisoner running for the Islamist Ennahda party, which he banned.

Ben Ali's rise began in the army after Bourguiba won Tunisia's independence from France in 1956. He was head of military security from 1964, and of national security from 1977.

After a three-year stint as ambassador to Poland, he was called back to his old security job in 1984 to quell riots over bread prices. Now a general, he was made interior minister in 1986 and prime minister in 1987.

It took him less than three weeks to arrange a new promotion to the top job, bringing in a team of doctors to declare Bourguiba senile, meaning he would automatically take over as head of state.

His first decade as president involved a big economic restructuring - backed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - and an annual growth rate slightly over 4% a year.

Wedged between Muammar Gaddafi's Libya and an Algeria thrust into civil war between the army-backed government and Islamist militants, Ben Ali's Tunisia followed the post-independence path of secularism and openness to the outside.

But within, critics said it was a police state where few dared challenge an all-powerful government. In a country where many had experienced life under democracy elsewhere, Ben Ali's oppressive state was reason to chafe.

Meanwhile, the elite were accumulating wealth in their extravagant seaside villas. The lavish lifestyle of Ben Ali's wife, Leila Trabelsi, and her clique of rich relatives, came to symbolize the corruption of an era.

Out in the provinces, in the shabby towns of the south and the rural villages without running water, anger was growing, leading to a small protest movement in 2008, sometimes called ""the little revolution"".

Eight years on from the real uprising, life is still tough in those areas, with unemployment higher than in 2010 and public services seeming to have deteriorated.

Tunisians often complain that living standards have dropped since the revolution, and speak of life under Ben Ali as more materially comfortable. But few speak with nostalgia of his style of rule, or say they want an end to democracy.

For Ben Ali, the sudden end came when a desperate vegetable seller in the humble town of Sidi Bouzid set himself alight in December 2010 after police confiscated his barrow.

Mohammed Bouazizi's funeral was attended by tens of thousands of furious people, sparking weeks of ever bigger protests in which scores of people were killed.

By mid January 2011, Ben Ali had had enough, and boarded a plane for Saudi Arabia.

11402072,2019-09-10,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - A German captain who defied Italy's ban on boats bringing migrants ashore said on Tuesday she was determined to carry on rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean, even though her ship Sea-Watch 3 remains impounded in an Italian port.

Carola Rackete, in Barcelona to receive an award from the Catalan parliament for her rescue missions, also urged the European Union to agree on a policy for redistributing migrants around the bloc to help relieve the pressure on Italy.

""We are definitely willing (to continue rescuing migrants) and there's a full crew on board ready to sail at any point ... I think it's a very, very important duty to rescue people in maritime distress,"" Rackete, 31, told Reuters.

Sea-Watch 3 is currently detained in the Italian port of Lucata. In June, Rackete piloted the vessel into port on the Italian island of Lampedusa with 41 migrants aboard despite efforts by the then-interior minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League, to stop her.

Rackete was arrested in Lampedusa and accused of endangering lives by barging into port but a judge threw out the accusations and freed her from house arrest. She still faces possible charges of aiding illegal immigration and defying official orders.

""We are very hopeful that even if it comes to a court case our state of necessity will justify our entering the port,"" she said, speaking in English.

Unknown numbers of mostly African illegal migrants have drowned in recent years while attempting to cross the Mediterranean by boat from Libya to Italy in search of a better life in Europe.

Italy welcomed in almost all of the migrants rescued by humanitarian groups at sea until a populist coalition government took office in 2018 and immediately sought to close the nation's ports to the charity ships.

Rackete called for a European solution to the problem.

""I would hope that there's an agreement of the European Union to transfer all the people that arrive in Italian ports"" to EU countries, she said. ""I hope then the Italian state would open the ports and allow people to disembark.""

Europe is ""responsible in many ways for what is happening in these countries"" after centuries of colonialism, Rackete said, adding that naval vessels should again be used to rescue migrants adrift on the Mediterranean.

Asked whether charity boats would no longer be needed with an EU-wide policy in place, she said: ""Definitely that would be what we are aiming for.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Barcelona', 'Italy', 'Lampedusa', 'Germany', 'Libya']",Captain who broke Italy's migrant ban says ready to rescue more...,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-rackete-idUSKCN1VV262,None,

Essebsi, who helped guide the North African country's transition to democracy after the 2011 revolution, died aged 92 on Thursday.

The state funeral is expected to start at 11 a.m. (1000 GMT). Those attending will also include Algerian President Abdelkader Ben Saleh, Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, along with thousands of Tunisians.

Hundreds of women, men and children stood under a strong sun outside the military hospital where he died, and later watched as his coffin was taken to Carthage presidential palace under heavy security.

Many expressed respect for his role overseeing political reforms in the north African country after the overthrow of veteran autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.

Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring uprisings, with a new constitution, free elections and a coalition government of moderate Islamist and secular parties in a region otherwise struggling with upheaval.

A state funeral is expected on Saturday, and international leaders including French President Emanuel Macron will attend.

""It was a sad day with the loss of our President Essebsi,"" said Moncef Marzouki, a former president and one of Essebsi's most determined rivals.

""But I am also proud of this smooth transition. We are fortunate to be in an advanced path in democracy transition, we are moving to a state of law.""

A leading figure in the country's fortunes since 2011, Essebsi was hospitalized late last month for a week after suffering what authorities described as a severe health crisis.

""On Thursday morning, the President of the Republic died at the military hospital in Tunis...The burial ceremony will be announced later,"" a presidency statement said.

The speaker of parliament, Mohamed Ennaceur, said he would be the country's temporary president, in line with the constitution. In a speech on national television, Ennaceur also called for unity following Essebsi's passing.

The prime minister declared seven days of national mourning. A source said Ennaceur's swearing in would take place at 1300 GMT.

Essebsi had been a prominent politician in Tunisia since the overthrow of veteran autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, which was followed by uprisings against authoritarian leaders across the Middle East, including in nearby Libya and Egypt.

Drafted in as prime minister in 2011 after Ben Ali was toppled, Essebsi was elected president three years later, becoming the country's first directly elected head of state after its ""Arab Spring"" uprising.

Parliamentary elections are expected to be held on Oct. 6 with a presidential vote following on Nov. 17. They will be the third set of polls in which Tunisians have been able to vote freely following the 2011 revolution.

The presidency statement called on Tunisians to unite and safeguard their country's present and future.

""After the revolution, the president led the people to avoid confrontation and led the democratic transition and was keen to build and complete the constitutional institutions,"" it said.

Analyst Ibrahim Ouslati said the death of Essebsi, one of the world's oldest leaders, was not likely to disrupt politics.

""I don't think there will be any problem because Tunisians have a constitution that clearly shows that the speaker of the parliament occupies the position temporarily,"" he said.

""Politically, there will be no problem. The political elite has enough awareness to manage it wisely like any democratic country.""

Tunisia has been hailed as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring uprisings, with a new constitution, free elections and a coalition government with secular and moderate Islamists in a region otherwise struggling with upheaval.

But political progress has not been matched by economic advances. Unemployment stands at about 15 percent, up from 12 percent in 2010, due to weak growth and low investment.

Essebsi's death comes at a time of fresh attempts to replace dictatorships with democracy in the Middle East.

The armed forces of neighboring Algeria and Sudan ousted long-serving rulers of those countries after mass protests. But it remains unclear whether greater freedoms will result.

Rached Ghannouchi, the influential leader of Tunisia's moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, said Essebsi was credited with leading a smooth transition to democracy by promoting inclusive politics.

Essebsi faced criticism that he was seeking a return to a strong state with power concentrated in the presidency, whose role is limited to foreign and defense policies under the new constitution.

Critics also accused Essebsi of attempting a dynastic handover, rowing back on post-revolution freedoms, and failing to support a truth commission seeking justice for the victims of authoritarian rule.

Tunisia has been spared much of the violence seen elsewhere in the Middle East since 2011, although it has been the target of militant Islamists over the years.

11402078,2019-06-20,"MISRATA, Libya (Reuters) - In a warehouse packed with rocket launchers, grenades and rifles in the Libya city of Misrata, workers sweat in the summer heat as they install an anti-aircraft gun on a pickup truck.

They are preparing to defend Tripoli, 200 km (125 miles) to the east, against military commander Khalifa Haftar, a self-proclaimed foe of Islamists who launched a surprise attack in April against a U.N.-backed government based in the capital.

Initially shocked by the audacity of Haftar's assault, armed groups in western Libya have improved coordination and revived armories from Libya's 2011 revolution against Muammar Gaddafi in order to equip their fighters.

Their early disarray allowed Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) force, allied to a parallel administration in eastern Libya, to reach Tripoli's southern outskirts.

But since then defenders drawn from Misrata and Tripoli have managed to hold off Haftar's attack, even regaining some turf.

Western diplomats expect a long war -- possibly until year-end -- as both sides seem confident of their prospects and enjoy backing from foreign powers who are not pushing for a ceasefire.

Such turmoil could disrupt oil flows and increase migration across the Mediterranean - a nightmare scenario for European countries: Libya has become the main conduit for African migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe.

For now, both sides seem intent on a military solution.

Turkey has supplied drones and armored trucks to Tripoli's defenders, diplomats and Tripoli officials say. This has helped balance out previous supplies by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates to LNA, they say.

Perhaps as important is the fighting spirit in Misrata, the main bastion against Haftar, where the largest mobilization is underway since 2011 when the city helped topple Gaddafi.

Thousands fighters have skipped their regular jobs to rush to the Tripoli front, supported by women cooking meals, rich businessmen and mechanics like Haj Sadoun and by his team of technicians.

""I started this workshop in 2011 during the revolution and have never stopped. I've developed the (weapons) skills since then,"" he said, standing in his warehouse. A dozen gun trucks were parked waiting to be served.

Some 10 trucks are serviced daily by workmen who repair their mounted guns or fix protective metal plates.

It's not only armed groups who support Sadoun -- a donation box at the entrance to his premises is used by businessmen and residents to keep him going.

His warehouse contains stockpiles of old guns looted from Gaddafi's arsenals and now stored for use as spare parts. Among the weapons lies an ammunition box that carries the name ""Jamahiriya"" -- a term used by Gaddafi for Libya.

Misrata's fighters make up the main force defending Tripoli, where armed groups are less organized and tend to have flexible loyalties: Major Tripoli groups have not fully mobilized against Haftar, apparently seeking to keep their options open.

Misratis say the Tripli groups lack the ""Misrata spirit"" developed in 2011 when Gaddafi besieged the city for three months. Misratis tend to see Haftar, an ex-general from Gaddafi's army, as a copy of the autocrat.

Misrata's troops already fought a war with Haftar in 2014 when the LNA flew air strikes to stop an advance of the city's force on Tripoli, held then by a government allied to Haftar.

This time Haftar, who seems himself as a bastion against Islamists, has not sent planes to bomb the Misrata's air, port and steel plant, which some diplomats take as sign he wants to make a deal with the Misratis in the end.

While the city is known for its armed groups and Islamists, it also home to businessmen, many of whom did well under the old regime -- it has Libya's biggest port, and steel and dairy firms serving the whole country.

Misrata is feeling the economic pinch: For example, foreign banks have become reluctant to open letters of credit for the steel plant, said its chairman Mohamed al-Faqih.

But this has not shaken his resolve. ""God willing we will finish the barbarian attack of the criminal Haftar,"" he said.

Other community leaders rule out peace talks with Haftar.

""With Haftar a deal is not possible anymore. Even if we lost 100,000 we would keep fighting,"" said Mohamed Raed, a lawmaker and chairman of the al-Nasseem dairy firm -- Tripoli fighters are supplied with his ice cream.

""We have more than 30,000 fighters in Misrata but so far we have sent only 6,000,"" he said.

For their part, diplomats estimate Tripoli's defenders at 3,000, similar to the dispatched LNA force. Only 1,000 are at the frontline, the rest are in forward bases, a diplomat said.

Both sides have rejected a ceasefire. Misrata officials say their forces will try take Tarhouna, a town southeast of Tripoli controlled by LNA. Haftar has been recruiting there.

""If Tarhouna is gone then Haftar lost the war,"" said Raed.

The LNA itself has strengthened positions near the central city of Sirte, controlled by Misrata.

11402079,2019-06-19,"FOUSSANA, Tunisia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Standing near the shrine of the Sufi saint Sidi Boughanem in western Tunisia, Karim points to the earth below his feet.

""There are stairs under the ground,"" he said. ""We started digging, but we had to stop because someone called the police.""

At the foot of a mountain covered with Roman villas and antique olive oil factories, the shrine sits atop buried structures and catacombs that date back to the Roman and Byzantine periods.

Archaeological sites such as this one in the region of Kasserine are often looted or damaged during illegal night-time excavations by people looking for goods to sell on, said Karim, a local historian from the nearby town of Foussana.

Then there are farmers who stumble across antiques by accident while planting crops, he added, and other people who go digging on their own land in the hope of finding artefacts they can sell.

Karim takes part in these digs out of curiosity. But his colleagues are hunting for treasures, he said.

""There are multiple groups (that do this),"" said Karim, whose name has been changed for his safety.

""It is happening almost on a daily basis.""

The looting of archaeological sites is a longstanding problem in Tunisia, said Yasser Jrad, head of the seized objects department at the National Heritage Institute (INP).

Objects of significant historical and cultural value often end up on the European market and in the homes of Tunisia's rich and powerful, he explained.

The issue was brought into the spotlight in 2011, when Tunisia's ousted autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, currently exiled in Saudi Arabia, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in the first of several trials for a range of crimes, including possession of archaeological artefacts.

In 2017, the Tunisian authorities seized a rare 15th-century Torah scroll that they thought was being smuggled to Europe.

More recently, in March customs seized 600 antique coins dating from the 2nd century from a car in the coastal town of Sfax.

Figures from the INP, which is tasked with protecting and recording the country's artefacts, show that the team has received more than 25,000 recovered archaeological items since the 2011 uprising.

Today, the INP gets more than double the number of reports for Kasserine than it did before the uprising, said Mohamed Ben Nejma, head of the region for the institute, adding that the instability and chaos of conflict often provides a window for archaeological looting.

But he also attributed the increase in recovered objects to the fact that the authorities are getting more serious about tackling the illicit antiquities trade.

""It might have been partly to do with state interests,"" said Jrad.

""Especially, since we discovered pieces stolen from our (national) sites in the houses of Ben Ali and his family.""

The western region of Kasserine, where the shrine of Sidi Boughanem is located, is one of the most marginalized parts of the country - with government figures showing about one in four people unemployed, far higher than the 15% unemployment rate for the country as a whole.

It is also one of the most archaeologically rich. There are four major sites located in an area of 8,000 square kilometers (3,000 square miles), and the land is peppered with architectural ruins and antique stones.

Bigger sites are guarded around the clock, according to the INP, while less significant sites have security guards during the day. But the sheer number of small sites makes it impossible to keep an eye on all of them, said Nejma.

Ridha Shili, an expert in national heritage promotion with the University of Tunis, said it is the lack of proper excavation projects and cultural investment in general that leaves the Kasserine region open to looting.

""It is kind of a virgin region,"" said Shili, pointing out that his hometown of Thala alone has about 350 archaeological sites.

""The state prefers for (these sites) to remain hidden because we don't have the means to protect them,"" he said.

When a new site is discovered, instead of guarding it or moving the artefacts to somewhere secure, ""the state documents it, they take photos and then they put the earth back over it"", Shili added.

As she surveys sites around Foussana for her research, Wafa Mouelhi, an archaeology masters student at the University of Tunis, takes pictures whenever she sees that someone has been digging.

""You see holes, you notice with the placement of stones that someone has been there,"" she said. ""People are looking for statues or gold and jewellery.""

Mouelhi and other residents inform the local authorities about illegal excavations. In January, she caught someone from the town attempting to dig up a mosaic and ceramics from a Roman site that contains a church.

Matthew Hobson of the UK-based Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and North Africa project, said multiple factors need to be taken into account when it comes to protecting heritage sites from theft, which is often driven by poverty and political instability.

""There are economic reasons (for looting),"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Tunis. ""The blame should not be put on the people who are trying to get by day-to-day, but the persons who are furnishing these collections.""

Unlike in Libya or Egypt, the antiquities trade in Tunisia is fairly small and disorganized, according to a local policeman, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his job.

""It's just pocket money, people sell things for less than they are worth,"" he said.

Abdelbaki Idoudi, a civil servant from Foussena, said the country's unprotected artefacts are fair game and that citizens have the right to benefit from rogue archaeological digs.

""The state left of all of (the artefacts) and doesn't look after them,"" he said. ""I'm for the practice because people can profit, it can help people get some money from their (heritage).""

Others, such as Ayoub Sayhi, a 22-year-old amateur filmmaker from Thala, called on the government to do more to care for the country's ancient objects.

To Sayhi, the looting of Kasserine's antiquities was just another symptom of what he saw as the state's neglect of the region.

""(My film) is to get the government to do something about this region because it is poor even though it is rich in natural resources,"" he said.

11402082,2019-06-05,"DOHA (Reuters) - Two years after flying in thousands of dairy cows to beat a trade embargo, Qatari milk producer Baladna has made its first exports.

Qatar is the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter but a net importer of nearly everything else. The small but wealthy country has been under a trade and transport boycott by Saudi Arabia and its allies since June 2017 that has forced it to retool an economy once heavily reliant on fellow Gulf states.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt accuse Qatar of supporting Islamist terrorist groups. Doha denies this and says the boycott, which closed its only land border and disrupted shipping routes, is an attempt to infringe on its sovereignty.

Baladna received its first cows a month after the boycott and set up a huge diary farm. It says it now supplies more than half of Qatar's fresh milk and is exporting to Afghanistan, Yemen and Oman, and soon to Libya.

Soon after the boycott was imposed, Doha developed new trade routes to replace its former Gulf partners. In late 2017 it opened a $7.4 billion port designed to become a regional transport hub.

Government officials say Baladna's rapid expansion shows the embargo has made Qatar's economy stronger. Their goal is to encourage local producers.

In April, Baladna rolled out a line of fruit juices. In Qatar's supermarkets, brands like Mazzraty, which opened the country's largest poultry plant in January, sit beside ""Qatar Farms"" displays of local fruit and vegetables.

Vegetable output is up about 20% since mid-2017 to around 66,000 tonnes per year and is expected to increase by 20,000-40,000 tonnes next year as new farms come online, said Sheikh Faleh Bin Naser Al Thani, an agriculture official at the Ministry of Municipality and Environment.

Qatar is now self-sufficient in dairy and fresh poultry. Before 2017 it produced only about 20% and 10% percent of its needs in those sectors, respectively.

""Qatar after June 5, 2017 is not like Qatar before,"" said Baladna communications director Saba al-Fadala, referring to the start of the boycott. ""We now don't want or need anyone.""

Schoolchildren tour the milking parlors of Baladna's farm, where 20,000 cows live in vast air-conditioned sheds. The visitors learn how flying in cows restored milk supplies that had been trucked in before Saudi Arabia closed the border.

But other sectors of Qatar's economy have suffered, with real estate and retail taking a hit. Shopping malls and hotels once filled with Saudi and UAE tourists at times appear nearly abandoned. Property prices fell sharply amid a supply glut in the run-up to Qatar hosting the World Cup 2022.

In March, Qatar Airways reported its second straight annual loss. Barred from the airspace of countries imposing the boycott, the state-owned carrier has had to re-route many flights, increasing their duration and cost.

At the same time, the boycott has forced Qatar to mount a public relations drive in the United States and Europe to counter claims by rivals that it finances terrorism.

It has also adopted a lower profile in the region after losing many of the bets it placed during the 2011 Arab Spring in Syria, Libya, and Egypt, where Qatar backed Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood.

But with a national population of just over 320,000 and a $320 billion sovereign fund, Qatar is well-placed to weather the embargo, diplomats and analysts say.

""If you are going to be subject to a blockade, then you better have a lot of money,"" one banker told Reuters.

In the early months of the crisis, Qatar liquidated nearly $3 billion in U.S. treasury investments and drew down over $40 billion in foreign reserves to support its currency and banks.

The economy has since stabilized, growing 2.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2018. Qatar's banks have been replenished by foreign deposits replacing much of the Saudi and Emirati money that left, and its stock market was the top performer in the Middle East last year.

Qatar's goal of greater food self sufficiency has required launching agriculture on a commercial scale in one of the world's harshest desert climates.

Nasser al-Khalaf, the managing director of Agrico, a produce grower and greenhouse manufacturer, says his business has boomed since he designed a system to keep fruit and vegetables cool enough to grow year-round.

In a polycarbon greenhouse, rows of ripening hydroponic tomatoes are cooled below 28 degrees Celsius as the temperature outside tops 40. Khalaf said the system allowed him to more than triple fruit and vegetable production to over 15 tonnes per day

Khalaf said his greenhouses are attracting investors looking at farming for the first time, drawn partly by increased subsidies for power, fertilizer and seeds since 2018.

""We never before saw businessmen investing in farms. They liked to invest in buildings and industry, anything but farms,"" said Sheikh Faleh, the Qatari official.

Rabban Agriculture is one of the new entrants.

Owner Al Rabban Holding - with investments in property, transport and bottled water - is tapping initiatives like a 1 million riyal ($275,000) collateral-free loan from Qatar's Development Bank to build a greenhouse farm, said deputy chairman Khalifa al-Rabban.

Qatari officials and diplomats said there was no sign of a let-up in the Gulf dispute, which has bolstered domestic support for 38-year-old ruler Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

This has allowed him to accelerate reforms requested by Western allies that would have previously have faced local opposition, such as wider labor rights and a liberalized investment code for foreign ownership.

The reforms are intended to position Qatar as ""like-minded with the Euro-U.S. community"", said a Western diplomat.

Doha pledged nearly $2 billion to expand Al-Udeid, the largest U.S. air base in the region. Qatar Petroleum aims to invest $20 billion in the United States, while the Qatar Investment Authority wants to expand its U.S. portfolio to $45 billion from $30 billion.

Nader Kabbani, director of research at Brookings Doha, said Qatar's tone had changed from initially wanting to resolve the dispute to asserting it can go it alone.

At least one pregnant woman and a number of children were believed to be among the 216 rescued migrants. Their nationality was not known.

An AFM spokesman said a patrol boat had been deployed to a sinking dinghy south of Malta on Friday. After picking up the migrants, it was diverted to a second dinghy while on its way to Malta, picking up those migrants as well.

The armed forces said that with good weather conditions prevailing, departures of migrants from Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria had increased in the past two days, resulting in 12 migrant boats arriving in Sicily, Sardinia, and Lampedusa.

11402085,2019-05-16,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's opposition alliance said on Thursday the ruling military council's 72-hour suspension of talks with protesters was a ""regrettable"" setback to efforts to forge a new democratic era following the overthrow of veteran leader Omar al-Bashir.

Describing protesters as ""increasingly angry"", the alliance issued its condemnation after some of the worst violence in weeks in central Khartoum.

On Wednesday at least nine people were wounded by troops firing live ammunition to clear demonstrators. On Monday, at least four people were killed when security forces tried to clear some protest sites - the first deaths linked to the Khartoum upheaval in several weeks.

In a televised speech, the head of Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC), Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said the council had decided to suspend talks for 72 hours ""until a suitable atmosphere is created to complete an agreement"".

Burhan said protesters were disrupting life in the capital by blocking roads outside a protest zone agreed upon with the military.

Protesters in recent days have sought to expand their presence beyond a sit-in outside the defense ministry that remains the center of opposition demonstrations.

On Thursday, Reuters witnessed protesters near Khartoum University manning a road block on Nile Street, a major avenue running south of the Blue Nile that is outside of the zone.

The opposition alliance, known as the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF), said that the military council's suspension of talks ignored demonstrators' feelings.

""The suspension of negotiations is regrettable...and ignores the reality of the revolutionaries who are increasingly angry as a result of the bloodshed and the souls that we lost,"" the alliance said in a statement.

It promised to maintain sit-in protests outside the Defense Ministry and across the country.

The sit-in, the culmination of months of demonstrations against Bashir's three-decade rule, was not halted after the army removed him from power on April 11 as the opposition demands that the military hand over power to civilians.

The violence has cast a shadow on talks that had appeared on course to reach a deal on forming a joint military-civilian body to run the country for a three-year transition period until presidential elections.

In Nile Street, some protesters said they thought they should go back to blocking a smaller area, which includes the space outside of the defense ministry compound, where the sit-in started on April 6.

""In my opinion the barriers on Nile Street are unnecessary,"" said 27-year-old Yousef, a doctor, who gave only his first name.

""But some of the guys feel that if we break them down that means we are retreating which means... the old regime, or the ""shadow regiments"" or whatever, will expand into our areas and put pressure on us.""

Another protester, Rayan al-Hadi, 25, said she would follow the instructions of protest leaders if they decided that barriers should be taken down. But she was personally in favor of keeping up the barriers on Nile Street.

""When we closed the street, we had a certain vision for escalation and we don't want to relinquish it,"" Hadi said.

""The people are divided, for and against removing the barriers.""

11402086,2019-05-11,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - A Maltese patrol boat rescued a group of 85 migrants late on Friday night and will bring them to Malta on Saturday morning, the Armed Forces said.

The migrants, believed to be from North and Eastern Africa, were in a sinking wooden boat, the army said.

Malta has spearheaded EU efforts to share migrants rescued in the central Mediterranean among several member states after rescue ships were refused entry by Italy.

The latest case involved the NGO rescue ship Alan Kurdi which picked up 60 migrants and after being refused entry in Italy was allowed to disembark the migrants at Malta on April 13 so that they could be shared between Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg.

The European Union's Commissioner responsible for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, visited Malta on Tuesday and praised the island for its response to irregular migration across the Mediterranean.

""Without a doubt, Malta is facing great migration challenges compared to the size of the population,"" Avramopoulos said.

""Overall, at the EU level we have returned to pre-crisis levels of irregular arrivals, but in Malta arrivals increased in 2018 due to search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean and the volatile and precarious situation in Libya.""

Malta took in 108 migrants in March after its soldiers stormed a small tanker which authorities say had been hijacked by three teenagers, one from Ivory Coast and two from Guinea, who tried to force the boat to take them to Malta and not back to Libya after it had rescued them and other migrants.

11402087,2019-05-10,"RABAT (Reuters) - Moroccan authorities have succeeded in slowing the rate of illegal migration into Spain in recent months after a crackdown on smuggling networks, Morocco's migration and border control chief said on Friday, unveiling new figures to Reuters.

So far 7,202 people have successfully reached Spain from Morocco this year, around 2,000 more than in the same period last year. But more than half of this year's crossings took place in January, with numbers declining sharply over the following three months.

Border control chief Khalid Zerouali told Reuters this showed that government efforts were having an effect.

He said the authorities had prevented 25,000 illegal crossings so far this year, up 30% compared to the same period last year. So far this year there have been no attempts to storm border fences of the Spanish North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.

""The measures taken by Morocco led to stemming the migration flow to Spain,"" Zerouali said.

The route between Morocco and Spain has become one of the main illegal entry routes into Europe for migrants as pressure has been applied to close other routes from Turkey to Greece and Libya to Italy.

Last year some 57,000 people arrived illegally in Spain. Morocco said it stopped 89,000 migrants last year.

The vast majority of illegal Mediterranean crossings are attempted during the summer months which have yet to begin, so the much smaller figures for the first few months of the year are difficult to compare.

Zerouali denied reports that an agreement has been signed with Spain for Morocco to readmit migrants rescued at sea.

Morocco dismantled 50 migrant trafficking networks operating at the local and international levels so far this year, up 63 percent compared with a year earlier, he said. Authorities had also helped combat traffickers by imposing controls on the import and sale of navigation equipment, he added.

The EU has promised 140 million euros in border management aid to help Morocco curb migration flows. Some 30 million euros was disbursed earlier this year.

11402090,2019-03-25,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's call for recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights was manna from heaven for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu two weeks before an election.

For many Arabs, it crushed any hope that there will one day be a negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians and increased doubts that Washington is an impartial arbiter.

But allies and enemies can agree on one thing: Trump's statement last Thursday was a turning point in U.S. policy over territory Israel captured from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed in 1981, in a move the U.N. Security Council declared unlawful.

""I am confident that the Lord is at work here,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Israel when Trump made his announcement on Twitter, told the Christian Broadcasting Network in an interview.

Netanyahu, who has thanked Trump for the announcement, is seeking re-election on April 9 but faces a tough battle and possible indictment in three corruption cases in which he denies wrongdoing.

He was due to meet Trump on Monday on a trip highlighting what Netanyahu calls the strongest ever bond between an Israeli leader and a U.S. president, though Trump has said his decision on the Golan Heights was not connected with the election.

But Trump's decision, following U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017, could tempt other powers to annex land, undermine the roll-out of a U.S. Middle East peace plan and tilt Israel back into conflict with its Arab neighbors, Middle East analysts say.

""Donald Trump has made sure that Israel will be in a perpetual state of war with its Arab neighbors for many decades to come,"" said Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and author of the book Making the Arab World.

""What Trump has done is to hammer a deadly nail in the coffin of the peace process and Arab-Israeli reconciliation. This is a fundamental turning point. There is nothing left to discuss anymore.""

Trump's move is, according to many analysts, partly intended to boost his own chances of re-election in 2020, by targeting the vast pool of U.S. evangelical Christians. Many of them voted for his in 2016 and they are championed in his administration by Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence and others.

The announcement on the Golan Heights was the latest in a flurry of decisions that are widely seen as intended to redraw the contours of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

Most have ticked the wish-list of Israel's right-wing government and met longstanding demands of its U.S. supporters, including U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital. The Arab east of the city was occupied by Israel and then annexed after 1967 in a move that is legally repudiated internationally.

White House officials say the decisions on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights acknowledge the reality on the ground, which they say must be the basis for legitimate peace negotiations.

Trump's Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, said it was inconceivable Israel ""would allow the Golan to be controlled by the state of Syria or by any of the rogue actors operating in the areas, including Iran.""

But with Sunni Arab leaders dealing with crises in Yemen, Syria, Libya, Algeria, Sudan and Qatar, and their standoff with non-Arab Shi'ite Iran, they are less focused on Israel.

Trump's aides have indicated privately that they believe his moves on Jerusalem have provoked a less severe reaction in the Arab world than experts had predicted, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.

In particular, they did not appear to have blocked behind-the-scenes security contacts developed in recent years between Israel and the United States' Gulf allies over their common enemy Iran, the person said.

Aides' advice to Trump on recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights was that Washington could again weather the storm, the same person said.

Support for the move in the Trump administration had gained momentum over the past year as Israel increasingly expressed concern about Iranian forces and their proxies taking up positions in southwestern Syria, the official said.

John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser and one of the administration's leading Iran hawks, was an important proponent of the policy shift, the official said.

But skeptics say the move will also give Iran and its local ally Hezbollah what they would see as justification for new attacks on Israel and hamstring anti-Iranian Arab leaders if they are seen to accept the U.S. move.

The Trump administration has identified Iran as its main target in the Middle East, and withdrew from the deal signed by Tehran, the United States and other world powers in 2015 on curbing Iran's nuclear program.

But after the moves on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, Iran and Hezbollah may feel better able to present themselves as the only steadfast allies of the Palestinian cause.

They could also play into the hands of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by helping him in his portrayals of Israel and the United States as enemies.

""This will give further power to the Iran axis of resistance between Iran-Hezbollah-Assad against Israel and the U.S.,"" said Galip Dalay, visiting fellow at Oxford University and a fellow at Brookings Doha. ""This axis has just been given a very strong symbolic victory and this will give them the high ground.""

He said Arab leaders could not publicly support Trump's decisions on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights because it would threaten their popularity, in some cases already low.

""From the Arab standpoint, this makes them more hesitant to be supportive because the political space they need to maneuver has been eroded,"" said Dennis Ross, a veteran Middle East negotiator. ""Each move by this administration has put Arab states on the defensive.""

Ross also suggested that U.S. recognition of Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights could embolden the Israeli right-wing to step up its push for annexing settlements in the occupied Palestinian West Bank.

""I worry that the right in Israel can say 'they recognized this. It will be a matter of time before we can annex all or part of the West Bank',"" he said. ""That would be the end of the two-state solution.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Jerusalem', 'United States', 'Syria', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Beirut', 'Tehran', 'Yemen', 'Sudan', 'Qatar', 'Libya', 'Algeria', 'Doha']",Trump's Golan move boosts Netanyahu but long-term risks for Israel,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-syria-analysis-idUSKCN1R61NQ,None,
11402091,2019-03-21,"ALGIERS/CAIRO (Reuters) - Protests that brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets in Algeria over the past month led President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to scrap plans to run for a fifth term.

He postponed an election originally set for April and announced that experts would oversee a transition to a ""new system"" in coming months. Protesters say this is not enough.

The immediate cause was Bouteflika's candidacy. Calls for protests spread after it was confirmed on Feb. 10. Mass rallies began on Feb. 22, and numbers rose over the following two Fridays. After Bouteflika abandoned plans to stand but stopped short of stepping down -- raising the prospect that he would stay in power for the rest of the year -- the protests swelled.

More broadly, protests drew on frustration among millions of Algerians who feel politically and economically excluded, and resentment against an aging and secretive elite that has controlled Algeria since independence from France in 1962.

President since 1999, Bouteflika became a symbol of an independence generation that clung to power. He oversaw a return to stability after a civil war in the 1990s but in his second decade in power was incapacitated and mostly absent from public life, fuelling a sense of drift and decline.

Plans to diversify the economy away from oil stalled in a sclerotic system many saw as corrupt and riven with cronyism.

Major Islamist groups were discredited by the 1990s war and along with a liberal opposition were coopted or excluded when it ended. As the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) reasserted itself, political apathy set in and election turnouts dropped.

When uprisings swept the region in 2011, Algeria used a heavy security and oil money to curtail demonstrations.

There were frequent local protests, but these demanded state resources, not political change. Factional battles played out in the domestic media, relatively free by regional standards. Then, as now, neither ruling elite factions nor Bouteflika and his entourage appeared able to agree on a succession plan.

Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, but by then he had already sidelined or outlived the generals who brought him to power. General Mohamed ""Toufik"" Mediene, head of military intelligence and the man widely seen to be the real center of power in Algeria, departed in 2015.

While the army remained Algeria's most powerful institution, an informal clique around the presidency amassed more influence, including Bouteflika's younger brother Said. An emerging business elite profiting from surging oil income also benefited.

Bouteflika announced that an ""independent and inclusive"" national conference would draft and new constitution and set a date for elections, and should conclude its work by the end of the year. An interim, technocratic government is being formed.

But this plan has been cast into doubt as Bouteflika's position has weakened. Protesters want him to step down when his five-year term ends in April and say their goal is sustain pressure and prevent infiltration from ""Bouteflika's system"".

Chief of staff Gaed Salah has said the army should take responsibility for solving the crisis but so far it has been waiting in the wings. The army is more reluctant to intervene directly than in the past. Its decision to cancel parliamentary elections in 1992 that Islamists were poised to win triggered the conflict that left up to 200,000 people dead.

Islamism is in decline, and a new leader may come from the political mainstream. Ahmed Benbitour, a former prime minister, and Mustapha Bouchachi, a rights activist and lawyer, are among those emerging as protest leaders.

Protesters are trying to remain peaceful. From the start, they have worried that factions within the security forces may provoke violence to discredit protesters, or that demonstrations could turn violent when protesters' demands are not met.

Another challenge is to find leaders with enough experience and broad support -- those who served under Bouteflika may be discredited in the eyes of protesters.

Protesters fear that factions holding power and associated patronage networks will look to survive even as they abandon Bouteflika. Most observers believe that while Bouteflika and his clique will leave power, the system around them will remain.

Algeria is Africa's biggest country by landmass and has a population of more than 40 million. It is a major oil and gas producer and OPEC member, and a top supplier of gas to Europe.

Western states see Algeria as a counter-terrorism partner. It is a significant military player in North Africa and the Sahel, and diplomatically involved in crises in Mali and Libya.

By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed

ALGIERS, March 1 (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas in central Algiers on Friday to disperse thousands of Algerians protesting against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's plan to seek a fifth term, witnesses said.

Assembling in the centre of the capital after Friday prayers, protesters opposed to a plan by the 81-year-old leader to extend his 20-year rule in April elections chanted ""Bye, bye Bouteflika"" and ""peaceful, peaceful"". Some carried roses.

The crowd was quickly building up with tens of thousands walking through the city centre within one hour of the start of the protest, residents said.

""Look at the Algerian youth, all it is demanding is a valid president who can talk to the people,"" said Hamdane Salim, a 45-year-old public sector worker.

""Twenty years are enough,"" said Khadidja, a woman accompanied by her husband and children.

Among the crowd was Djamila Bouhired, 83, a heroine of the 1954-1962 independence war against France, who told reporters: ""I'm happy to be here.""

There were also demonstrations in other cities such as Oran, Constantine, Setif, Tizi Ouzou and Bouira drawing in up to thousands, residents said.

Since last Friday thousands have taken part in rarely seen anti-government protests. Bouteflika suffered a stroke in 2013, has been seen in public only a few times since and has given no known speeches in years.

Many Algerians for years avoided politics in public fearing trouble from the omnipresent security services or disillusioned as the country has been run by the same group of veterans since the 1954-1962 independence war with France.

There appeared to be few such inhibitions on Friday.

""People want to overthrow the regime,"" some chanted, using a slogan from the 2011 ""Arab spring"" turmoil which toppled leaders in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.

Bouteflika himself has ruled since 1999 and stamped out a decade-long Islamist insurgency early in his rule. Many Algerians have long tolerated a political system with little space for dissent as a price to pay for peace and stability.

But the new protest waves appears to have broken the long taboo on public discussion of politics.

According to Bouteflika's opponents, there is no evidence he is fit enough to lead the country and that it is being ruled in his name by advisers. Authorities say he retains a firm grip on public affairs despite the rarity of his appearances.

A weak and divided opposition faces high hurdles in mounting an electoral challenge. Since the long-ruling FLN party again picked Bouteflika as its presidential candidate, several parties, trade unions and business groups have endorsed him.

11402093,2019-03-01,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people in cities across Algeria called on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to leave office on Friday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations there since the Arab Spring eight years ago.

The protests were mostly peaceful but as crowds receded by late afternoon, scuffles broke out in the capital Algiers between police and protesters near the presidential palace, witnesses said.

Earlier a sea of people, young and old, had thronged the streets after Friday prayers, chanting ""Bye, bye Bouteflika!"" and ""Peaceful! Peaceful!"". Many were draped in the Algerian flag and carried placards and banners.

Large scale demonstrations - rarely seen in Algeria - against plans for Bouteflika to seek a fifth term in power in April elections began a week ago but Friday saw the biggest turnout yet.

The 81-year-old suffered a stroke in 2013 and has been seen in public only a few times since. His re-election bid stoked resentment among Algerians who believe he is not fit to lead.

""Look at the Algerian youth, all they are demanding is a valid president who can talk to the people,"" said Hamdane Salim, a 45-year-old public sector worker. ""Twenty years are enough,"" said Khadidja, a woman accompanied by her husband and children.

Among the crowd was Djamila Bouhired, 83, a heroine of the 1954-1962 independence war against France, who told reporters: ""I'm happy to be here.""

After hours of marching, many protesters began walking home but some stayed on, dancing and singing.

""This is a celebration, not a protest. We are celebrating Algeria's rebirth,"" said Ali Selmi. ""It's like the end of a football match and Algeria won 3-0.""

Mohammed Saadi, another young man, said: ""Our battle will continue until we win.""

Later Reuters TV footage showed police in riot gear and protesters facing off on a street near the presidential palace swathed in tear gas. Witnesses said clashes resulted in injuries on both sides.

Large crowds also gathered in the cities of Oran, Constantine, Setif, Tizi Ouzou and Bouira, residents and local media said.

Bouteflika, who will turn 82 on Saturday, has not directly addressed the protests. The authorities said last he would travel to Geneva for unspecified medical checks, although there was no official confirmation he had traveled.

Local television stations reported the protests but there was no live coverage. By afternoon state news agency APS had not reported the march. State media had on Tuesday started covering the dissent after journalist employees pressured management.

11402094,2019-02-25,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Until last week the number one topic that Algerian engineer Mohamed Aissiou and his mates would discuss over coffee was soccer. Specifically, local star Riyad Mahrez and his English club Manchester City.

Now it's all about whether President Abdelaziz Bouteflika should go.

Many Algerians have for years avoided politics in public, fearing trouble from the ubiquitous security services, or having simply stopped caring as the country has been run by the same group of men since the 1954-1962 independence war with France.

Bouteflika himself has ruled since 1999 and is credited with ending a decade-long Islamist insurgency early in his rule. Many Algerians have long tolerated a political system with little space for dissent as a price to pay for peace.

But since protests erupted in the capital and some 40 other towns on Friday against ruling party plans for the 81-year old leader to stand for a fifth term, a decades-old taboo on public discussion of politics appears to have evaporated overnight.

""We watch Manchester City matches at the coffee shop then we'll discuss the game,"" Aissiou said, while sipping coffee in the ""Le Circuit"" cafe in downtown Algiers.

""But since the demonstration on Friday, our number one topic is Bouteflika. Mahrez is number two. We want Bouteflika to go, enough, we want change and we want change peacefully.""

Almost 70 percent of Algerians are under 30 years old and most know their leader only from still pictures on the evening television news. He has been seen only a handful of times in public since suffering a stroke in 2013 and has not given a public speech in years.

His opponents believe it has been years since Bouteflika was in any fit state to run the country, and say it is being ruled in his name by advisers. The authorities say he still has a firm grip.

But whatever the state of his health, Bouteflika's remoteness was hammered home by the contrast when French President Emmanuel Macron came for a day visit in 2015. Macron strolled through the capital chatting to passersby, behavior Algerians view as unthinkable for their own president.

Monday saw a pause after three days of street battles between police and demonstrators. Shops reopened in the center of Algiers, with owners lifting the shutters they had hurriedly closed on previous days when police fired tear gas at crowds.

But there were more signs of dissent. Lawyers staged a protest at an Algiers court chanting: ""Enough is enough.""

Reporters at state media who have been barred by their bosses from reporting on the demonstrations have called for a sit-in on Friday. Some private channels, such as Ennahar TV which is close to Bouteflika's circle, have started reporting about the protests, albeit cautiously.

""Bouteflika should leave with honor. He is sick and unable to talk, he must leave,"" said 38-year old Nabil Rahmoun, another cafe-goer who owns a small grocery.

Bouteflika has not addressed the protests directly. As is often the case, even his precise whereabouts are a mystery. The authorities said last week he was due to undergo unspecified medical checks in Switzerland, but there has been no sighting of his departure or arrival.

The ruling elite, made up of members of Bouteflika's FLN party, the military and business tycoons, has dug in its heels, warning of the prospect of unrest.

Algerians have dark memories of the civil war triggered after the army canceled an election that Islamists were poised to win in 1991. Two hundred thousand people are believed to have died in a near-decade of fighting.

Algeria saw major street unrest during the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" that brought down the rulers of North African neighbors Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. But police managed to contain it without Bouteflika's grip on power loosening.

Officials then also calmed dissent by increasing spending. But with prices for Algeria's oil and gas exports having fallen in recent years, such resources have been more limited.

More than a quarter of Algerians under 30 are unemployed, according to official data. The economy is dominated by state-owned firms controlled by the elite, under a system that dates to an era of close ties to the Soviet Union.

Because of Bouteflika's age and health, there has been speculation even among government circles that the president might yield to successor. The name of a former foreign minister recently appointed as a diplomatic adviser, Ramtane Lamamra, has been discussed.

Lamamra is a comparatively spry 66 years old and is on Twitter, the main news source for young people largely ignored by the elite. Bouteflika has no account.

Such an appointment might appease protesters for now while keeping the power system in place, analysts say.

11402095,2019-02-24,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators on a third straight day of rare political protests against plans for rarely seen President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to extend his 20-year rule by seeking a fifth term.

Thousands have taken to the streets of the capital and other cities since Friday calling on the authorities to abandon plans for Bouteflika, 81, to stand in a presidential election scheduled to be held on April 18.

Bouteflika, in office since 1999, suffered a stroke in 2013. He has since been seen in public only a handful of times and has given no public speeches in years.

His opponents say there is no evidence he is in fit health to lead the country, which they say is being ruled in his name by advisers. The authorities say he still has a firm grip on affairs despite the rarity of his appearances.

""People do not want Bouteflika,"" the crowd chanted at a protest called by an opposition group, Mouwatana.

A Reuters journalist saw tear gas being fired to disperse crowds.

Since the ruling FLN party picked Bouteflika as its presidential candidate, several political parties, trade unions and business organizations have already said they would back him. A weak and divided opposition faces high hurdles in mounting an electoral challenge.

Bouteflika has not directly addressed the protests. The authorities announced earlier this week that he would be traveling to Geneva for unspecified medical checks, although there was no official confirmation he had left.

State media quoted a letter in Bouteflika's name read out at a government oil and gas industry event in the southern town of Adrar as saying: ""Continuity is the best option for Algeria.""

FLN leader Moad Bouchareb dismissed the protests.

""To those who are dreaming of change I say 'Have nice dreams,'"" he said in televised comments in the western city of Oran on Saturday.

Supporters of Bouteflika have emphasized the risk of unrest. Algerians have bitter memories of a decade of civil war in the 1990s in which 200,000 people were killed. The war was triggered after the army canceled an election that Islamists were poised to win in 1991.

""Do you want Algeria to go back to years of tears and blood?"" said the leader of the powerful UGTA labor union, Abdelmadjid Sidi Said in televised comments.

Strikes and protests over social and economic grievances are frequent in Algeria, but have generally been localized, rather than touching on national politics.

Algeria saw major street unrest during the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" that brought down the rulers of North African neighbors Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. But Algerian security forces managed to contain it without Bouteflika's grip on power loosening.

Lower oil prices in recent years have hurt Algeria's economy, reigniting discontent.

11402096,2019-02-23,"NEAR BAGHOUZ, Syria (Reuters) - Heading to a camp for displaced people as Islamic State's territorial ""caliphate"" in Iraq and Syria faces final defeat, Ghalia Ali shows no regret about abandoning her life as a student in Tunisia to join the militants in 2014.

The young Tunisian-French woman was among truckloads of civilians leaving the militants' last enclave in eastern Syria.

Like Ali, many were relatives of Islamic State fighters who have followed the group during years of retreat until it fell back to the village of Baghouz, now besieged by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

""God's world is big. The most important thing is that I do not return to France or Tunisia,"" she told Reuters, saying life had been ""impossible"" for her in both places because of her decision to wear the full Islamic face veil, or niqab.

Accompanied only by her two young children at a checkpoint on the edge of Baghouz on Friday, Ali said she did not know what had happened to her Syrian husband from Latakia, an IS fighter who traveled with her to the village near the Iraqi border.

""He is somewhere ... currently I truly don't know where,"" said Ali, laughing faintly beneath her veil.

Ali and her children, a girl aged nearly three and a 18-month-old boy, were headed to the al-Hol camp in SDF-controlled northeast Syria.

The SDF has said it wants all civilians evacuated from Baghouz before it launches a final assault to defeat or force surrender on the remaining fighters. The U.S.-led coalition has described those left inside as the ""most hardened"" IS militants.

The SDF has not ruled out the possibility that some militants have crept out, hidden among the civilians. Warplanes flew overhead on Friday as the evacuation continued, but there was no sound of bombing or clashes.

Ali, who entered Syria from Turkey, lived under IS rule in towns including Jarablus, which was captured by Turkish forces and their Syrian allies in 2016, and in the jihadists' de facto capital at Raqqa, which was seized by the SDF in 2017.

She spoke fondly of the last spell living in adversity in the final IS enclave. ""In Baghouz, especially in the last period, I learnt perhaps all the principles of life,"" she said.

It was the end point in a journey that started in Tunisia after the 2011 revolution that heralded the Arab uprisings, sweeping out the leaders of Libya, Egypt and Yemen, and presaging Syria's own eight-year war.

Under the ousted Tunisian leader Zine al-Abidin Ben Ali, there was a ""very harsh constraint on Muslims"", she said. She herself had not been particularly pious at that point, but something changed when she saw veiled Libyan women who had come to Tunis after their own uprising.

""I saw a woman wearing niqab, I was afraid as it was something strange in Tunis,"" Ali said. Adopting the dress herself, she then faced difficulties continuing her studies at the French institute in Tunis and, for several months, in Toulouse in France, where full face veils are banned.

Along with her mother, who went with her to Syria, Ali joined IS after being won over by one of its propaganda videos. She said she had been disowned by her brother who serves in the French army, which belongs to the coalition backing the SDF.

The gradual defeat of the militant group's ""caliphate"" has rescued millions of people from draconian laws, harsh punishments and, for minorities, slaughter or sexual slavery.

Ali said she would meet at the camp with her mother, who had already quit Baghouz. ""God will fix things for me,"" she said.",Reuters,energy,,"['Tunisia', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Latakia', 'Turkey', 'France', 'Tunis', 'Raqqa', 'Jarabulus', 'Yemen', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Toulouse']",No regrets for woman who stuck by Islamic State through defeats,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-islamic-state-evacuee-idUSKCN1QC0HL,None,
11402097,2019-02-13,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The number of people seeking asylum in the European Union fell for a third straight year in 2018 to less than half the peak during the 2015-2016 migration crisis, data released on Wednesday showed.

The bloc's asylum agency reported 635,000 applications in 2018, still more than double the figures typical before the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" uprisings spread war and instability across North Africa and the Middle East.

The 2018 figure was slightly below 641,000 asylum applications filed in 2014, the last year before a surge in arrivals by the Mediterranean sea created a high-profile humanitarian and political crisis.

The asylum figures peaked at 1.4 million and 1.3 million in 2015 and 2016. One of the main sea routes used by asylum seekers to reach Europe - from Turkey to Greece - was largely shut in 2016, and another - from Libya to Italy - was sharply curbed last year.

Before the ""Arab Spring"", around 300,000 people typically sought asylum in the EU each year.

""We are returning to pre-crisis levels. We are on the right track,"" the EU's top migration official, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said of the report's findings.

Asylum approval rates are falling in the EU, with rejections outnumbering approvals two to one last year, the report by the bloc's asylum agency EASO showed. In 2015, more than half of applications were successful.

The highest number of applicants still came from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq last year, although there was a sharp spike in the number of Colombians and Venezuelans applying.

The arrival of large numbers of asylum seekers to Europe in recent years has created a humanitarian crisis, with thousands dying each year at sea, and a political crisis, leading to a rise in far right parties across the continent.

In Germany, which accepted the largest share of those who arrived in 2015-2016, the new head of Angela Merkel's conservative party, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, announced plans this week for tighter immigration rules, distancing herself from the chancellor.

Anti-immigrant parties are now in power in Italy, Austria and most of the former communist EU countries of the east.

In a separate report on Wednesday, the EU's border agency Frontex said that only 6,760 people crossed into the bloc illegally last month, down by a fifth from the same month last year.

11402100,2019-01-03,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Two militants in Tunisia blew themselves up on Thursday after they exchanged fire with security forces who stormed their hideout and encircled them, the interior ministry said.

The existence of the cell in the city of Jilma, 250 km (156 miles) south of the capital, shows the challenge Tunisia faces from militants, some of whom cross the porous borders from Libya and Algeria.

Authorities identified Ezzedine Alaoui, leader of the Brigade of Jihad and Unity, as among the dead, said Soufien Sliti, a spokesman for the counter-terrorism agency.

He was the mastermind of a terrorist plot to take control of Sidi Bouzid province south of Tunis, Sliti said.

Aloui joined Jund Al Khilafa, another militant group in the mountains between Sidi Bouzid and Kasserine, in 2014 but left to join the Brigade of Jihad and Unity, that came to be known as the cell of Sidi Bouzid, Sliti said.

Most members of the cell were arrested on Dec. 5 in Sidi Bouzid in an operation during which material for making bombs was seized.

Since an uprising against autocratic leader Zine Abidine Ben Ali in 2011, Tunisia has been battling militant groups operating in remote areas near the border with Algeria.

Authorities estimate about 3,000 Tunisians have joined Islamic State and other jihadist groups in Iraq, Syria and Libya, while high unemployment has stoked unrest in recent years in southern and central areas.

Dozens died in attacks in 2015 including two against tourists, one at a museum in Tunis and another on a beach in Sousse. A third attack targeted presidential guards in the capital and killed 12. Islamic State claimed the attacks.

11402149,2019-04-30,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - With the frontlines around Libya's contested capital Tripoli stalemated, the two rival factions are bringing oil and money supplies into the firing line of their battle for power.

Khalifa Haftar, chief of the eastern-based forces which are attacking the city, is putting pressure on state oil firm NOC and its operations in his fiefdom, diplomats and analysts say.

In response, the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli is limiting his access to hard currency, the sources said.

The moves mark a new turn in a war which started in early April when Haftar, who is allied to a parallel administration in eastern Libya, mounted a campaign to capture Tripoli.

His Libyan National Army (LNA) fighters have been unable to advance into the city center and costs are piling up as ammunition and other supplies need to be brought in from their home base in Benghazi 1,000 km (600 miles) away.

This has prompted Haftar to use oil as a strategic asset.

The LNA controls areas surrounding most of Libya's oil infrastructure but it does not benefit directly from oil and gas sales, which go through NOC in Tripoli managing the day-to-day operations.

NOC has tried to stay out of the conflict but it distributes energy revenues to the Tripoli-based central bank, which only works with Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.

In recent days, Haftar has met with two executives working for NOC in the east in his base outside Benghazi.

The first was the chairman of NOC subsidiary AGOCO, which produces a third of Libya's output. Then Haftar met NOC board member Jadallah al-Awakli.

His office released pictures of the meetings showing the general dressed in military uniform.

Asked by Reuters about his meeting, Awakli said oil operations were benefiting from security provided by the LNA.

""I congratulate the LNA on its victories,"" he said.

Another NOC unit in east Libya, Sirte Oil firm, also expressed support for the Tripoli offensive on its website.

The meetings took place days after the LNA sent a warship to Ras Lanuf port -- 600 km (400 miles) from the frontlines.

At the same time NOC said soldiers had entered Es Sider port and seized its air strip. It condemned what it called a ""militarization"" of oil facilities but did not name the LNA, which controls the area.

LNA officials denied this and said oil ports work normally.

Diplomats and analysts saw the move as a sign that Haftar wants to remind Tripoli he can stop oil exports as a way to pressure Serraj into a deal to share oil revenues should he not win on the battlefield.

The LNA last year tried to export oil bypassing NOC via a parallel NOC entity which has some 500 staff on duty.

""NOC is concerned by renewed attempts to divide the corporation,"" a spokesman for NOC Tripoli said. ""It is particularly alarmed by evidence of staff coercion and is attempting to clarify the circumstances behind recent statements in support of the armed assault on Tripoli.""

Analysts said Haftar is under financial pressure because Tripoli has limited his access to hard currency.

The LNA needs to import gear via merchants as its main foreign backers, Egypt and United Arab Emirates, have provided heavy equipment such as helicopters but have been reluctant to provide cash, Western and Gulf diplomatic sources said.

""Haftar appears to be contingency planning for how he will continue funding his growing operation and what will likely be a prolonged conflict,"" said Tarek Megerisi, a European Council

policy fellow.

Diplomats said Haftar is trying gain the upper hand in the Tripoli war before the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan next week, when life slows down. The LNA would still need to maintain costly supply lines if a long stalemate occurs.

Haftar could try to force Tripoli into a deal by blocking oil exports, which would end funding for the government, or he could even consider trying to sell oil again, analysts said.

Washington stopped previous such attempts, even dispatching Navy SEALs to storm a tanker which had set off from a port run by a rogue commander in 2014.

""Given he currently enjoys the backing of President (Donald) Trump, Haftar may now feel emboldened to try again and create a reliable revenue stream for himself,"" Megerisi said.

Trump told Haftar in a phone call he ""recognized"" his efforts in securing oil facilities, the White House has said.

Libya's output has been so far unaffected, remaining at about 1.1 million barrels a day though the conflict has divided even technocrats. An oil manager in Tripoli joined the front as well as engineers in the east.

An armed group on Monday attacked the southern El Sharara oilfield, which pumps 300,000 bpd, exploiting a vacuum as the LNA has moved troops north.

Tripoli has responded to Haftar's moves with the central bank (CBL) on Monday imposing special checks on four banks, three of them in Benghazi, before they can get hard currency.

It cited ""suspicions of corruption"" but the east said this was just an excuse.

""CBL...has opened a frontline of war and a siege on banks in Barqa,"" said Ramzi al-Agha, head of the liquidity committee at the eastern parallel central bank.

""Barqa"" is a term for the east often used by activists demanding secession or at least autonomy from the west.

Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, said Haftar felt emboldened by a paralysis of U.N Security Council which has been unable to even call for a ceasefire.

""Using the counter-terrorism argument many profound changes could be implemented especially with foreign support,"" he said. ""A big chunk of at oil exports is at risk owing to political reasons.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Benghazi', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Sirte', 'Washington (state)', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates']",Libya's rival governments move to financial war with frontline stuck,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-oil-analysis-idUSKCN1S61HR,None,
11402191,2019-11-29,"The past two days have seen forces loyal to Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) seize and then lose a key oilfield in the south, suggesting that General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) is still the king of the country's oil.

On Wednesday, the GNA announced it had taken control of the El Feel oilfield, which produces about 70,000 bpd, pushing Haftar's forces out.

Later that same day, Haftar's LNA launched airstrikes at the gates of the facilities, retaking the oilfield without causing any damage.

On Thursday, forces loyal to Haftar said that Chadian forces working for the GNA were preparing to attack the nearby Sharara oilfield, the country's largest, Reuters reported. LNA warplanes claim to have repelled the attack, though this could not be confirmed independently.

Production at El Feel had been suspended on Wednesday, but was gradually restarting by Thursday, as confirmed by the Libyan National Oil Company (NOC).

No NOC staff were harmed in the fighting, and facilities suffered only minor damage.

In a statement on Thursday, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said: ""I remind all parties that Libya's oil and gas fields are vital sources of revenues for the benefit of all Libyans. They must not be treated as military targets. Any fighting in the vicinity of any of our facilities forces us to cease production, in order to ensure the safety of our employees. When production ceases, all Libyans lose out.""

Last week, the Trump administration seemed to be moving towards support for General Haftar following a series of meetings with Eastern Libyan representatives and suggestions that one of Haftar's representatives, Aref al-Nayed, would be expected to play a key role in the new Libyan leadership once Tripoli was ""liberated"" by the LNA.

U.S. support for Haftar has gone back and forth this year.

11402192,2019-09-11,"There's a good reason oil prices tanked on Tuesday (temporarily) and then continued to do so on Wednesday. Bolton has always been a warmonger, while Trump is a leveraged negotiator who may bring things to the brink of war but is not gunning for a conflict; rather for leverage in a high-stakes game. With Bolton out, speculators flirted with the assumption that this means a potential deal in the works with Iran or at least some sort of detente.

Israeli media is all over this, referring to Bolton as ""marginalized"" and suggesting this signals and end to US sanctions on Iran - an outcome that does not suit Netanyahu who, on the tailwinds created by Bolton, has become emboldened to do things like annex part of the occupied West Bank and destroy any chance of a peace deal with the Palestinians.

Trump's announcement that Bolton is out comes after the National Security Advisory on Sunday said sanctions on European firms over Iran were ""possible"". It also brings into clearer view Trump's statement to the effect that he would be open to meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Iran has played coy on this, saying the president would not meet with Trump until sanctions were lifted, but with regime-change Bolton out of the picture, Trump might just get his way. Bolton did what he was meant to do - raise tensions for leverage, but he has no further use.

Syrian Oil & Gas: Russia's Gain, America's Loss

Russia needs to strengthen its position in the Eastern Mediterranean - and it will use Syria to do it.

Syria's oil and gas supplies, and pipeline access, were at the heart of a conflict that most think was simply about political differences with the Assad regime.

The primary interest here is in Syria's offshore potential because it shares the Levant basin with Israel (and Lebanon), and this is where Israel struck two major gas discoveries that have put it on the energy power map: The Tamar and Leviathan gas fields. Those Israeli finds change the geopolitical game quite dramatically.

Now, Israel has much more negotiating leverage. It's signed a $2B gas export contract with Egypt as of Q1 this year, which brings Egypt into the Israeli fold on global issues. It's also planning a pipeline with Greece and Cyprus to move gas to Greece and onward to Europe. Right now, that pipeline project hasn't proven itself to be economically feasible, but we're keeping a close eye on it.

Where does that leave Russia? In great need of a better position in the Mediterranean, and its key inroad here is Syria.

The US has stepped up its military presence in the region using Cyprus, which Moscow views as highly confrontational.

Russia's biggest move is to ensure that no one else is capable of supplying all the EU's gas needs because Moscow cannot afford to lose its grip on this market share. This is what is behind Russia's vehement support for Syria's Assad regime - Syria is the key to maintaining its control of the Mediterranean and getting out in front of any new gas projects that threaten its EU market share. Eventually, Europe's gas is going to come from the Mediterranean: The question now is who will control that gas.

That brings us squarely back to control of Syria, which most importantly includes the US, Russia, Iran and Turkey. The US nominally controls the Syrian Kurdish forces who in turn control the key onshore oilfields in the country's northeast. This area accounts for nearly all of Syria's onshore production and production potential. The US does not control this oil, though. The Syrian Kurds are pragmatic: They'll sell it to anyone, including Assad, regardless of what the US wants.

But in January this year, Russia won all the rights (exclusively) to produce oil and gas in Syria in return for taking on the tens of billions of dollars in costs to get the industry up and running again. In order to make good on this deal, Russia is going to have to 'handle' the Syrian Kurds. And the US will leave Syria sanctions in place to make sure that the Russians can't get too far with their rehabilitation efforts.

That technically leaves the Russians with offshore potential only. But offshore could be massively bigger than onshore, though it is likely to be a gas bonanza more than anything. Still, that's precisely the kingmaker for Europe.

That is the background for a series of deals Russia signed with the Syrian Oil Ministry a week ago. Those deals concern exploration, drilling and production in Syria's central and eastern region -- not on Syrian Kurdish territory.

In the meantime, Russia is helping Iran skirt sanctions by transporting crude through ports in Crimea, bypassing the Suez Canal.

Global Oil & Gas Playbook

- Algerian Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui is planning to step down to allow for elections later this year, which the military hopes will end months of high-level protests. Bedoui's stepping down is a key demand of protesters. Oil will play heavily into this equation because crude has been propping up this state, led for long by a military-faction and a presidential faction, the latter which has recently lost power. Algeria's oil and gas resources are depleting, and this chips away at the military clan's ability to maintain order, with mass protest movements now calling many of the shots. Oil industry expansion isn't moving forward, and budgeting assumes a price of oil that is not exactly today's.

- Libya's Government of National Accord's (GNA) latest move against General Haftar is to try to squeeze his kerosene supplies in areas he controls. Where this gets tricky is with the National Oil Company, which is charged with restricting these supplies. The NOC must remain a neutral force in the conflict amid General Haftar's offensive to take Tripoli. The NOC is in a very difficult position here, cooperating with the GNA in Tripoli, but also required to cooperate with Haftar because he's the LNA strongman who controls the oilfields.

- Chevron appears to be making preliminary preparations for a potential exit from Venezuela as the country sinks further into chaos and as the US administration seeks to more vigorously levy sanctions on the socialist regime and anyone doing business with it. Chevron has updated some of its contracts with partners in Venezuela in such a way that would allow it to leave the country without penalty for early termination. The company's waiver to operate in sanctioned Venezuela expires on October 25. Chevron has officially denied that it is planning on leaving the country but has reiterated that it will comply with the law in this regard.

- JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) shares are up as media label it as the frontrunner for investment banks to take the lead in Aramco's upcoming IPO, which appears to be moving along at a healthy pace now with the reshuffling of Saudi Arabia's energy ministry and Aramco's board. From Friday at $112.63, JPM's stock rose to $116.23 by mid-day on Tuesday. Aramco is now said to be finalizing the entire list of banks that will manage the deal. Morgan Stanley, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs are all thought to be still in the running. More updates are expected in the coming days regarding which banks will have what roles in what is expected to be the world's largest IPO.

- Guyana is booming, and the finds just keep coming. The latest find is expected to be announced as early as by Friday this week, but the details, for now, have not been revealed. Guyana is the number-one oil hotspot, with Exxon leading the charge. Its relatively fledgling oil industry has seen the country's GDP double in less than a year and a half. The only thing left for Guyana to do now is to ensure its oil and gas policies are sufficient to manage the wealth of oil that will soon be coming out of the ground--as well as managing the foreign oil firms that have been rushing in.

- Equinor is currently assessing the hurricane-related damage to its Grand Bahama South Riding Point oil storage terminal, which has resulted in an oil leak of unspecified quantity. Equinor's storage tanks there--some of which have no tops thanks to the storm--have the capacity to hold 6.75 million barrels of oil, although it only had 1.8 million barrels at the time of the hurricane. Equinor has said that the spill is not ongoing and that it will clean up the spill this week.

- Russia's federal agency for subsoil use, Rosnedra, has determined that the Pobeda offshore oil field in the costly Arctic is only practical with oil prices at or above $130 to $140 per barrel. Rosneft scrapped its Arctic project in the Kara Sea after Exxon pulled out of the project in order to not run afoul with the US sanctions. That agreement was inked in 2011 when oil prices were above $100 per barrel, and was found to hold 125 million tons of oil. With oil prices trading at not even half that amount, this Arctic prospect is likely to remain undeveloped for a considerable amount of time.

- China's CNPC is skipping oil loadings from Venezuela for a second month in a row, nervous due to the increased sanctions on Venezuela. China's oil imports from Venezuela are still ongoing thanks to other intermediaries such as Rosneft--who apparently isn't so concerned about the sanctions, but those loadings have fallen sharply to their lowest level in five years in July. China has been the largest importer of crude since the sanctions took effect.

- Putin greenlighted a new gas pipeline project that will deliver gas to China and has ordered construction to begin. The Power of Siberia pipeline--a separate project--will also start pumping later this year. Now, Gazprom will be working to deliver gas by way of Mongolia to Chinese buyers. The project, formerly known as the Altai pipeline, is now referred to as the western supply route. An agreement has already been reached with Mongolia. China's appetite for gas has increased as it pushes to switch more consumers over from coal.

- Moldovan authorities announced that as of January next year, Moldovan-Russian joint-stock company Moldovagaz will get a discount of $10-15 for Russian gas. Moldovagaz's existing gas supply and transit deal with Gazprom expires at the year's end. Last year, Gazprom supplied 2.94 Bcm of Russian gas to Moldova.

- Spanish Repsol SA is in advanced talks to purchase $1 billion in Exxon's deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico. The sale, if successful, would go a long way toward helping Exxon meet its $15 billion divestment goal as it focuses on US shale and Guyana assets, not to mention seeks cash to repurchase additional shares that had to be sold when times were tough. Repsol already has a presence in the Marcellus shale.

- GE is planning to sell millions of shares in Baker Hughes oil services company, relinquishing its majority stake. GE and affiliates will sell $250 million in stock back to Baker Hughes, and will also divest 105 million shares in an underwritten secondary offering. GE will go from 5 board members on Baker Hughes, to one. GE stock has lost 24% in the past year.

- Saudi Arabia has announced its plans to enrich uranium for use in generating nuclear power for the country--a country that is trying to back off domestic oil consumption in order to free more oil for exports, and longer-term, to diversify away from such a reliance on oil. Its nuclear plans, which it insists would be strictly for power generation and not for nuclear weapons manufacturing, will likely unnerve its regional rival Iran, who also has insisted it is well on its way toward developing nuclear technologies. Saudi Arabia has so far refused to sign a treaty that says it will not use the uranium for weapons, causing further concern.

- Billionaire investor John Paulson's hedge fund has opposed Callon Petroleum Co's proposed $3.2 billion acquisition of Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. The fund said Callon's stock has lost 36% since the acquisition deal was announced and urged Callon to pursue selling itself.

- Qatar has shortlisted international oil firms for a stake in its expanded North Field LNG megaproject. The results of the invitation process are due to be announced early next year. It is, however, possible that Qatar Petroleum will, in the end, choose to go it alone unless some of the foreign majors offer up something of significant value. Those majors include French Total, Exxon, Shell, and Italian Eni.

- Australia's Woodside is seeking to reduce its stakes in the Scarborough gas field at home and in Canada's Kitimat LNG project. The company holds a 75% stake in the Scarborough gas field and a 50% stake in the Kitimat project. It is speculated that Saudi Aramco could be interested in Scarborough.

11402193,2019-07-19,"* US shale player Carrizo Oil & Gas is selling over to Callon Petroleum for a total of $3.2 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in stock and the rest in debt. This is a merger deal for Texas shale, specifically for the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford. The deal is expected to close in Q4. The merger will produce a company with around 200,000 net acres in both basins, with average production of around 100,000 boepd in Q1 2019.

* BlackRock has announced it will acquire a majority stake in a solar and storage solutions business, Distributed Solar Development, owned by the renewables arm of General Electric. GE Renewable Energy will retain a 20% interest in the new venture.

* If you're looking for deals in the wind energy sector, look for those companies who haven't been able to keep pace with market disruption. One of those is India-based wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy, which has failed to make principal payments on its bond issuance of $546.91 million. Rumor is now that it's targeted for acquisition and that Canadian Brookfield Asset Management is planning a majority stake offer.

Discovery & Development

* We've just seen the first LNG freight derivatives trade using Baltic Exchange spot price assessments. This was brokered by Affinity Shipping between Total Gas & Power and trading giant Glencore. Why is this important? Because we've seen charter rates for tight vessels increase by four times and that has affected LNG spot trading. Essentially, those rates determine how LNG is transported. There is a significant amount of volatility with respect to freight rates. So this is the first we're seeing that a brokerage is hedging forward price risks with freight derivatives.

* Output in Norway's offshore Gudrun field will be extended with a $280-million water injection investment, courtesy of Equinor. Gudrun produces from seven wells, but production has been declining. The water injection will extend the life of the field for three additional years, to 2032. Equinor is the operator with a 36% stake; Neptune has 25%; OMV has 24%; and Repsol has 15%.

* A fire at the oldest refinery on the US East Coast will shut down its remaining units on Monday, following a fire on June 21st. Pennsylvania has no plans to bail out the aging refinery, saying that it cannot compete with newer, more efficient refineries. Crude supplies have been used up, and remaining crude shipments will be diverted elsewhere. The refinery is owned by Philadelphia Energy Solutions and handles 335,000 bpd. Some 1,000 workers are expected to be laid off.

* The conflict between Libya's GNA and General Haftar has brought any prospect of Libya increasing oil output to a standstill--until one or the other sides fully control it. But the Tripoli-based NOC has a new trick up its sleeve: It's going boost what's available for export by converting a large power station to natural gas, freeing up 15,000 bpd for export.

* There's been a lot moving Tesla stock this week. The EV giant's move to cut Model 3 prices led to downward pressure earlier in the week because it signalled fear of slacking demand. But Tesla ended the week on a high note from Morgan Stanley, which all but decreed that Tesla would end up being the biggest EV supplier in China, and that production of the model three at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory 3 would start as soon as November this year. It was a decidedly bullish verdict for Tesla.

Tenders, Auctions & Contracts

* McDermott International has sealed two big contracts with Saudi Aramco's offshore Marjan project worth $4.5 billion. One deal worth $3 billion will see McDermott handle engineering, procurement, construction and installation of the Marjan offshore gas-oil separation plant. The second contract worth $1.5 billion will see McDermott provide the same for offshore gas facilities and pipelines. Engineering will launch in Q3 and completion is set for the end of 2022.

* Shell and Exxon are eyeing a return to Somalia ahead of an oil block auction scheduled for later this year, according to Somali official sources. This would mark the first interest by any supermajors since Somali descended into chaos in the 1990s. Shell and Exxon operated five offshore blocks here until the fall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Shell has noted that it has accrued ""rentals"" to the government since then. Earlier this year, Somalia passed a new petroleum bill, and that has set the ball rolling again, with talks ostensibly taking place to revisit these old contracts. Somalia's oil sector has been paralyzed by anarchy and terrorism for decades. And getting back in this game won't be a cake walk. In many ways, though, Somalia is the last offshore frontier for oil. Only two exploration wells have been drilled offshore, and even those have been in the ""nearshore"" areas and not even 100 meters deep. There's a ton of exploration and de-risking to do here.

* Colombian authorities are gearing up for a second oil and gas bid round that includes 50 blocks. At the first round in June, Colombia accepted bids from six companies for 10 oil contracts. The country expects to receive some $1.5 billion in oil investment over the coming months.

* The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is gearing up to offer 77.8 million acres in a region-wide lease sale that kicks off on August 21st. This auction (Lease Sale 253) includes all available unleased areas in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The auction will be live-streamed from New Orleans. There will be a total of 10 region-wide lease sales by BOEM in total, with two each year. The August 21st sale will include over 14,500 unleased blocks located between 3 and 231 miles offshore. Water depths range from 3 to 3,400 meters.

* Saudi Arabia is looking at licensing new stock market operators in what may be step 1 of transforming Tadawul into a private exchange, which has so far progressed at a glacial pace. When--or if--successful, Saudi is hoping the move may attract more foreign investment and shrink the country's dependence on crude. Despite the Tadawul reforms, its ultimate diversification hopes lie in the Aramco IPO.

* India's ministry of petroleum and natural gas has revealed awards for 32 blocks in the latest two exploration licensing rounds, with most of the takers domestic companies. State-owned Oil India Ltd picked twelve blocks followed by private resources major Vedanta Ltd with 10. A consortium of Reliance Industries Ltd and BP Plc were awarded one block. The authorities are hoping to attract more than $1 billion of investments in exploration and production blocks awarded under new rules.

* It's not Ghana, but it's garnering even less interest from the world's supermajors: Israel's offshore Mediterranean bidding saw only two groups throw their hat in the ring for exploration. One group includes British Cairn Energy, SOCO International and Israeli Ratio Oil. The second group is Energean and Israel Opportunity. There are 19 blocks available, and these two groups bid on 16 of those.

* BP and Reliance will spend $5 billion on three gas development projects in India's Bay of Bengal, in the Krishna-Godavari basin, by 2022. The projects are aimed to help reverse the falling gas output from what was once the biggest gas-producing block in the country.

* The Russian government has allocated nearly 50 billion Russian rubles ($800 million) to construct liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers for the Arctic LNG 2 project, expected to start in 2023. Russia, as a leading global producer and exporter of conventional natural gas, intends to grow its LNG potential amid the escalating pressure coming from Washington reflected in sanctions. Earlier this month, a consortium of Japanese companies has signed an agreement for a 10 percent interest in the Arctic LNG 2 project. The project envisages constructing three LNG trains at 6.6 million tons per annum each.

* Oman has launched a tender process for two independent power projects with a combined output of 1.1GW. Each will have a capacity of between 500MW and 600MW and are expected to be commissioned in 2022 and 2023, as Oman aims to add 5GW of solar capacity by the end of 2024.

* Canadian Solar has won a 51.1-MWp solar project in Brazil as the result of a tender process launched in late June. The company will build and install some 130,000 of its modules in the state of Minas Gerais to generate some 107,748 MWh of electricity per year. But keep your eye on this company: This is the Canadian-based, Chinese-owned company whose CEO was just replaced under mysterious circumstances that have kept hedge funds guessing as to what's really going on. CEO Shawn Qu was replaced recently, with the company saying only that he was recovering in the hospital after an apparent car accident in Beijing. The lack of details makes investors very nervous.

Regulations & Compliance

* Italian Eni is trying to extricate itself from possible involvement in a shipment of Iraqi crude oil that may have contained Iranian crude. This week, Eni filed a fraud complaint against its former head of oil trading over the shipment. The former head of trading, Alessandro Des Dorides, is accused by Eni of misleading parties to the deal and holding the role in the deal of another, small trading firm, Napag. The incident goes back to May, when this crude shipment arrived at an Eni-owned refinery in Sicily. Eni rejected the shipment because the oil was not Iraqi Basra Light crude, as expected.

* The California Department of Conservation has ordered Chevron to take immediate action to stop the flow of an oil and water mixture of 19,000 barrels from its Kern County Cymric oilfield. The oil portion of the spilled mixture equates to about 5,700 barrels of oil, 90% of which has already been cleaned up. California has been trying to quash oil and gas, and that means Kern County--so, this incident is likely to provide more ammunition for industry opposition.

* Brazil's Petrobras, after making a deal with a Brazilian antitrust regulator, has agreed to offload 27 stakes in natgas transportation and distribution companies, opening up competition in Brazil's gas industry that has so far been stifled by Petrobras' effective monopoly. This increased competition will come from interested parties looking to get their hands in Brazil's energy sector, and could include Engie, Repsol, GALP, and others. Concerns remain about the current regulatory challenges that opening up the market would create, which Brazil has so far not had much need for.

* Pakistani authorities arrested former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in a multimillion dollar case related to the award of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import contract. Authorities are investigating Abbasi's role in the awarding of a contract to a liquefied natural gas company in Qatar in which Abbasi was a shareholder. He denies any wrongdoing and says the probe is driven by political victimization. Country's anti-graft body was probing alleged corruption in the contract to import LNG from Qatar when Abbasi was a Minister in former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Cabinet. Sharif is in prison himself. Last year, he was handed a seven-year sentence for failing to account for his overseas assets.

* Russian authorities have arrested Dmitry Mazurov, former owner of the Antipinsky refinery, Russia's largest independent oil refinery, in a case that is potentially about embezzlement. While prosecutors have not released specific charges, Russian media say Mazurov is accused of embezzling $600 million that had been allocated for refinery construction. In May, the refinery filed for bankruptcy--some $5.5 billion in debt--and a Sberbank JV acquired an 80% stake in the refinery.

* There is a dangerous nuclear debacle unfolding in the US state of Ohio. This week, the state managed to pass a budget to save two nuclear reactors after the owner threatened to close them down without financial support. The owner is FirstEnergy Solutions, and the utility is bankrupt. On Tuesday, the Ohio Senate approved a bill to subsidize nuclear, solar and coal power, while lowering monthly surcharges that would support clean-energy and renewable energy mandates. That would bail out FirstEnergy's nuclear reactors. But on Wednesday, a vote on the bill in the House was delayed. If it passes the House, this corporate bailout program would end up charging utility customers hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize the nuclear power plants. They're likely to pass because of the threat by the owner to close them down without financial support.

Politics, Geopolitics & Conflict

* Unknown attackers have taken out a gas pipeline in Syria linking the al-Shaer gas field with Ebla Gas Factory in the eastern Homs area. The pipeline transports 2.5 million cubic meters of gas daily to Ebla Factory and onward to power plants.

* The US is sending additional troops to Saudi Arabia as tensions heat up between the US and Iran. However, this also comes as Trump taps Senator Rand Paul as US liaison for Iran, which suggests a softening in stance and a sign that Washington finally understands that this game has been misplayed. Oil prices fell 1% on the idea that the ongoing tensions with Iran may soon be over. That does not mean that tensions have ceased to simmer, especially with the Iranian seizure of a foreign oil tanker and its crew of 12 in the Persian Gulf. Iran initially said that it led the vessel into Iranian waters in order to assist it in distress; however, Iranian statements later said the vessel had been smuggling some 264,000 gallons of fuel to foreign customers. In other words, Iran claims that Iranian smugglers were using the vessel. How this is interpreted going forward will play further into the game of creating fear in global shipping lanes. This then led to the unclear drone incident, which intends to keep tensions high for a singular aim: To get back to the nuclear negotiating table. Both sides are after this, rather than conflict. Iran has offered come concessions to get back to the negotiating table as of late Thursday.

* A senior Turkish diplomat and an Iraqi civilian have been killed in Erbil, in the territory of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq. This was an assassination, and the motive remains unclear. .This is an unusual form of attack in Erbil, which by Iraqi standards is a relatively peaceful city. There were three gunmen who opened fire on the targets in a restaurant in the Kurdish capital. (We will continue to follow this with sources on the ground).

* Prepare for yet another phase in the Libya conflict, as rumors mount that the UAE is setting up a military base in neighboring Niger to more readily aid Haftar in his push to take over Tripoli. This conflict went external noticeably earlier this month with Turkey's direct involvement in helping the GNA retake a key base from Haftar, south of Tripoli, and then Haftar responded by shooting down a Turkish drone and detaining a handful of Turkish sailors, while promising to target Turkish assets in the country. The natural response is for someone on the other side of this game to reach out in kind--to Haftar--to rebalance.

* Afghan military forces say they have freed two oil tanker trucks hijacked by the Taliban in an operation in the Chashma-e Sher area of Baghlan province. Five Taliban fighters were killed in the operation. There have been a number of similar incidents over the past few months in this province, with the Taliban intercepting tankers and demanding payments for safe transit. Oil tankers enter Afghanistan via the Hairatan port in Balkh and transport fuel onwards by truck to other provinces.

* An American-Israeli business has been accused of facilitating the sale of oil from the Kurdish-controlled area of Syria to the Israelis. But while denying the facilitation of those sales, he also noted that he was trying to keep this oil from getting into Iranian hands, while also decrying that he's not on any side in this conflict. Each of these three things contradict the other. The middleman here, Moti Kahana, says he's an American who does not serve Israel. The Syrian Kurds have also denied selling oil to the Israelis. If the Syrian Kurds can't sell their oil to Iran, there aren't many options because their only outlet is through Turkey, which is closed off to Kurds of any brand at this point. So, the only pathway is through the Iraqi Kurds and then on to Iran. In question are 11 oil wells that the Syrian Kurds control, which also represents the lion's share of Syria's oil production. This is how a middleman launches another phase of warfare--by selling that oil to the Israelis, which rather changes Israel's role in this game.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Somalia', 'Brazil', 'Texas', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'Israel', 'Colombia', 'Canada', 'Pennsylvania', 'Washington (state)', 'Kern County, California', 'California', 'Philadelphia', 'New Orleans', 'Shanghai']",Clean Energy Acquisitions Pick Up | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Clean-Energy-Acquisitions-Pick-Up.html,None,
11402194,2019-07-17,"That Missing Oil Tanker, And Iran's Game of Leverage

We said the cat-and-mouse game over security in global oil shipping lanes would get worse; and it has. On Sunday, a UAE-based oil tanker (a Panamanian ship, MT Riah) was traveling through the Strait of Hormuz when it suddenly stopped transmitting. It was last seen in the Persian Gulf, off Iran's Queshm Island. It hasn't been heard from since. It disappeared from radar near a base of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

But what happens next depends entirely on interpretation. According to our sources, this is a tiny vessel. Tankers trackers will confirm that. That's why it took from Sunday until Tuesday for this story to really become interesting to the media. The US wants it to be interesting. So does Iran. It's bait for leverage to see how we'll end this conflict by bringing Iran back to the nuclear table.

But the reality is that it's a small tanker, that is only nominally UAE-based, with no UAE crew. And it's really no mystery. The Iranian foreign minister has already said that they pulled the tanker into Iranian waters to provide it with assistance when it was having trouble--ostensibly. If they 'hijacked' it, it was just to ratchet up tensions and hope that it was big enough for anyone to care. In this atmosphere of fear around the Strait of Hormuz and all the pathways to it, anything works to that end.

The likelihood is that this cat-and-mouse game will sooner or later end up with the US and Iran back at the negotiating table after an awful lot of wasted time and misguided strategy that doesn't work.

But short of conflict, it may prompt other major changes in oil trading. The UAE is now said to be considering a major overhaul of state-run ADNOC's trading operations, and the creation of its own regional benchmark as soon as this year. Why? It's about influence, and the UAE has export alternatives to the Strait of Hormuz, and can store oil elsewhere--that means a Murban benchmark would have the potential to lure in foreign buyers. And at a time when fear is at an all-time high in the Strait, this is a solid pitch. Even beyond this, the UAE idea takes things further than the preparations for an Aramco IPO in terms of restructuring. They want it to trade freely on the market, according to Reuters. Over the next couple of weeks, we'll be using our sources on the ground in the region to flesh out the potential for this to happen.

Libya's 15,000bpd Trick to Boost Exports

The conflict between Libya's GNA and General Haftar has brought any prospect of Libya increasing oil output to a standstill--until one or the other sides fully control it. But the Tripoli-based NOC has a new trick up its sleeve: It's going boost what's available for export by converting a large power station to natural gas, freeing up 15,000 bpd for export.

In the meantime, prepare for yet another phase in this conflict, as rumors mount that the UAE is setting up a military base in neighboring Niger to more readily aid Haftar in his push to take over Tripoli. This conflict went external noticeably earlier this month with Turkey's direct involvement in helping the GNA retake a key base from Haftar, south of Tripoli, and then Haftar responded by shooting down a Turkish drone and detaining a handful of Turkish sailors, while promising to target Turkish assets in the country.

The natural response is for someone on the other side of this game to reach out in kind--to Haftar--to rebalance. Thus, we enter the next phase.

Why almost no-one wants Ghana's offshore riches

Why is it that only Italy's Eni--among the supergiants--is interested in offshore Ghana's oil riches? Exxon is out of the game, and BP, too. In the Jubilee field alone, we're talking about a potential 3 billion barrels.

Part of the reason is the oil price crash, which made operating in Sub-Saharan Africa's corrupt and unstable environment hardly worth it. In May, Exxon and BP abruptly withdrew from the bidding process for six oil blocks. They said they just weren't interested anymore.

That leaves Ghana with the bottom of the barrel to pick from, outside of Eni, which has the stomach for Sub-Saharan Africa more than anyone else does. French Total SA will creep in the backdoor here by acquiring Anakarko's assets in the area.

That means that aside from Eni, Ghana is left with Nigeria's First E&P, which isn't exactly a boost of confidence for attracting additional foreign investors--even when it's the lucrative Jubilee and TEN mega oilfields up for grabs.

Back in 2010, Exxon was interested. It tried to buy Kosmos Energy's operating stake in Jubilee, but the government blocked it. Corruption is the price to pay to operate in Sub-Saharan Africa, and whether foreign companies fall to its temptation or not, makes no difference. They'll fall anyway. That's what happened to Kosmos, and why the Exxon deal didn't go through. The supermajors can't afford this unless oil is at $100 a barrel.

Jubilee was discovered in 2007, putting Ghana on the oil map. The first oil was pumped in 2010, when oil was at a stunning $100/barrel. Then the other shoe dropped. Ghanaians weren't seeing any prosperity from this massively lucrative oil. The government responded by charging Kosmos with corruption, and its local partner with money-laundering. But the even bigger issue was how the field was licensed to Kosmos and local EO Group. In other words, bribery. This is unfolding across Sub-Saharan Africa right now. From Ghana to Guyana, and with Brent at $64, offshore Africa isn't nearly as attractive. Offshore is extremely expensive to develop, without lucrative deals that amount to bribery, and Sub-Saharan Africa has been all too zealous in that department. Now it's time to pay the piper, and that means far fewer takers for some of the world's richest oil fields.

Why Gazprom Is, and Isn't A Good Buy

Gazprom has a market-share problem in Europe, and that problem starts with LNG. And it's not just about foreign LNG competitors, it also has a home-grown problem in the form of Novatek. Novatek managed to supply more LNG to Europe than anyone else did earlier this year, and while Novatek will admit that the two companies are rivals as much as they are partners, the numbers are clear. Gazprom, on the other hand, sees where this wind is blowing. But this is a tricky rivalry because both are Kremlin-backed.

How to resolve this? A shakeup at Gazprom. And no one's really been paying attention. And despite (or because of) that shake-up, Gazprom's shares have been rallying--even though EU natural gas prices have been ticking lower and lower and that will negatively affect Gazprom's valuation and outlook.

But the share price boost was artificial: It came from a Russian Finance Ministry directive for Gazprom (and all other state-owned companies) to pay a minimum of 50% of their profits as dividends to shareholders.

This week, Gazprom released data showing that its natural gas exports outside the FSU (former Soviet Union) dropped by 5.6% since the beginning of this year, and compared to a year ago. Part of the reason has been the fact that companies are saddled with US LNG offtake agreements while the global LNG market is weakening (in terms of price). They're dumping it off on Europe, even at a loss--so it's not just Novatek that Gazprom has to worry about. But Gazprom can't attack the market as a whole. It's not a tangible being. Instead, it's executives have been going after Novatek; they've even accused Novatek of cheating the government on taxes. That's a dangerous accusation to make to a Kremlin-backed company. But it was all Gazprom had left after a forced shakeup in its board of directors earlier this year.

Novatek is on a roll. Since 2013, it's been a growing threat to Gazprom. That was the year that Putin put an end to the Gazprom monopoly and created a little competition in this field, allowing Novatek to increase LNG capacity by three times to this day. Gazprom has failed to predict the global LNG market here--and Novatek has stepped in rather smartly. Sooner than later, it won't be Gazprom that's the Kremlin's biggest political weapon in Europe--it will be Novatek.

An American-Israeli business now stands accused of facilitating the sale of oil from the Kuridsh-controlled area of Syria to the Israelis. But while denying the facilitation of those sales, he also noted that he was trying to keep this oil from getting into Iranian hands, while also decrying that he's not on any side in this conflict. Each of these three things contradict the other. The middleman here, Moti Kahana, says he's an American who does not serve Israel.

Global Oil & Gas Playbook

- Russian authorities have arrested Dmitry Mazurov, former owner of the Antipinsky refinery, Russia's largest independent oil refinery, in a case that is potentially about embezzlement. While prosecutors have not released specific charges, Russian media say Mazurov is accused of embezzling $600 million that had been allocated for refinery construction. In May, the refinery filed for bankruptcy--some $5.5 billion in debt--and a Sberbank JV acquired an 80% stake in the refinery.

- US shale player Carrizo Oil & Gas is selling over to Callon Petroleum for a total of $3.2 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in stock and the rest in debt. This is a merger deal for Texas shale, specifically for the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford. The deal is expected to close in Q4. The merger will produce a company with around 200,000 net acres in both basins, with average production of around 100,000 boepd in Q1 2019.

- It's not Ghana, but it's garnering even less interest from the world's supermajors: Israel's offshore Mediterranean bidding saw only two groups throw their hat in the ring for exploration. One group includes British Cairn Energy, SOCO International and Israeli Ratio Oil. The second group is Energean and Israel Opportunity. There are 19 blocks available, and these two groups bid on 16 of those.

- The European Union is still not moving decisively against Turkey for drilling off the coast of Cyprus. The European Commission will continue to work on possible financial sanctions over two Turkish drilling vessels in Cyprus' EEZ. So far, the only real measure the EU has taken is to cut $165 million in EU from Turkey's pre-accession aid, and to freeze the investment activity of the European Investment Bank in Turkey. They've also cancelled high-level talks with Turkey planned for the economy, energy, transport and agriculture, but that, too, is symbolic at best since these talks had been put on hold as far back as 2016 over other political issues. The EU isn't going to meddle seriously in this issue right now, much to Cyprus' dismay. That's largely because the bloc still needs Turkey for energy transit. Brussels is also concerned that Ankara may play dirty here with migrants, allowing them to illegally travel into Europe in an act of retribution for any real sanctions.

- Keep an eye on the Lake Albert play in Uganda. Before any FDI can be made on this, we need to know what the outcome will be of Tullow's sale to Total SA and China's CNOOC. That's where we'll get to the real development of the estimated billions of barrels of oil at Lake Albert. But we're not convinced that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is going to sign off on this sale. Museveni has given this deal preliminary approval and it was supposed to be done in April. It's still not, and the president keeps dragging his feet. In the meantime, Tullow appears to be contemplating an exit from Uganda altogether. First production here was supposed to be in 2020, and that is now highly unlikely. Tullow has a knack for putting new African oil venues on the map--but after that, keeping them there is a challenge.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'Ghana', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Montana', 'Tripoli', 'Panama', 'Nigeria', 'Niger', 'Italy', 'Israel']",Iran's Oil Tanker Leverage Game | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Irans-Oil-Tanker-Leverage-Game.html,None,
11402195,2019-07-03,"The past week has seen the conflict in Libya take on far greater significance for external actors. The lines have been drawn in the sand here, particularly where it concerns Turkey. In the span of a week, Turkish aid has helped the Government of National Accord (GNA) retake a strategic town south of Libya from the forces of General Haftar, prompting a retaliation of Haftar targeting Turkish nationals and assets in the country. First, they kidnapped six sailors, provoking Erdogan into a frenzy. Then they shot down a Turkish drone in Libya. The sailors, none of whom were military personnel according to our sources in Istanbul, have now been released and remain in Libya. But the real question here is why is Turkey messing around in Libya to the extent of supplying the GNA with firepower and other support?

Turkey considers Libya as a keystone of proxy wars for Mediterranean energy reserves, and rightfully so. Turkish officials who number among our assets in the region have a very different take on Libya than their Western counterparts do. From the Turkish perspective, foreign powers are using the Islamic State (ISIS) in Libya as an excuse to pursue their own national interests. The Turks are retaliating by using the Libyan GNA to serve Ankara's agenda to boost the Muslim Brotherhood in the region (along with ally Qatar, which is also on the anti-Haftar side of this fight). Ankara has been in a bunker mentality in Libya recently, according to an investigative journalist in Istanbul.

Libya's GNA is only surviving at this point thanks to Turkish support, from Ankara's viewpoint. And Ankara isn't necessarily wrong, though it is not the only player in this equation. Haftar now finds himself fighting the Turks as he attempts to take over Tripoli. But Haftar has Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Greece on his side quite tangibly, along with nods from Western powers. This is not an isolated conflict, but the makings of a great regional war.

Turkey's ultimate goal, according to our official sources in Ankara, is to use the GNA to unify Libya in order to reach a deal for maritime demarcation of the Mediterranean. A Turkish Foreign Ministry official told us that such a deal would ""push Greece, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt out of the equation"", and as such is a ""strategic target"". In other words, Libya is the key to Turkey's energy battle with the Greek Cypriots, and with Israel, and this is the sideshow unfolding while Turkey taunts Cyprus with its own drilling offshore in the Cypriot EEZ.

When it comes to Libya, the same official told us that Turkey is ""on the right track"". ""Haftar knows this and tries to push us to make us derail. We won't."" He also derided ""fake news"" originating from the Haftar camp that there were military personnel amongst the six sailors held captive, which he described as ""further evidence that Turkey also faces a smear campaign full of Haftar's fake news to provoke the situation"".

There was a suggestion here that Turkey is willing to take this further, militarily, with the official noting that ""Libya is not as far from Turkey as some think"".

How 700,000 Could Disappear from Libyan Production

Last week, we explained the possibility of Libya halting all oil exports after Haftar's allegations that the GNA is using oil revenues from the Central Bank in Tripoli to pay off militias.

The million-dollar question is, of course, will it happen? That's what the markets want to know. The likelihood here is that if it does happen, it will not target the entirety of Libyan oil production; rather, it will target 700,000 bpd that comes out of the country's east.

The head of the Tripoli-based NOC is now lauding an increase in Libyan oil production to 1.3M barrels per day, but he's clearly worried about the 700,000 bpd that he says the parallel government in the east is now attempting to sell unilaterally, at below-market prices. This 700,000 bpd is at the oil terminals in the 'Crescent' - all controlled by Haftar. This is the immediate oil that Haftar would freeze if he makes good on his threat.

In the meantime, if the GNA is indeed using NOC Tripoli oil funds to pay off militias, Haftar will be worried about Tuesday's report recording $2.3 billion from sales of crude oil and derived products, along with taxes and royalties for May. That's a 24% increase over the previous month.

Aramco IPO Back in Full Swing

MBS has not forgotten about the Aramco IPO - part of his legacy, despite advisors who consistently fight against it. Preparations to list Aramco are again underway. There were indications as early as last week when the Kingdom very publicly cut Aramco's spending on the oil ministry. This is a move designed to show investors that there is a degree of separation between state and company and that once Aramco goes public it won't be funding hotel expenses for the oil minister, among other things. This week, it has emerged that Aramco has been meeting with investment banks to get the IPO back on track. The atmosphere for this still is not ideal. MBS has not yet managed to shore up his damaged reputation over the Khashoggi murder, and if 2020 elections in the U.S. end up producing a Democratic president, all bets on fixing that reputation may be lost. MBS is hoping the conflict with Iran, helped by continually Israeli pushing, will aide in his reputational needs.

Global Oil & Gas Playbook

- Novatek - Russia's biggest private gas producer - has sold a 10% stake its upcoming project, Arctic LNG2, to Japanese consortium partners JOGMEC and Mitsui & Co. The project will liquefy natural gas in Russia, with commencement expected in 2023. The target markets for this LNG are Asia and Europe. Novatek estimates the entire project development cost to be $23 billion.

- In a major port deal, Dubai-based DP World - one of the largest port operators in the world - has acquired marine logistics company Dubai-based Topaz Energy and Marine in a deal worth $1 billion. Topaz has a fleet of 117 vessels and operates in the Caspian Sea, the Middle East and West Africa. Topaz had a backlog of $1.6 billion in contracts at the end of March. It works with everyone from Exxon to Aramco.

- Marathon Oil has now fully exited the UK, closing the sale of its UK operations, which consists of the Brae area fields and Foinaven, to UK independent producer RockRose Energy PLC for $95 million. Last year, Marathon company boasted 21.4 Mmboe of proved reserves in the UK, with some 13,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day Boe/d of production.

- State-owned Kuwait Oil and Halliburton have signed a $597 million contract to explore for oil off the coast of Kuwait, looking to add another estimated 100,000 barrels to the country's daily production capacity. Kuwait currently pumps as much as 3 million barrels of oil a day from its wholly-owned fields with target a daily capacity of 4 million barrels by 2020.

- Iran has now breached the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump abandoned. Iran wants to maintain the deal, and this new game is now about leverage over that same deal. In order to get the deal back on track, it has to break the deal first. Europe has not managed to fulfill its commitments to Iran to save this deal, so Tehran must act on its own. This isn't about Iran making a nuclear weapon - it's about salvaging the nuclear deal. It's about restoring sanctions waivers. It's not about war. And there are signs that Iran's brinkmanship may be working. There are indications that the State Department is considering a loophole that would allow China to import oil from Iran in very quiet talks.

- Venezuela is exporting increasing volumes of heavy crude to China (it's primary market now), which has seen June's export figures recover somewhat from the previous month. The country has shifted to largely producing Merey heavy crude to make up for the huge drop in exports of other grades and refined products. Merey heavy crude is the preferred grade in China.

- An airstrike on a migrant center outside Tripoli has killed 44 people. Haftar claims that the GNA launched the strike, while the GNA claims it was Haftar. The level of carnage in this attack, and the fact that this was not a strategic target in this conflict suggest it was intended to get the attention of the UN. The greater likelihood (with no evidence as of yet) is that the GNA and its proxies intended for this attack to be blamed on Haftar at a time when the UN is looking to examine the Central Bank's documents for indications that they are paying off militia with oil revenues in the war effort against Haftar.

- The dust has not yet settled on Algeria's political instability in the wake of the resignation of Bouteflika and the installation of an interim leadership that has seen the military clan gain power from the presidential clan, but Italian Eni seems confident that it's all systems go now. Eni has met with Algerian state-run Sonatrach to discuss fast-tracking the development of new oil and gas projects in North Berkine, the first phase (oil focused) of which started up in May. The second phase is now expected to launch in September (gas focused). The second phase is awaiting the completion of a pipeline.

- Also in Algeria, a fire broke out Tuesday at the country's massive Arzew energy complex, hosting three LNG facilities, a refinery and a petrochemicals plant.

11402196,2019-06-27,"Forces of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord in Libya have seized a town near Tripoli that served as the main supply base for the Libyan National Army of General Khalifa Haftar who is fighting the GNA for control of the capital.

Reuters reported the news quoting witnesses, noting the takeover of the town of Gharyan is a serious blow to Haftar's forces, which are affiliated with the rival eastern government of Libya. The LNA launched an attack on Tripoli in April and fighting has been going on since then without any significant advances by either side.

The GNA-affiliated forces, according to the Reuters sources, stormed Gharyan early in the morning on Wednesday in a surprise attack that ensured their success. The LNA was forced out of the town and the GNA army took over its central operations room, field hospitals, and a helicopter base.

The LNA, however, has one more base in the vicinity, in the town of Tarhouna, which it could use to launch a response to the taking of Gharyan or continue its advance on Tripoli.

Ever since the fighting started in April, Libya's National Oil Corporation has been warning that hostilities could threaten production, and this time, the situation could be worse than at the start of the civil war in 2011. The threat is rising at a time when NOC is making progress towards recovering Libya's oil production after a slump following the civil war. Without the outages, the country produces about 1 million bpd.

At the same time, despite the fighting, the country's production could double in five years. Right now, despite the deterioration in its security situation, Libya exported more oil during the second quarter of the year, according to data from IHS Markit, at an average of 960,000 bpd. That's 40 percent above the average for the first quarter when the Sharara field -- Libya's largest -- was offline.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Gharyan', 'Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Tarhuna']",Libya's GNA Deals Blow To Haftar Forces Outside Tripoli | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyas-GNA-Deals-Blow-To-Haftar-Forces-Outside-Tripoli.html,None,
11402197,2019-05-08,"Oil prices have fallen sharply on fears of a global economic slowdown, but the markets are overlooking the possibility of a serious outage in Libya as civil war drags on.

It may be ard to maintain attention to any one conflict, with so many now raging around the world. Last week, the Trump administration was all-in on Venezuela. But with the coup failing, Washington has turned its sights on Iran.

However, more than a month after the Libyan National Army (LNA) assaulted Tripoli, defying the UN and the international community, the fighting continues. The head of the militia, Khalifa Haftar, had hoped for a swift conquest, but instead has run into a stalemate. ""Despite the advantage of access to high-tech munitions seemingly supplied in violation of the UN arms embargo on Libya, the LNA does not seem to have the strategy, logistics or manpower sufficient to defeat the GNA and the various western-Libya militia that are supporting it against Haftar,"" Standard Chartered wrote in a report. The GNA refers to the Government of National Accord, the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli.

As of now, the humanitarian crisis is growing worse. Hundreds of people have been killed and more than 60,000 have fled. The World Health Organization is sounding the alarm on a shortage of medical supplies, and the potential for a cholera outbreak as violence continues in the country.

The longer the war lasts, the more likely the country's oil flows will breakdown. ""As Chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corp., I cannot foresee any scenario, other than an immediate ceasefire, in which Libya's oil exports are not severely impacted by the conflict,"" Mustafa Sanalla, head of Libya's National Oil Corp., wrote in an op-ed for Bloomberg Opinion.

In fact, he says that the fighting has already impacted Libya's oil sector. On April 10, a bomb hit one of the NOC's oil facilities outside of Tripoli, sparking a fire. Meanwhile, oil fields in the country's south are experiencing shortages, Sanalla said. The fields need fuel and other supplies in order to maintain operations. An oil worker was abducted near Sirte, while others have suffered from threats. The assault takes a toll on the workforce.

The LNA has even seized an airport at one of the NOC's oil export terminals, and the militia has tried to commandeer vessels in order to use them in the military campaign. ""While we are as determined as ever to oppose attempts to depict NOC as partisan in this conflict, we are in no position to resist this sort of military pressure,"" Sanalla warned.

But it gets worse. Sanalla said that the NOC's oil has begun to be sold illegally. If various factions begin funding their operations from the illicit sale of oil, civil war and instability may only grow worse. With the LNA and GNA at war, ISIS militants can regroup and strengthen, Sanalla said.

U.S. President Trump's about-face has arguably made things much worse. The policy of the U.S. government had been to support diplomatic negotiations, and Washington has gone to lengths to avoid picking sides. Trump, out of nowhere, lent his support to Haftar's assault on Tripoli after taking a phone call with him. That has muddled the international response to the fighting and granted a sense of legitimacy to the LNA's attack on Tripoli. Ultimately, reconciliation, or even a cease-fire, has become increasingly unlikely.

Ultimately, Libya's success at restoring oil production to over 1 million barrels per day (mb/d) - and reaching a multi-year high of 1.26 mb/d in March - rested on the fact that neither side had control over Libya's oil system. Sanalla said that this ""dual-key"" approach was critical - an arrangement in which the LNA guaranteed security at ports and oil fields, and the GNA held a monopoly on the legal authority over oil exports. With those powers divided, neither side could seize control of the entire system. If the GNA tried to withhold payments to east of the country, the LNA could block the ports. If the LNA tried to export oil on its own, the GNA could withhold payments.

The civil war puts the entire system at risk. ""[W]e think it unlikely that the arrangement can survive a protracted stalemate and the associated weakening of the LNA,"" Standard Chartered wrote in its report. ""In our view there is a high risk that Libyan outages could add another 1mb/d loss to the 1.9mb/d y/y reduction from Iran and Venezuela.""

The latest concern for oil traders is the dramatic escalation of the U.S.-China trade war, and for good reason. But while the global economy could be hit with a trade shock, the physical market for crude is tight...and in danger of more disruptions.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Venezuela', 'Iran', 'Sirte', 'United States']",The Biggest Catalyst In Oil Markets Is Going Unnoticed | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Africa/The-Biggest-Catalyst-In-Oil-Markets-Is-Going-Unnoticed.html,None,
11402198,2019-04-07,"Libya is heading for a military showdown as East Libyan strongman General Haftar has initiated a full confrontation with the UN-backed West-Libyan GNA Al Serraj government, based in Tripoli. After prolonged military operations in Eastern and Southern Libya, Haftar's forces and militant groups, all combined under the LNA (Libyan National Army) are now heading to Libya's former capital Tripoli. For months, the LNA has experienced success after success, removing not only extremist Islamic terrorist groups hiding in remote regions of Libya but also taking full control of most the country's only real revenue generator, its oil and gas fields. Haftar has been long been preparing for this last showdown in Tripoli.

Backed by several Arab countries, such as Egypt and the UAE, with tacit support (both military and political) from Russia, Haftar gave the order to take Tripoli on Wednesday. LNA troops have taken several major cities around Tripoli, encircling Libya's capital. The international community, led by the UN, is feverishly trying to quell the risk of a full-scale military confrontation between the two parties, with the scheduled elections now having been cancelled. France, Italy, the UK and even Russia have stated that a military solution is to the crisis in Libya is out of the question. The leader of the GNA, Al Serraj, officially backed by the UN and Western countries, can only rely on military support from the Misrata militias, Turkey and Qatar.

Looking at the situation on the ground, it appears that Haftar is paying little attention to these calls from the UN. LNA forces are close to Tripoli, preparing for a possible full-scale attack, with some news agencies reporting that some LNA operations have been pushed back by GNA loyalists.

In the coming hours and days the future of Libya may well be decided. Taking into account the overall military situation, it seems clear that Haftar's LNA will be able to take Tripoli by force if needed, but it remains unclear what would happen after such an operation. The role of Haftar as a potential strongman or leader of a new Libya will depend not on his military strength but increasingly in the coming months on the deals he is able to make with several other tribes and strongmen in the country. Some even argue that Haftar's encirclement of Tripoli at present is not a military move but a political one to put pressure on the Al Serraj GNA government to take a step back. Strategically, that move makes a lot of sense as the UN is still preparing to hold a conference later this month in the southwestern city of Ghadames to discuss a political solution to prepare for long-delayed elections and avoid a military showdown. With this in mind, Haftar has urged his forces to enter Tripoli without using force.

While his move may have surprised some analysts and the UN, Haftar's move is one that we have been pointing to for weeks. In recent weeks, the LNA has taken over and secured Libya's main oil and gas infrastructure and ports, while sending troops to the south to remove the remaining pockets of Daesh, Al Qaida and foreign operators and smugglers. By securing the main revenue generators of the Libyan economy, Haftar has not only gotten the attention of international governments and investors, but he is also now able to pay for loyalty and services from the remaining tribes and militant groups. The growing attractiveness of the LNA as the main power broker in the country has already diminished support for the GNA government and militants in and around Tripoli. For now, the GNA continues to hold its positions in Tripoli and Misrata.

The threat of a renewed bloody civil war in the western region however, does not only emanate from the tensions between the GNA government and Haftar's LNA military powers. Libya, after the forceful removal of former dictator Muammar Ghaddafi by the West, has become a dangerous mix of regional and international actors, all positioning themselves to take a piece of the cake (oil and gas) in the future. It has been a very long road for General Haftar to gain the upper hand in this geopolitical game of thrones. He has been able to secure major economic and military support deals with Egypt, the UAE and Russia. At present, Arab, Russian and European corporations and governments are weighing their options and deciding upon how they can best position themselves in the Libyan power struggle.

The Al Serraj government (GNA) is still being backed by the UN, EU and some Western countries. However, without strong support from Turkey and Qatar, Tripoli would have been on its knees long ago. The Libyan internal conflict is an extension of the Saudi-Egypt-UAE vs Turkey-Qatar conflict.

One unpredictable factor in this power struggle is Moscow. While Russia has been openly courting Haftar, who has been a regular visitor and prominent guest in Moscow, Russian official statements call for a diplomatic solution. Kremlin spokesman Peskov reiterated that ""the most important thing is that military operations there do not lead to bloodshed"". The official standpoint of Haftar's other key supporter, the UAE, is also to ""show restrain"".

At present it is not clear which strategy Haftar is going to pursue. A full, but prolonged, conflict with the GNA in Tripoli is unlikely. Supply lines and the current support of LNA aligned militias will come under pressure if the battle takes too long. While Haftar holds the power over almost all of Libya's oil and gas infrastructure, he still doesn't have power over Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) or the Central Bank, where all export revenues flow. Another factor to consider is that a prolonged conflict would stretch Haftar's forces, leaving him vulnerable to possible adversaries in the east, his current power base.

The Libyan situation, regardless of how it develops, will generate additional bullish sentiment for oil markets. The possibility of a military conflict, which could spread to LNA held oil and gas regions, Libya's overall production and export capacity will take a hit. OPEC's production cut strategy will be even more effective if additional Libyan volumes are taken out of the market. As global oil demand is still growing, supply issues will be increasingly bullish. Haftar has once again made the oil markets sit up and watch.

When looking at the looming crisis in Algeria, Libya's neighbor, one could argue that a Haftar victory in Libya could be a blessing in disguise for the oil market. A strong leader controlling Libya after 5 years of turmoil would likely stabilize oil flow from the country and calm markets.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Ghadames', 'Turkey', 'Qatar', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'Moscow']",Oil Markets On Edge As Military Clash Looms In Libya | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Markets-On-Edge-As-Military-Clash-Looms-In-Libya.html,None,
11402477,2019-08-15,"All attention is focused on the twists-and-turns of the very noisy US-Iran dispute in the Persian Gulf, but all the while the People's Republic of China (PRC) is rapidly and quietly consolidating a dominant presence in the area with the active support of Russia.

Beijing, as a result, is fast acquiring immense influence over related key dynamics such as the price of oil in the world market and the relevance of the petrodollar. The PRC and the Russians are capitalizing on both the growing fears of Iran and the growing mistrust of the US. Hence, the US is already the main loser of the PRC's gambit.

The dramatic PRC success can be attributed to the confluence of two major trends:

(1) The quality and relevance of what Beijing can offer to both Iran and the Saudi-Gulf States camp; and

(2) The decision of key Arab leaders -- most notably Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin 'Abd al-'Aziz al Sa'ud (aka MBS) and his close ally, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (aka MBZ) -- to downgrade their traditional close ties with the US, and reach out to Beijing to provide a substitute strategic umbrella.

Hence, the PRC offer to oversee and guarantee the establishment of a regional collective security regime -- itself based on the Russian proposals and ideas first raised in late July 2019 -- is now getting considerable positive attention from both shores of the Persian Gulf. Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman appear to be becoming convinced that the PRC could be the key to the long-term stability and prosperity in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula.

Iran is also considering the expansion of security cooperation with Russia as an added umbrella against potential US retaliation.

Overall, according to sources in these areas, the US was increasingly perceived as an unpredictable, disruptive element.

The profound change in the attitude of the Saudi and Emirati ruling families, who for decades have considered themselves pliant protégés of the US, took long to evolve. However, once formulated and adopted, the new policies have been implemented swiftly.

The main driving issue is the realization by both MBS and MBZ that, irrespective of the reassuring rhetoric of US Pres. Donald Trump and Jared Kushner, their bitter nemesis -- Qatar -- is far more important to the US than the rest of the conservative Arab monarchies and sheikhdoms of the GCC. The last straw came in early July 2019 in the aftermath of the visit of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to Washington, DC. Sheikh Tamim received an extravagant reception from both Pres. Trump in person and official Washington. Trump lavished praises on Qatar and the Emir, and emphasized the US renewed commitment ""to further advancing the high-level strategic cooperation between our two countries"".

There are good reasons for the US preference of Qatar.

The Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar is by far the most important US base in the entire greater Middle East. Qatar is mediating between the US and several nemeses, including Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. Qatar is providing ""humanitarian cash"" to HAMAS in the Gaza Strip, thus buying quiet time for Israel. Qatar has given generous ""political shelter"" to numerous leaders, seniors, and commanders of questionable entities the US would like to protect but would never acknowledge this (including anti-Russia Chechens and other Caucasians, and anti-China Uighurs).

Qatari Intelligence is funding and otherwise supporting the various jihadist entities which serve as proxies of the CIA and M?T (Milli ?stihbarat Te?kilat?: the Turkish National Intelligence Organization) in the greater Middle East (mainly Syria, Iraq, Libya, Jordan, Yemen) and Central Asia (mainly Afghanistan-Pakistan, China's Xinjiang and Russia's Caucasus and the Turkic peoples of eastern Siberia).

On top of this, Qatar is purchasing billions of dollars' worth of US-made weapons; and paying cash on-time (unlike the habitually late Saudis who now cannot afford to pay what they've already promised).

Moreover, the Middle East is awash with rumors that Qatari businessmen saved the financial empire of the Kushner family by investing at least half-a-billion dollars in the 666 5th Avenue project in New York. The rumors are very specific in that the investment was made for political reasons on instruction of the Emir. In the conspiracies-driven Arab Middle East, such rumors are believed and serve as a viable motive for the policies of the Trump White House: an ulterior motive the Saudis and Gulfies cannot challenge.

The handling by the Trump White House of the Iranian shootdown of the US RQ-4A/BAMS-D Global Hawk drone on June 20, 2019, only exacerbated further the anguish of both MBS and MBZ. Both of them, along with other Arab leaders, urged the Trump White House to strike hard at Iran in retaliation. Both MBS and MBZ communicated in person with the most senior individuals at the White House. They were stunned to learn that Trump communicated directly with Tehran on the possibility of a largely symbolic retaliatory strike, and the prospects of bilateral negotiations.

Both MBS and MBZ consider the last-minute cancellation of the US retaliatory strike a personal affront and humiliation because Trump did not accept and follow their positions and demands for action. Both MBS and MBZ are now convinced that not only the US demonstrated weakness and lack of resolve, but that Pres. Trump was personally not committed to fighting Iran on behalf of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf sheikhdoms.

Furthermore, there is growing trepidation in Saudi Arabia about the viability of the Pakistani guarantees to the Kingdom, particularly concerning nuclear deterrence.

In the past, Islamabad mediated the Saudi purchase of ballistic missiles from the PRC (procurements which are supported by Pakistani military technicians and security personnel) and had allocated two nuclear warheads for launch from Saudi Arabia in case of an Iranian attack, all in return for lavish Saudi funding of Pakistan's nuclear and strategic weapons programs.

However, there has been a profound turnaround in Pakistani policies starting in the Summer of 2019.

First, Pakistan reached a comprehensive military agreement with Turkey with the latter providing weapons and other military systems, as well as training, in order to replace US and Western systems which were no longer available. In the first area of active cooperation, Turkey mediated modalities for trilateral cooperation (Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan) in fighting Baluchi jihadists and insurgents. Second, Pakistan is expediting the shipping of huge quantities of Iranian gas to western China by mainly using existing pipelines, from the Fars fields to Chabahar, then via the Iran-Pakistan pipeline to Gwadar, and then via the CPEC (the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) pipeline to Xinjiang. As well, Iran and Pakistan cooperate closely in negotiations with various Afghan factions to ameliorate any US achievements in the Doha negotiations with the Taliban.

Hence, both MBS and MBZ wonder, can Saudi Arabia trust Pakistan to deter and confront Iran and its allies on behalf of Saudi Arabia?

Concurrently, with the face-off with the US not going away, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamene'i convened anew the key Iranian leaders in order to reiterate the tenets of Tehran's strategy and to reinforce their resolve. Khamene'i stressed his and Iran's commitment to becoming the leading regional power, and repeated that there was no possibility for a negotiated compromise with the US. In the meeting, Khamene'i stated ""three directives for Iran"" which were to be followed and realized under any condition. As reported by authoritative commentator Elijah Magnier, Khamene'i's directives are:

""1. Adherence to Iran's right to nuclear enrichment and everything related to this science at all costs. Nuclear enrichment is a sword Iran can hold in the face of the West, which wants to take it from Tehran. It is Iran's card to obstruct any US intention of 'obliterating' Iran.

""2. Continue to develop Iran's missile capability and ballistic programs. This is Iran's deterrent weapon that prevents its enemies from waging war against it. Sayyed Ali Khamene'i considers the missile program a balancing power to prevent harm against Iran.

""3. Support Iran's allies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, and never abandon them, because they are essential to Iran's national security.""

Elijah Magnier further explained that ""Sayyed Khamene'i recommended these commandments to preserve the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that each of these three items is equally important for the safety of Iran, its existence and continuity, and national and strategic security.""

The aggregate objective of these three directives, Khamene'i elaborated, was to enable and expedite the ascent of Iran as a regional power. The Iranian strategic ascent would manifest itself by tight control over both the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab al Mandab, as well as the entire Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea; that is, controlling the region's oil and gas exports. Emboldened, the Iranians would intensify their demands for the return of ""traditional Iranian territory"", starting with Bahrain [even though the Iranian Government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi had formally relinquished its claim on Bahrain in 1970 -- Ed.].

There can be expected to be growing demands from Tehran to empower the Shi'ite population of the eastern Arabian Peninsula -- where all the oil and gas reserves are located -- in accordance with Iran's long-term commitment to the establishing of an Islamic Republic of Eastern Arabia. These are all traditional long-term demands of Iran. The novelty in Khamene'i's most recent address is the assertiveness and immediacy of the Iranian quest to meet these demands.

The importance and essence of Khamene'i's message spread across the Persian Gulf quickly. Consequently, both MBS and MBZ are cognizant that Khamene'i's Tehran was unlikely to compromise or go back on these commitments and objectives. There was no similar indication of resolve coming from Trump's Washington. Thus, MBS, MBZ and most other Arab leaders had become increasingly convinced that the US would sooner or later withdraw from the Persian Gulf and the greater Middle East. The current bluster and assertiveness of the Trump Administration could not negate the overall trend: that of the US disengagement and withdrawal.

The Arab leaders believe that the US would empower Israel as a subcontractor, but Israel has its own priorities and vital interests. Michael Young articulated the perception of the region's leaders in the August 7, 2019, issue of The National of the UAE. ""A new regional security order is emerging, with Israel taking a much more interventionist approach and playing a military rôle partly replacing that previously fulfilled by Washington, particularly with regard to Iran. Israel's efforts to counter Iran have paralleled those of a number of Arab states, with all sides adapting to a new situation in which the US has decided to militarily disengage from the Middle East.""

Both MBS and MBZ concluded that they need a far stronger strategic umbrella than the US and Israel could offer in order to survive in the era of Iran's ascent.

As a result, MBZ reached out to Beijing in early July 2019. After comprehensive preparatory negotiations, MBZ arrived in Beijing on July 20, 2019, for a milestone visit in which he met PRC Pres. Xi Jinping for lengthy discussions. According to PRC senior officials, Mohammed bin Zayed and Xi Jinping ""elevated the two countries' relationship to that of a strategic partnership"". The key outcome was the UAE's acceptance of the dominance of the PRC and Russia in the Persian Gulf.

""The UAE and China are moving towards a promising future,"" MBZ said in his concluding meeting with Xi Jinping. His visit aimed at ""developing co-operation and a comprehensive strategic partnership, as well as opening new horizons for joint action in various sectors,"" MBZ explained. Xi Jinping responded by stressing ""the profound significance of China-Arab relations"". The PRC and the UAE would now work closely together to transform the Persian Gulf into ""a security oasis"" rather than a new ""source of turmoil"".

Significantly, Xi Jinping referred to ""a hundred years of grand plan"" when describing the PRC's relations with the UAE. MBZ also signed a large number of bilateral agreements, both economic and strategic.

While in Beijing, Mohammed bin Zayed asked Xi Jinping to mediate a deal with Tehran in order to negate the US-driven escalation and possible war. The PRC moved very fast, and within a few days dispatched to Tehran a high-ranking delegation led by the head of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Song Tao. His mandate was to discuss the new security regime for the Persian Gulf, as well as the conditions for increasing PRC purchase of Iranian oil in disregard of the US sanctions. On the Iranian side, Song Tao's official host was the highly influential Secretary of the Expediency Council, Mohsen Rezaei. This meant that Khamene'i was directly involved. Song Tao stayed in Tehran for three days and met with a large number of senior officials, mostly members of Khamene'i's innermost circle of confidants and advisors.

All the Iranian officials were very assertive regarding Iran's resolve to withstand US pressure at all cost, and eager for PRC cooperation in stabilizing the region and preventing war.

Rezaei articulated Iran's strategy. ""Any kind of insecurity and conflict in this region would carry harm to global peace and security,"" he stated. ""Americans and Britain have been fanning the flames of war in the Persian Gulf region and they want to pretend they have control over the Strait of Hormuz and the movement of vessels. Of course, we do not allow this to happen. In the meantime, we expect cooperation from our friends in China.""

He hoped for Chinese cooperation in preventing escalation. Should such cooperation fail to materialize, Iran would have to act boldly. ""Persian Gulf security is our security and we have to respond to their attacks and destabilizing actions in order to maintain security,"" Rezaei stated. Tehran's preference is for the PRC to help in securing ""free shipping and security in the Persian Gulf"".

The Head of Iran's Foreign Policy Strategic Council, Kamal Kharrazi, reminded Song Tao that ""both Iran and China are opposed to US's unilateralism and hegemony"".

Hence, both countries should work closely together in confronting the US. The Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Ali Larijani, also stressed that close cooperation ""can help counter the US animosity and neutralize its consequences"". He suggested that Russia should be brought into the new security regime in the Persian Gulf. Larijani urged the PRC to expedite its anti-US intervention in the Persian Gulf because ""success of this plan is contingent upon practical steps"". Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif noted ""the two countries' common strategic outlook toward international developments"", and urged close cooperation in order to reverse ""Washington's attempts to impose its own hegemony on the world"".

All the Iranian officials had no problem with some form of rapprochement with the UAE and Saudi Arabia provided they did neither participate in a war against Iran, nor permit the US to use their territory and bases for strikes against Iran and Iranian proxies.

The PRC delegation was impressed by the Iranian eagerness to cooperate and to accept a PRC umbrella.

Song Tao told his interlocutors that ""the mission of the delegation is to strengthen the strategic coordination and dialogue between the two countries and we are willing to confront challenges and problems together"". He agreed with the imperative to jointly confront the US, and accepted the need to move fast jointly. Song Tao concurred that ""there are complicated and rapid developments happening on the international stage that have created challenges for the countries of China and Iran, but our resolve and determination is to support Iran's legal and legitimate rights to development and progress"". Song Tao promised to discuss in Beijing concrete ideas how to improve and expand the PRC's policy of ""long-term strategic"" ties with Iran in view of the current situation in the Persian Gulf.

By now, the PRC Government had already organized the first meeting between Emirati and Iranian senior officials. First, on July 26, 2019, an Emirati ""peace delegation"" arrived in Tehran for secret discussions on the new modalities of bilateral relations, new security regimes in the Persian Gulf and Yemen (from where the UAE is withdrawing to the chagrin of Saudi Arabia), and overall GCC-Iran relations. The emphasis was on crisis management and the prevention of accidental escalation in the Persian Gulf. On July 30, 2019, the UAE dispatched a high-level Coast Guard delegation to Tehran.

Officially, the two sides discussed maritime border control and patrolling in order to avoid misunderstandings and clashes. The delegation included an undeclared senior emissary of MBZ. He assured his Iranian interlocutors that the UAE was ready for a fundamental change of relationship with Iran including a ""rapprochement"" and expansion of trade. The UAE also committed to distancing from the US, accepting PRC influence in the entire region, and working with Iran for a regional security regime.

One of the key issues raised with the Emirati delegation in Tehran was the Saudi position. The UAE emissary asserted that all of the recent activities, including the request for PRC mediation, were the outcome of close coordination between MBZ and MBS. However, he explained, given the close relations between MBS and the Trump White House, MBS felt more constrained in making a dramatic shift the way MBZ did.

Therefore, on July 31, 2019, Zarif offered an olive branch.

He declared that ""Iran is prepared for dialogue if Saudi Arabia is also ready"". He repeated the message in an interview with the official IRNA. ""If Saudi Arabia is ready for talks, Iran is always ready for negotiation with neighbors,"" Zarif stated. Tehran ""is interested in cooperation with [her] neighbors."" Just to be on the safe side, the next day -- August 1, 2019 -- Iran sent a reminder of the alternative. The Houthis launched a ballistic missile attack on Saudi military positions near Dammam city.

Located in the Shi'ite area on the shores of the Persian Gulf, Dammam is a critical center of the Saudi oil infrastructure, including a major oil port. Riyadh got the message. Hence, on August 3, 2019, the UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash stated that ""the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia prefer a political approach to their problems with Iran"".

Iran acted on the message. High-level emissaries traveled secretly to Mecca in early August 2019 as part of the Iranian delegation to prepare for the Hajj (August 9-14, 2019). They held secret talks about the future of the Persian Gulf with Saudi senior officials. These talks were personally supervised and micromanaged by MBS, who made all the decisions and determined the Saudi positions. Although the Saudis were forthcoming, and repeatedly expressed their desire to avoid escalation and fighting, they were also reticent to break with the US.

Simply put, the Saudis -- reflecting the persona of MBS -- were risk-averse and incapable of making concrete decisions. They neither said ""no"" to anything, nor did they commit to anything concrete.

The Iranian negotiators were encouraged by the overall spirit of the negotiations, but frustrated with the slow progress of the discussions. Therefore, on August 7, 2019, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif taunted Riyadh. He urged Saudi Arabia to make its own decision rather than be subservient to the US.

""Some countries see their future and security hinged upon dependence and regard security as something purchasable, and think that they can maintain their security by paying money and buying weapons and learn nothing from history,"" Zarif said. ""How come [Saudi Arabia] did not realize that money does not bring security?"" The Saudi posture is in stark contrast to the posture of the Islamic Republic of Iran. ""We never buy security, nor do we sell security because we derive our security, development, and legitimacy from [our] people,"" Zarif concluded.

One of the reasons Tehran felt confident to prod both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi was that both were by now engulfed in a major crisis concerning the US. For a long time, MBS, MBZ and their close aides suspected that the US was hiding major matters from them. While the Trump White House kept demanding uncompromising confrontation with Tehran and warning against any and all contacts, MBS and MBZ suspected that Washington was not itself following these principles. Both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have long known about active channels and mediation efforts by Doha, but whenever the subject came up, Trump's Washington would assure them that the Qatar channel was only procedural and not much different from the US interests office in the Swiss Embassy in Tehran.

Then, on August 5, 2019, the US Ambassador to Iraq, Matthew Tueller, dropped the bomb.

""We have direct communication channels with Tehran,"" he acknowledged. And these are not simple channels. While diplomatic discussions and de facto negotiations are taking place via the good services of Doha, the back-channel in Baghdad was specifically with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC: Pasdaran) Qods Force. These contacts were aimed to minimize the likelihood of clashes and misunderstandings in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf. This venue was most logical because the local Iranian Ambassador is Brig. Gen. Iraj Masjedi who is the right-hand man and deputy of Qods Force Commander Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

According to Iraqi senior officials, some of the US-Iranian communications regarding the aftermath of the shoot-down of the US drone were held via this venue. The US also used this channel to try and convince Tehran not to attack the US forces in al-Tanf (southern Syria) and in the Ein al-Assad Air Base and adjacent bases (western Iraq).

Both Riyadh and Doha were stunned and humiliated because the Trump White House did not bother to inform them of the Baghdad back-channel, while pressuring them to avoid all contacts and negotiations with Iran.

Another reason for the growing self-confidence and assertiveness of Iran was the most recent evolution of its strategic relations with Russia. On July 28, 2019, the Commander of the Iranian Navy, Rear Adm. Hossein Khanzadi, was in Russia, ostensibly for the Navy Day celebrations. He conducted major discussions about a new level of military cooperation specifically in order to counter the US Navy threats.

At the end of the visit, Khanzadi reported in Tehran: ""Iranian and Russian armed forces have signed a 'classified' deal to expand cooperation through a series of projects, one of which will be joint military drills in the Persian Gulf before the end of the year."" ""Some articles of this agreement are classified, but overall, it is aimed at expanding military cooperation between the two countries.""

Khanzadi termed the new agreements a ""turning point"" in the ""military-to-military ties between Iran and Russia"". The agreement includes Russian-Iranian joint naval maneuvers to be held in the northern part of the Indian Ocean and in the Strait of Hormuz before the end of 2019. A major part of the classified agreement concerned giving the Russian Navy base-level installations in the Iranian Navy facilities in Chabahar, Bandar-e-Bushehr, and in the Strait of Hormuz (Bandar-e-Jask and/or Bandar Abbas).

The Russian Navy would also be able to use a Naval Aviation airbase near Bandar-e-Bushehr. In addition to technical, logistics and communications personnel, Russia would keep in these bases SPETSNAZ detachments for both local security and the ability to help Russian and allied ships in distress in the Persian Gulf.

On August 3, 2019, Khamene'i's closest aides conducted sensitive talks with a secret delegation of Russian officials. Tehran wanted to ascertain the Russian reaction to a US attack on Iran in case of a major escalation. ""[An] attack on Iran would be an attack on Russia,"" the Russians stated without equivocation. Hence, Khamene'i formally approved and ratified the new agreements with Russia on August 4, 2019. Khamene'i also authorized follow-up high-level discussions in Moscow about jointly implementing the Russian ""proposed security plan for the Persian Gulf"", while adapting it to the new agreement with the PRC. The first rounds of discussions took place on August 6-7, 2019.

Russia, it was clear, had no problem with the new PRC rôle and stature in the Persian Gulf.

Meanwhile, the continued contacts with Washington reinforced Tehran's conviction that a major confrontation in the greater Middle East remained possible despite the day-to-day cooling down of the situation in the Persian Gulf. Khamene'i instructed better coordination of the diplomatic and military preparations for the next phase.

The new challenge for the IRGC was to up-date the contingency plans for the confrontation and war with the US and Israel under the new conditions where the US could no longer use bases in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain (on top of Qatar and Iraq which had long ago announced they would not permit the US to use their territories and installations for strikes against Iran). It was imperative for the Qods Force to ascertain firsthand how confident Tehran was about the new position of the Arab royals from across the Gulf.

As a result, on August 6, 2019, Qassem Soleimani met Mohammed Javad Zarif at the Foreign Ministry in downtown Tehran.

They discussed coordination of forthcoming regional crises and diplomatic initiatives. They agreed that the current dynamic vis-à-vis the US could lead to either a US capitulation and withdrawal, or to a major escalation all over the greater Middle East. Soleimani believed the latter option was more likely. Therefore, Soleimani and Zarif discussed how to better utilize the Russian and PRC umbrella to not only shield Iran against US onslaught, but to also convince the Arab states to stay out of the fighting.

Soleimani assured Zarif that ""the IRGC's Qods Force is fully supportive of the diplomatic apparatus of the country in all encounters against the US harsh policies"". In a brief photo-op, Soleimani addressed the newly-imposed US sanctions on Zarif, and ""congratulated the Foreign Minister on becoming a target of the US anger and animosity because of [his] affiliation with [the] Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamene'i"".

In early August 2019, the Gulf sheikhdoms and Saudi Arabia agreed to seek and accept the PRC umbrella as proposed to them, and so notified Beijing. According to the plan, the PRC would provide an overall umbrella capable of containing and restraining the US, while Russia would join China in calming down Iran and ameliorating threats to the Arabs.

Among the Arab leaders involved, Mohammed bin Zayed was the most enthusiastic and active in embracing the new regional order which was effectively anti-US. Mohammad bin Salman followed, but somewhat hesitantly. MBS was afraid to acknowledge the collapse of what he had perceived to be his close personal relations with the upper-most echelons of the Trump White House: that is, Trump and Kushner.

On August 6, 2019, the PRC Ambassador to Tehran, Chang Hua, delivered the decision of the Forbidden City to play the active and leading rôle in the establishment of a new regime of collective security in the Persian Gulf.

Beijing was convinced, he stated, that ""any projects and initiatives that aim to strengthen security in the Persian Gulf must be proposed and carried out by the regional countries themselves"". Chang Hua explained that ""the Chinese side, as President Xi Jinping has said, is hopeful that the Persian Gulf will remain a region of peace and security"". The PRC was ready to actively contribute to the sustenance of peace and security in this crucial area. ""The Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz are the most critical channel and gateway in the world for transferring energy; therefore, they are significant for the world's policy-making, security and economy,"" Chang Hua concluded.

The PRC also started to implement specific undertakings.

First came the decision to increase the importation of Iranian oil, not only to help an ally in distress, but also as an affront to the United States. According to PRC senior officials in Beijing: ""China continues oil imports from Iran to show independence from US sanctions."" The PRC also agreed to purchase oil with yuans, euros, and other currencies in order to reduce their vulnerability to US financial sanctions. The PRC would continue to import its Iranian crude via at least a dozen Iranian tankers also in order to demonstrate to all that ""China [is] a country powerful enough to bust US sanctions"".

Moreover, the anticipated large-scale PRC imports of Iranian crude would have a major impact on the price of oil. Experts in the US and Europe concluded that under such circumstances, the oil price could sink by as much as $30 a barrel. The experts worried that the PRC might decide to purchase large quantities of Iranian oil as a retaliation for the trade/tariff war with the US.

""This decision would both undermine US foreign policy and cushion the negative terms-of-trade effects on the Chinese economy of rising US tariffs,"" concluded a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report. Significantly, the original price estimate discussed between the US and Saudi Arabia was $60 a barrel. That estimate was based on the idea that increased Saudi and US oil production would fill the gap created by the imposition of the US sanctions on Iranian oil. But the PRC commitment to buying more Iranian oil invalidated this plan. Thus, while the UAE was willing to accept such a price drop as a necessary evil needed to prevent a calamitous regional war, Saudi Arabia was furious, given its financial woes which the oil price hike could have eased.

Meanwhile, also on August 6, 2019, the PRC Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Ni Jian, formally informed Abu Dhabi that, should there be a deterioration in the security situation, the PRC's PLA Navy would start escorting tankers and other commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf. ""If there happens to be a very unsafe situation, we will consider having our navy escort our commercial vessels,"" Ni Jian stated.

Officially, Beijing did not rule out coordination with the US-led initiative to escort tankers through the Strait of Hormuz. However, given the PRC commitment to buying and shipping Iranian oil that the US initiative was intended to prevent, the prospects for PRC cooperation would probably be nil. Ni Jian emphasized the PRC support for regional security arrangements and regional negotiations of the type the UAE has with Iran. ""We have the position that all disputes should be sorted by peaceful means and by political discussions, not ... military actions,"" Ni Jian concluded.

Beijing's agreeing to assume a major, and, for the PRC, unprecedented, rôle in the Persian Gulf comes at a crucial time for the PLA.

On July 28, 2019, the PRC issued a major White Paper titled China's National Defense in the New Era. The document constituted an authoritative statement regarding the PRC's military reforms and strategic aspirations under the leadership of Xi Jinping.

For the first time, an official PRC defense document acknowledged the rivalry with the US military and clearly articulated China's long-term goal to confront and challenge ""US dominance"". These goals would be attained through, among other things, the expansion of the PRC ""power projection capabilities"", particularly the Navy's. The White Paper heralded a significant shift in maritime strategy from ""near seas defense"" to ""the combination of near seas defense and far seas protection"". Adopting the ""far seas"" strategy, the White Paper stated, would enable the PRC to ""build itself into a maritime power"".

Xi Jinping's longer-term objective was for the PLA to become a global force. With the new rôle in the Persian Gulf, Xi Jinping's PRC was taking a major step toward attaining this goal.

11402479,2019-03-15,"Growing instability in Venezuela, and the potential of a slowdown in U.S. shale, has pushed oil prices up to multi-month highs this week.

Oil prices have surged to their highest level in months, with WTI rising above $58 per barrel and Brent trading north of $67. The instability in Venezuela and the growing evidence of a slowdown in U.S. shale have pushed prices up.

U.S. production dips. Weekly figures show that U.S. oil production dipped to 12 mb/d last week, down from 12.1 mb/d the week before. The figures are just estimates, and are rounded off to the nearest 100,000 bpd, but they at least offer an indication that the explosive growth could be slowing down.

Venezuela's Guaido proposes liberalizing oil sector. Opposition leader and self-proclaimed president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, is working on overhauling the country's oil sector if he gains power. The proposal would include weakening PDVSA and allowing a vastly larger role for private sector companies. The reforms would resemble those of Mexico over the past few years and would amount to a historic change, although for now, Guiado is still struggling to gain power.

OPEC lowered output in February. OPEC reduced production by 221,000 bpd in February, a more modest reduction than in prior months. Most of the reductions came from Venezuela, which saw output drop by 142,000 bpd. Meanwhile, OPEC estimated that OECD inventories rose by 22 million barrels in January, or 19 million barrels above the five-year average.

IEA: OPEC's spare capacity a ""cushion"" for oil market. The IEA said that although the crisis in Venezuela is disrupting the oil market, the OPEC+ production cuts have rebuilt spare capacity, providing a ""supply cushion"" that can offset the turmoil. ""Much of this spare capacity is composed of crude oil similar in quality to Venezuela's exports,"" the IEA said. ""Therefore, in the event of a major loss of supply from Venezuela, the potential means of avoiding serious disruption to the oil market is theoretically at hand.""

U.S. hints at Iran waivers extension. The Trump administration's lead envoy on Iran sanctions, Brian Hook, said that waivers granted to eight countries importing Iranian oil could be extended, as long as they demonstrate reductions in purchases. The U.S. is aiming to get Iran's oil exports below 1 mb/d, a reduction of roughly 20 percent from current levels, but a far cry from ""zero."" Higher oil prices are constraining the Trump team. ""He has made it very clear that we need to have a campaign of maximum economic pressure ... but he also doesn't want to shock oil markets, he wants to ensure a well-supplied and stable oil market,"" Hook said, referring to Trump.

OPEC warns shale drillers. Earlier this week, a group of top OPEC officials warned U.S. shale executives in a meeting on the sidelines of the IHS CERAWeek Conference in Houston that the NOPEC legislation working its way through the U.S. Congress could result in much higher levels of production from OPEC, which would crash prices. They made clear that without the ability to coordinate, they would produce at maximum levels.

Libya clash feared. Although Libya's oil production is at multi-year highs and could rise even further, the division of the country between two governments could lead to a conflagration. The Libyan National Army (LNA) has piled up multiple victories on the battlefield, and analysts now fear it could turn its sights on the capital in Tripoli, where the internationally recognized government lacks the military might to fend off an invasion.

Investors to shale: ""show me the money."" Investors continue to pressure the shale industry to demonstrate profits. Shareholders' expectation ""a couple years ago was 'drill, baby, drill,'"" John Hess, CEO of Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC at the CERAWeek conference. ""Now it's 'show me the money.'"" But spending cuts could translate into much lower production growth, he said.

Offshore decline rates top 10 percent. Decline rates at offshore oil fields worldwide grew significantly beginning in 2016 due to lower infill activity. Last year, decline rates reached nearly 10 percent, almost double the rate from 2015, according to Rystad Energy.

Canadian oil sands could slow on pipeline delays. MEG Energy Corp. (TSE: MEG) and Imperial Oil (TSE: IMO) are reconsidering expansions of oil sands projects in Canada due to the inability for the region to build a new long distance pipeline, according to Bloomberg. MEG had planned to bring an expansion online later this year, but the most recent delay of the Line 3 pipeline means that the ""probability of that going ahead this year has decreased,"" MEG said. ""We don't want to be building capacity into a system where we don't have the ability to move it,"" MEG's CEO Derek Evans said in a conference call last week.

Exxon targets $15 breakevens for Permian. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) plans on cutting the cost of production in the Permian to just $15 per barrel, putting it on par with some of the lowest cost oil fields in the world. The President of XTO Energy, a subsidiary of Exxon, said that the oil major's scale could allow it to cut costs that low. He also said that the Permian's total production, currently at 4 mb/d, could double by 2025. Exxon will deploy 55 rigs in the Permian this year, more than any other company.

Unrest in Algeria threatens more disruptions. No oil and gas production has been affected yet, but political unrest in Algeria has raised the risk of more outages at a time when the oil market is already reeling from disruptions.

11402487,2019-12-19,"Libya's General Haftar is closing in on Tripoli, which in turn is prompting a sudden uptick in Turkish activity on behalf of the Tripoli-based government, and this next phase of war for ultimate control over the country's oil will be even messier.

It's been a stalemate for some time now, with Haftar consistently pushed back and kept from making any significant gains in breaching the Libyan capital.

But the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) is probably fighting a losing battle because the only foreign friend willing to come to its aid militarily is Turkey, while a lineup of external forces (Egypt, UAE, Russia and in a less tangible way, France) are aiding Haftar, who controls the oil, even if he does not control the oil revenues.

The forces that do come to the GNA's support are militias, and that's where it gets messy. No one outside of Turkey wants to be seen helping these militias, even if they ultimately support the UN-backed government. That support has soured because it's a tainted business, and everyone is aware that the GNA is entirely beholden to these militias.

The problem for Haftar is that taking Tripoli will require two steps: First, it will require air strikes on the capital city, and in that respect, Haftar has the advantage because he's got significant air strike capabilities thanks to external contributions to his war effort. Second, it will require boots on the ground for a final battle, and that means taking on the militias on the streets. This is where Haftar is at a disadvantage. He doesn't have enough troops who want to do battle on the streets of Tripoli against militia forces. This puts into question Haftar's ability to take full control of the capital, but if he gains enough control through airstrikes, militias are always for sale to the highest bidder.

All the indications are there for a new phase in this conflict, and the proof is in these four oil and military developments:

#1 GNA's Failed Oilfield Takeover Attempt

In the last week of November, GNA forces tried to take over the eastern El Feel oilfield - and failed.

The GNA managed to briefly wrest control of the oilfield from Haftar, who retook it later the same day with airstrikes right outside the compound. Shortly after production resumed at the field, it was shut down again over a valve closure on an export pipeline, taking 73,000 bpd offline and out of the market. With Haftar back in control, the valve closure was not coming from eastern forces and was likely a retaliation from GNA-backed forces.

Last week, Libya declared force majeure on the field over the valve closure, but a day later, production had been restored.

Turkey signed an agreement last week with the GNA on Mediterranean Sea maritime boundaries, killing two birds with one stone: It strengthens Turkey's leverage with the GNA and secures it a foothold in Libya (assuming that the GNA continues to hold Tripoli) and it is meant to serve as a bulwark in Libya's fight with Cyprus over offshore oil and gas exploration.

This deal is sparking a backlash from Greece and Egypt - all of whom say it is illegal, despite the fact that no one's actually seen where Libya and Turkey are putting this boundary. Greece expelled the Libyan ambassador to Athens over the incident.

The agreement went into effect last week.

The point of it all is to send a message about Libya, and about oil and gas exploration in Cyprus, too: No one is doing anything major in this region without going through Turkey first. Turkey needs more leverage, in other words, and it's using Libya as leverage.

Turkey is nervous about Haftar's potential; hence the sudden uptick in Turkish-related activity in Libya.

In the meantime, though, this is a geopolitical oil war that covers the entire region and sucks in Greece, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt - all of whom have oil and gas interests in these waters.

#3 Turkish Promise of More Military Support

Turkey has also signed a new defense agreement with the GNA for undefined military and logistical support - an offer that the GNA has accepted as Haftar readies for a new push on Tripoli.

But whether Turkish boots on the ground will be a part of this deal remains unclear; anonymous Turkish officials are saying it's unlikely. Turkey wants leverage here, not a street battle that could pit it against LNA soldiers and approximately 600-800 Russian mercenaries that the GNA claims are on the ground supporting Haftar in this conflict.

By late Wednesday, Haftar's forces were claiming to have cordoned off GNA forces around Tripoli, but there was no confirmation of this on the ground.

#4 All of a Sudden Oil Deals Are Popping Up

It's no coincidence that a string of oil deals come at the same time as General Haftar announces a new push on Tripoli.

Last week, Libya's NOC approved French Total SA's acquisition of Marathon Oil's assets in the country. These assets are worth $450 million and include a minority stake in the Waha concessions, with Total committing to invest an additional $650 million and boost capacity by 180,000 bpd.

While the French largely have pursued a double policy on Libya - paying lip-service to the internationally recognized GNA, but quietly supporting Haftar - the French would prefer to work with the General and are hedging their bets that he'll come out on top and be good for Libyan oil.

Also last week, the NOC signed two exploration and production-sharing agreements with Germany's Wintershall in the Sirte Basin, which also comes along with a $150-million corporate social responsibility commitment on the part of Wintershall.

Bottom line?

The 'final' push is being prepared, and big oil is betting on Haftar. The question at this point isn't really whether Haftar can take Tripoli - his air strike capabilities could destroy the capital city if he should choose. The question is whether he can take it and then actually control it effectively if he finds himself faced with a ground response once inside from various GNA-supporting militias with possible Turkish military and logistical support. The other question is this: If Haftar fails, will it just be another long-running stalemate inside Tripoli, or will it be a GNA victory that turns into a militia victory over which the GNA has absolutely no control? Either way, Haftar will still control the oil.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Greece', 'France', 'Egypt', 'Cyprus', 'Russia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Athens', 'Israel', 'Sirte', 'Germany']",The War For Ultimate Control Over Libya's Oil | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-War-For-Ultimate-Control-Over-Libyas-Oil.html,None,
11402488,2019-12-10,"The National Oil Corporation of Libya has announced that Russia's Tatneft has returned to its exploration project in the North African country, in the Northwest.

""We are very pleased with Tatneft's resumption of its activities at Ghadames Basin. This enhances confidence in Libya's oil and gas sector and serves the Libyan economy,"" NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement as quoted by Reuters.

Tatneft stopped its exploration activities in the Hamada area back in 2014 amid the Libyan civil war. Now, it is returning along with other oil companies that had pulled out of Libya during the height of the war.

In October, NOC said several Egyptian companies had also returned to Libya to help Libya's NOC to boost oil production by resuming previously suspended projects and expanding the country's pipeline network, both for oil and gas.

Two supermajors, BP and Eni, had also announced plans to resume their operations in Libya in 2018. BP has 85 percent in an offshore oil and gas block in the North African country, and earlier this year the Italian major struck a deal with BP to buy half of it. ""I'm not sure about this year since it takes time to set up offshore rigs but Q1 for sure,"" BP's former CEO Bob Dudley said in October 2018.

The return plans, however, had to be postponed due to the deteriorating security situation in Libya this year. In addition to the continued threat of field outages due to pipeline and export terminal blockades, this year saw the offensive of eastern Libya-affiliated and U.S.-backed Khalifa Haftar on Tripoli in a bid to take over the control of the country from the UN-recognized Government of National Accord.

The situation remains unstable. Just this week another production outage was declared for the El Feel oil field. The outage resulted from the closure of a valve on the pipeline feeding oil from El Feel to the Mellitah export terminal.

11402489,2019-10-29,"Irina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry.

Egyptian oil companies that had operations in Libya but pulled out during the civil war will return to the country, the National Oil Corporation said.

NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the Egyptian companies will help Libya's NOC to boost oil production by resuming previously suspended projects and will also take part in expanding the country's pipeline network, both for oil and gas.

Earlier this month, Sanalla warned that Libya's oil production could drop steeply soon unless the Government of National Accord - the UN-recognized Libyan government - released funds meant for the National Oil Corporation.

""If the corporation's allocations are not released without delay, Libyan oil production will be hundreds of thousands of barrels per day lower than it should be. That will have an extremely negative effect on national income,"" Sanalla said at the time.

A few days later, however, the GNA released the funds due NOC in yet another demonstration of the vital importance of the country's oil industry for most of its revenues.

To date, NOC produces some 1.3 million barrels of oil daily, but last year Sanalla said that the company was eyeing a return to pre-war levels of 1.6 million bpd by the end of 2019. This may not happen by the end of the year, but if more foreign companies return to the North African country, production may continue to grow.

Of course, the danger of outages remains as the political situation remains unstable. Over the last few years as various groups fought for control of Libya's oil wealth, outages became more or less a regularity, especially at the largest field, El Sharara, which produces about 300,000 bpd of crude.

11402490,2019-10-02,"Even with dissident Iranian sources providing a form of confirmation that the Iranian leadership ordered the September 14th attack on Saudi oil facilities, there will be no war. The Saudi Crown Prince, MBS, has made that clear, calling for a political solution. A war, after all, would preclude an Aramco IPO that is now in full force, with the latest enticement to potentially skeptical investors being the oil giant's promise to pay out a total annual dividend of $75 billion--up from the some $58 billion that Aramco paid the Saudi government in dividends last year. Riyadh has also moved to re-risk a bit over Aramco's royalty payments, lowering royalties when oil falls below $70, but increasing royalties when oil is above that mark.

The dividend pledge comes after some more bad news for the Kingdom with Fitch's downgrade of Saudi Arabia's sovereign credit grade from A+ to A on fears it could be drawn into a deeper conflict, either with Iran or with its own allies.

The Saudi Crown Prince took to the airwaves this week to warn the world that if Iran isn't deterred (preferably through a political, not military, solution) oil supplies will be further disrupted and oil prices will be ""unimaginably high"".

That said, oil prices at this point aren't even responding to Iran--they're responding to macro-economic data, and particularly to demand fears over the US-China trade war. Those fears have been further exacerbated by sources in Washington who claim that Trump is considering delisting Chinese companies from US stock exchanges, which would further destabilize international markets.

In the meantime, look for more talk of political solutions even in the face of intensifying Iranian bravado as MBS attempts to watch this all go away and convince investors that security issues were a blip on the radar. The next big event: An October fest of sorts in which the Saudis host a bunch of billionaires that they will fly in to Riyadh and then transport on yachts to talk about investing in tourism.

Ukraine: It's About Oil & Gas

Ukraine wants independence from Russian gas, but there's something it wants even more: American military support. But they also need gas transit fees from transporting Russian gas through Ukrainian territory to European markets. It was never really about independence from Russian gas--it was about money from Russian gas. And that is now being cut off, leaving American military aid as the carrot that convinces Kiev to stay the course on the Russians.

Russia is already putting the squeeze on Ukraine, and Kiev is prepared for a scenario in which Gazprom completely turns off the transport spigot, leaving Ukraine with zero transport fees as of January 2020. The only Ukraine benefits from this policy is getting American military support. (The potentially transactional nature of the flaunting of this support in a quid pro quo for an investigation into the Biden family's connections to a Ukrainian energy company is the crux of the ongoing impeachment proceedings).

Why does Ukraine think Russia will turn off the spigots in January? Because it can. Even though some one-third of Russian gas headed to Europe currently passes through Ukraine, the existing agreement is set to expire at the end of the year, and by most accounts, Russia can still meet its gas commitments, even if the Nord Stream pipeline isn't up and running by then.

Russian Fallout from US China Shipper Sanctions

When the US sanctioned Chinese shipping company COSCO last week, the fallout was felt well beyond its intended victims. US-listed Teekay LNG has seen its Russian JV blocked due to complicated association. COSCO Dalian is 50% owner of China LNG Shipping, which is in turn a partner with Teekay's 50-50 Yamal LNG JV. Novatek's Yamal LNG plant in northern Russia could suffer as a result because it uses the Teekay JV's LNG tankers that are capable of going through Arctic ice.

And this isn't the only fallout: Shipping is getting exorbitantly expensive. Following the new sanctions, oil freight rates jumped because buyers were trying to get alternative vessels, pushing up the rates of those not sanctioned by as much as 50% immediately after the sanctions, and another ~10% since, though part of that can be attributed to the normal uptick in winter demand.

All Aboard the OPEC Train

OPEC's Secretary General Barkindo has invited 97 oil-producing countries in the world to join the production cuts that the OPEC/non-OPEC alliance has cooked up to keep prices high. Of course, Barkindo uses more palatable words such as ""manage the oil supply"" or ""oil market stability"" to describe its production cut plans.

The call to get more countries on board is a clear indication of the waning clout of the oil cartel, with founding member Venezuela having almost zero control over its oil exports and Iran in essentially the same boat. Saudi Arabia -- the heavyweight in OPEC -- has done more than its fair share of production cutting and export cutting to arrest bloated global oil inventories, but it is not enough. OPEC now only controls 35% of the oil market, and even with the overzealous production cutters in the group, it is insufficient to move the oil-price needle. And if Saudi oil installations were attacked in scale again, there is nothing OPEC could do to cover lost supply.

Realizing its insufficiency, OPEC has called on Russia and a handful of others, including Mexico, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Oman, Sudan, South Sudan, and Kazakhstan -- to join the cause. While this brought the cutters to controlling 55% of the global oil market, it still isn't enough, and nothing highlighted this more than when Saudi Arabia dropped its production by another 5.7 million bpd after the attacks on its oil infrastructure on Sept 14. Prices spiked for a very short while, before Saudi Arabia raced to bring back its production. But prices fell shortly thereafter, highlighting OPEC and its allies' impotence when pitted against the US/China trade war that has soured the oil demand outlook and depressed prices.

OPEC has few moves left, and recruiting additional unofficial members are its only hope. While most of the 97 oil producers are unlikely to join, including some of the world's largest producers such as the United States, Canada, and China, even one or two additional joiners could give OPEC a boost in managing the oil glut.

Keep An Eye on the Guyana-Suriname Basin Right Now

But don't look at the obvious, endless string of discoveries by Exxon/Hess. Look now at what's happening right on the other side of the maritime border in Suriname, where Apache's drillship has officially started drilling, and first results could be in a matter of 2-3 weeks.

Jumping back to the Guyana side, much-awaited elections now won't be held until March 2020, timed to coincide with Exxon's first production from giant Liza. Tensions are bound to rise with the country's first-ever oil revenues at stake.

Turkey Ups the Ante Offshore Cyprus

A Turkish drillship is scheduled to start drilling at a second location offshore Cyprus in a matter of days, according to Turkey's Energy Ministry. But what was intended to be a major threat to Cypriot offshore drilling is actually a Turkish drillship withdrawing from Cypriot waters earlier this month and relocating after apparently coming up empty-handed.

Global Oil & Gas Playbook

* Iran has announced plans to create a new oil terminal on the Sea of Oman to establish an alternative crude export route that would bypass the Strait of Hormuz. According to the Iranian Oil Ministry, the country's national oil company has already signed a contract worth around $52 million with three domestic companies to supply 50 pumps for a 620-mile pipeline that will run from Bushehr province to Bandar-e-Jask on the Sea of Oman. The government expects that the terminal will export its first crude within 18 months.

* Occidental Petroleum has closed on the sale of its Mozambique LNG project for $3.9 billion to the French energy major Total. The sale is part of Occidental Petroleum's ongoing divestiture goal after buying Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion. To help finance it, Oxy previously agreed to sell Anadarko's Africa assets to Total for $8.8 billion, which includes the Mozambique LNG export project. In the August agreement between Occidental and Total, companies are working on closing the remaining transactions in Algeria, Ghana and South Africa.

* Sempra Energy will sell its Peruvian businesses to a unit of China Yangtze Power Co for $3.59 billion as part of Sempra's plan to exit South America and focus on its domestic and Mexican market. The assets up for divestment include an 83.6% stake in Luz del Sur, as well as interests in energy services firms Tecsur SA and Inland Energy SAC. The two companies also entered into an MoU for potential LNG cooperation, which could see Sempra supplying China. For Q4, Sempra Energy is also planning to put its electric businesses in Chile up for sale.

* Fracking company Cuadrilla is officially moving out of the Preston New Road shale project in Lancashire, UK. Equipment is now being moved from the site and the company has said it has no plans to apply to extend the operating license. The project was suspended indefinitely on August 26th when its operations were said to have caused a 2.9-magnitude earthquake.

* The US sanctions on Venezuela and Russia have been unable to stop payments that Venezuela must make to Moscow to make good on its debt. Venezuela is now making payments to Russia in rubles to not run afoul with sanctions. Venezuela's sanctions on its central bank have stymied its way of paying any debt in US dollars, and its ability to pay creditors with oil have also dried up, as shippers are reluctant to transport Venezuela's oil due to the sanctions.

* The Brazilian government says that more than a dozen companies have registered for the November auction of drilling rights off the coast, including Chevron, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Brazil expects to raise as much as $25 billion. The so-called transfer-of-rights auction concerns a zone of Brazil's southeastern coast where state-controlled Petrobras obtained rights to 5 billion barrels of oil from the government in 2010. The company found more crude than it was entitled to in the deal, leaving the government with a surplus to auction off.

* Indonesia and Libya's NOC have discussed the possibility of Pertamina returning to Libya to participate in oil projects. Indonesia's interest in Libya coincides with talk of German Wintershall DEA's potential exit after a clash with NOC over oil licenses.

* Ecuador plans to leave OPEC as its government attempts to boost its revenue. While it only produces around 530,000 barrels of crude per day--and hasn't been adhering to the production quotas set by OPEC anyway--the breaking away of Ecuador strips more clout away from OPEC.

* The Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) operating consortium says natural gas flows from Azerbaijan to Europe are now on track for commercial flows to start in October 2020. After that, the pipeline is expected to reach its full commercial capacity within 2-3 years, transporting 16 billion cubic meters of gas per year. Annual revenue at full capacity is expected to be around $1.45 billion.

* Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund has the green light to sell oil and gas stocks worth $5.9 billion, even though two years ago it sought to sell about $40 billion in such stocks. The fund holds 95 oil-producing companies, making up 0.8% of its benchmark for equities and including ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources Inc., Occidental Petroleum, and CNOOC. The initial $40 billion plan was reduced in a political compromise that shielded the world's biggest oil companies. According to the country's Finance Ministry, the fund will maintain stakes in refiners and other downstream firms.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Riyadh', 'United States', 'Ukraine', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Iran', 'China', 'Kiev', 'Turkey', 'Cyprus', 'Washington (state)', 'Dalian', 'Venezuela', 'Mexico', 'Moscow']",The War That Won't Happen & The War That Already Is | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-War-That-Wont-Happen-The-War-That-Already-Is.html,None,
11402491,2019-09-23,"The U.S, the UK, France, Italy, Germany and the UAE have issued a joint statement in recognition of the National Oil Corporation of Libya as ""the country's sole independent, legitimate and nonpartisan oil company,"" the Libya Herald reports.

Reuters adds that Turkey also signed the statement.

""For the sake of Libya's political and economic stability, and the well-being of all its citizens, we exclusively support the NOC and its crucial role on behalf of all Libyans,"" the signatories of the statement also said.

The statement comes in response to the formation of an alternative board of directors at a subsidiary of NOC, the Brega Petroleum Marketing Company in the east of the country, which is under the control of the so-called eastern government -- a body not recognized by the UN.

Interestingly enough, the signatories of the statement in support of NOC do not all support the UN-recognized government. The UAE backs the Libyan National Army led by General Khalifa Haftar, who is affiliated with the eastern government, while the rest are backers of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord.

With Libya still divided and the LNA continuing its offensive against Tripoli in a bid to further its control in the war-torn country, NOC called the formation of the new board of directors of Brega an attempt to divide the company and, as a consequence, Libya.

Brega, for its part, has accused NOC of curbing fuel supplies to the eastern parts of Libya as the reason for the breakup. NOC has defended its fuel supplies to the east as ""more than adequate for civilian purposes"". The state company also added that the ""real motive behind this attempt is to set up a new illegitimate entity for the illegal export of oil from Libya.""

BPMC, which is based in eastern Libya, has seen some board members break away and accuse parent company NOC of deliberately cutting jet fuel and kerosene supply to the eastern part of the country, controlled by eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar.

Sources in Libya told S&P Global Platts on Thursday that a break-away parallel firm could create a dangerous precedent of a company in the east trying to market fuel independently from NOC, which is the only legitimate exporter and importer of fuel and crude oil.

""NOC rejects any attempts to partition and politicize Libya's oil sector to serve narrow interests and foreign agendas. Fuel supply to the Eastern and Central regions is more than adequate for civilian purposes. The real motive behind this attempt is to set up a new illegitimate entity for the illegal export of oil from Libya,"" NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement on Thursday.

""Let us be clear, if NOC loses its oil export monopoly, the future integrity of Libya is at grave risk,"" Sanalla noted.

""NOC is exploring all legal and diplomatic measures, and puts all companies operating on the oil market on notice that any attempt to deal or sign contracts with this false company is a clear violation of Security Council resolutions,"" the state oil firm's chairman said.

A serious internal conflict within Libya's already fractured oil sector could, once again, result in volatile oil production levels from one of the wildest cards in the oil market in the past half-decade.

The security situation in Libya has worsened since the spring after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that has escalated and disrupted, once again, Libya's oil production and exports.

Two outages at the biggest oil field Sharara in one month forced Libya's oil production down to below 1 million bpd in the first week of August -- the lowest level in five months and a sign of Libya's wild card status in terms of production consistency. The outage at Sharara resulted in Libya's average crude oil production declining by 21,000 bpd month on month in August, to 1.056 million bpd from 1.078 million bpd in July, according to OPEC's secondary sources.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Brega', 'Tripoli']",Is Libya Facing A New Oil Crisis? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Is-Libya-Facing-A-New-Oil-Crisis.html,None,

Haftar-affiliated forces, with a convoy of 75 military vehicles, arrived at the Sharara oil field on Monday, The Libya Observer reported, quoting a military source as telling local media outlets.

According to The Libya Observer, the forces loyal to Haftar are concerned that a rival army, the South Protection Force of the government of national accord, could kick the eastern-affiliated forces out of oil fields.

The security situation in Libya has materially worsened since the spring after Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli.

The move was meant to send a message, but it is unclear that message has been received. The panic now is that Trump could target China's state-run CNPC with sanctions because it has, according to tanker data, recently deployed a new fleet to transport oil from Iran through one of its subsidiaries. If Washington moves to sanction CNPC that would indicate a major escalation of this conflict. At the same time, panic is being further spread with Bank of America Merrill Lynch's theory that China could potentially decide to defy the latest U.S. tariff threat by ramping up imports of Iranian crude, which could cause prices to plunge by as much as $20-$30.

- Libya's NOC says it will gradually restart production at its largest oilfield, El Sharara. The oilfield was shut down after a valve on the pipeline linking it to the Zawiya oil terminal was closed Tuesday last week. A local armed group had earlier prevented NOC staff from reopening the valve. Libya's production fell to its lowest in five months over this force majeure. Production had fallen below 1 million bpd. Force majeure has not yet been lifted. Force majeure was also declared on the Zawiya terminal on July 20 and then lifted on July 22nd.

- Alberta reports that its oil inventories are now at near two-year lows, following the institution of production quotas last December as WCS oil prices slid and at one point were trading at a $50 discount to WTI. Production quotas have since been eased; however, other problems remain: To wit: higher WCS prices rendered oil shipments by rail economically unfeasible, and Alberta lacks any spare pipeline capacity to get oil to market.

Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions

- Saudi Crown Prince MBS is still gunning for a $2-trillion valuation of Aramco, despite falling oil prices, but bankers and advisors are looking to trim that valuation to $1.5 trillion at best. A board meeting today was to address this issue and we will have sources close to that reporting back in the coming days. What has come out of that board meeting rumor mill is that the IPO is likely to go forward as early as next year. But what should make investors cringe is that MBS is really raising funds here for his outsized futuristic city in the desert, NEOM, with this IPO. In the meantime, Aramco's oil exports will remain flat through September at fewer than 7 million bpd. September will see Aramco produce 700,000 fewer bpd than August as Saudi Arabia attempts to reduce global inventories amid US-China trade war and an economic slowdown, particularly in Europe.

- Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has taken a significant position in Permian crude operator Oryx Midstream Services for $550 million. Qatar, through QIA, is seeking to boost investment in the US to $45 billion in the coming years.

- UAE's Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) will invest in global storage terminal owner and operator VTTI, which owns and operates storage terminals in a dozen countries in Europe, Asia and Africa with some 60 million barrels of storage capacity. Adnoc will acquire a 10% stake in VTTI with IFM Investors. Vitol will retain 45% ownership.

- Occidental (OXY) has closed on its $55-billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum (plus assumption of Anadarko debt). OXY sold $13 billion in debt to finance the acquisition. At the same time, OXY and Colombian Ecopetrol have entered into a $1.5-billion JV deal to develop assets in the Permian Midland Basin. Ecopetrol will pay $750 million cash plus $750 million of carried capital in exchange for a 49% interest in the JV. The JV deal comes as Occidental acquires Anadarko Petroleum.

- China's state-run oil company CNOOC will acquire a majority stake in key West African offshore oil drilling licenses. The deal will give the Chinese giant a 55.6% stake in the Sinapa and Esperanca licenses in Guinea Bissau from Swedish firm Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB. Svenka's stake will be reduced to 23.03%. If a commercial discovery is made, CNOOC's stake will drop to 50%.

Politics, Geopolitics & Conflict

- Belarus state energy company Belneftekhim has agreed with Russia to raise the oil transit tariff by 3.7% starting from September 1st. The deal is a form of compensation for a decline in flows due to contamination of Russian oil earlier this year - an incident that saw some countries temporarily halt crude imports from Russia over quality concerns. Those temporary halts cost Belarus transit revenues.

- Turkish authorities are sending a third drillship into Mediterranean waters in Cyprus' EEZ, further intensifying the dispute over offshore oil. The Turks already have three vessels in the area - two drillships and one exploration vessel. Turkey's drilling operations in Cypriot waters continue despite warnings from the European Union and the U.S. Last month, EU foreign ministers suspended negotiations on a comprehensive air transport agreement and decided not to hold further EU-Turkey integration dialogue for the time being.

- Kyrgyzstan's ex-president Almazbek Atambaev was detained on Thursday, a day after a raid on his home led to a shootout in which one security officer died and some 80 others were injured. The detention prompted a clash between the supporters of the ex-president and police. Atambaev had repeatedly refused to show up in court to testify about corruption and abuse of office charges.

- The US Maritime Administration issued a warning that Iran is using GPS jammers to try and trick commercial vessels into traveling through Iranian waters where they would be seized. This has not been independently confirmed. Federal officials said that during at least two recent encounters, including the detention of the British and Liberian flagged ships involving Iranian military forces, vessels reported GPS interference. Security companies that operate in the Gulf are now replacing guards who are UK nationals on their vessels with guards from other countries. The security firms are recommending other vessels in the area replace their UK guards as well.

Russian Rosneft is now officially the last major supplier of petrol to Venezuela.

Regulations & Legislation

- EU antitrust regulators are targeting Polish oil refiner PKN Orlen over its bid for rival Lotos. Regulators say the deal might lead to a spike in prices and a reduction in competition in the supply of fuels and related markets. The deal, agreed last year, will see PKN Orlen take a majority 53% stake in state-owned Lotos. PKN Orlen operates 2,679 petrol stations in Poland and across Central and Eastern Europe. Lotos operates some 500 petrol stations in Poland. The European Commission has opened a full-scale investigation into the agreement, with a final decision expected by December.

- Russian oligarch Arkady Rotenberg, a former judo training partner of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has denied a Bloomberg report that he had bought a stake in Russian gas giant Gazprom. Last month, Gazprom sold a quasi-treasury stake of 2.93% worth $2.1 billion and half of that offering went to an undisclosed investor. Rotenberg and his brother Boris are both sanctioned by the U.S, and their assets were frozen in 2014 over close ties to Putin.

- Shale firm Halcon Resources has filed for a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy with plans to hand over ownership of the company to its debt holders. Under the prepackaged plan of reorganization, Halcon would eliminate more than $750M in debt and reduce annual interest expense by more than $40M. Halcon already went through a bankruptcy restructuring in 2016.

Earnings Beat

Despite all, some strong earnings calls this week:

- Exxon's Q2 2019 earnings beat expectations with a ramp-up in liquid volumes in the Permian, though this was partially offset by scheduled downtime activities. Earnings came in at 73 cents per share, beating analyst estimates (Zacks) of 68 cents. Total production was higher than a year ago, at 3.909 MMBOE/d, up from 3.647 MMBOE/d. Liquid production was up to 2.389 MMB/D, from 2.212 MMB/D a year ago. Cash flow was nearly $6 billion from operations and asset divestments, down from $8.1 billion a year ago. Capital and exploration spending rose 22% to $8.1 billion.

- Marathon Oil saw a huge uptick in quarterly profits--50% for the second quarter, largely on the back of increased US shale production. Its Q2 production in the US rose 11.4% to 332,000 boepd. The higher production figures offset the lower prices that were seen in the quarter. Revenues were $1.43 billion for the quarter.

- Murphy Oil also beat estimates, with Q2 earnings of $0.21/share. Zacks estimate was $0.18/share. A year ago, earnings were $0.36/share. That's two quarterly earnings surprises for Murphy in a row.

Production was resumed and the force majeure lifted on July 22, but yet another pipeline valve was closed on July 31, triggering another force majeure.

11402496,2019-08-01,"Libya's oil production plunged to a five-month low this week, dragged down by another outage at the country's largest oil field.

On July 30, Libya's National Oil Corporation declared force majeure on crude loadings at the Zawiya port, due to another ""valve closure halting crude oil supply"" from the Sharara oil field to the port. It's the second outage at the field in ten days.

The NOC said that staff from its subsidiary, Akakus Oil Corporation, ""attempted to reopen the valve but were prevented from doing so by a local armed group.""

As a result of the outage, Libya's oil production fell to a five-month low of 950,000 bpd, according to Bloomberg. Prior to the disruption, Libya had succeeded in raising output to 1.3 million barrels per day (mb/d), the highest level in six years.

""This latest incident only serves to highlight the fragility of our security environment and total disregard for the impact of such acts on the lives of everyday Libyans,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement. ""The loss of production at Libya's largest oilfield severely disrupts power supply to the grid and continued funding of basic services. This is most acutely felt by communities in the South.""

The four-month assault on Tripoli by the Libyan National Army (LNA) has stalled, but until recently, Libya's oil production had largely held up. The two outages at the Sharara field could be an indication of a deteriorating security situation.

As the LNA's assault against the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli has dragged on, the militia led by Khalifa Haftar has become stretched thin. ""This has sucked in the LNA's resources from elsewhere in Libya, weakening its already loose hold over territory nominally under its control, particularly in the centre and south west of the country,"" Hamish Kinnear of Verisk Maplecroft wrote in a July 22 briefing, shortly after the Sharara field suffered its first outage. ""This means that the group will become increasingly unable to prevent disruptive sabotage attacks"" of this kind.

Others agree. With the LNA and GNA bogged down in the fight for Tripoli, there is a ""nationwide security vacuum,"" Iliasse Sdiqui, senior analyst at Whispering Bell, a risk management firm, told Oilprice.com in an email. That has led to the possibility that local groups, often driven by their own local grievances, are increasingly able disrupt oil operations.

For now, it's possible that the outage could be brief. Libya's NOC said that ""[n]egotiations are ongoing in an effort to restart production as soon as possible.""

However, the ""more acute threat stems from the possibility a warring faction in the current conflict will resort to halting crude flows, either directly or indirectly, as a political card,"" Sdiqui of Whispering Bell said. ""So far, there is evidence that factions are exercising restraint and being cautious as nobody wants to be the first one accused of disrupting the backbone of the country's economy.""

Libya earns about 95 percent of its total national revenue from oil so even a temporary outage is highly damaging. ""Ensuring the security of Libya's oil infrastructure should be of utmost priority to all stakeholders, regardless of affiliation, as the livelihoods of Libyans across the country depend on stable oil revenues,"" a spokesperson for the GNA told Oilprice.com in an email. ""There can be no stability in Libya without an urgent end to the violence. The Government of National Accord is thoroughly committed to achieving political stability and national reconciliation, and to establishing a timeline for democratic elections.""

But the outage at the Sharara field is a worrying sign that instability is growing worse, not better. Hamish Kinnear of Verisk Maplecroft notes that the LNA had gained some ""international legitimacy as a protector of Libya's oil and gas infrastructure"" over the past two years. But the LNA's assault on Tripoli was opposed by much of the international community because of the likelihood that it would destroy a fragile peace process - which it has. At the same time, the LNA's campaign has largely run aground amid stiff resistance from the GNA and GNA-aligned groups, and the fight has devolved into a protracted civil war.

Oil supply outages would further damage the LNA's reputation. ""A failure to maintain security for oil and gas infrastructure would damage the LNA's legitimacy and invite increasing scrutiny from international powers, particularly a US administration concerned with maintaining the security of oil supplies and low prices,"" Kinnear of Verisk Maplecroft concluded.

11402497,2019-08-01,"The Chinese oil and gas sector is now officially open for foreign participation without a requirement to form joint ventures with local companies, but while Chinese media quote oil majors as praising the move, experts say that China needs additional regulatory reforms in order to attract foreign investment.

A month ago, China said that it would remove the joint venture requirement for foreign companies wanting to enter its oil and gas industry as it moves to open up a range of industries as per a pledge it made during its continuing trade dispute with the United States.

The Chinese National Development and Reform Commission announced it would remove the joint venture requirement for oil and gas projects along with a rule stating that only local firms can control gas networks in cities with populations of over half a million people.

The new regulatory measures took effect this week, on July 30, opening the upstream oil and gas market in China to foreign firms in a bid to attract overseas capital and advance the ongoing energy reforms, China's news agency Xinhua says.

Foreign participation will boost China's oil and gas production, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Centre for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told Xinhua, adding that major international oil firms could speed up the country's exploration of unconventional oil and gas resources.

Shortly after China announced the scrapping of the joint venture requirement, China Daily quoted the local managers of majors BP and Shell as saying that they were encouraged by the Chinese market reforms.

Earlier this year, BP was set to become the latest international major to quit drilling for shale gas in China because of poor exploration drilling results so far. Shell, for its part, ventured into the shale oil business by signing an agreement with Sinopec to jointly study the potential development of shale oil in eastern China.

While Chinese media quote Shell and BP praising the opening of the upstream sector to foreign investment, law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP -- licensed to operate as a foreign law firm in China -- said in comments about the reforms that ""in order to provide foreign investors with access to more opportunities in a fairer and more transparent business environment, additional regulatory changes are to be in place to implement the new regime, and let the market identify and evolve with opportunities in practice.""",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['China', 'United States', 'Libya']","China Is Now Officially Open For Foreign Oil, Gas Exploration | OilPrice.com",https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Is-Now-Officially-Open-For-Foreign-Oil-Gas-Exploration.html,None,

Libya NOC representatives traveled to China today to discuss China's interest in helping to restore Libya's oil industry that has suffered through years of civil unrest, according to the Libya Observer.

While there, the Libyan delegation met with CNPC and other companies to discuss ""cooperation in Libyan exploration and development, oilfield services, and trading of Libyan crude, with parties potentially cementing future relations through the signature of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at their next meeting,"" NOC's statement read.

""With a more stable security environment, we could easily add between 300-400,000 barrels to daily production and grow oil revenue receipts. Our long-term strategy is to produce 2.1 million bpd by 2023. China can help us on that journey,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanallah said.

That ""more stable security environment"" has proved rather elusive for Libya, with unrest disrupting oil production and exports on a semi-regular basis. The last such disruption resulted in a force majeure after an unidentified group closed a pipeline valve that halted production in the El Sharara oilfield. The disruption cascaded into the Port of Az Zawiyah, which was closed.

Libya managed in Q2 to increase its oil production over Q1, but lower oil prices in 2019 hurt Libya's oil revenues, which for the first six months of 2019 lagged H1 2018 by 11.2 percent, coming in at $10.2 billion. This revenue is critical to Libya, relying on oil almost completely for its revenue. In H1, 92.8 percent of Libya's total income was from oil.

Continued lower prices and further production disruptions, particularly of Libya's largest oilfield, may seek to dissuade foreign investments into its oil industry, even eager ones such as China.

11402499,2019-07-24,"With tankers detained and drones shot down the geopolitical mess surrounding Iran does not look to be ending anytime soon. Iran's seizure of a UK-owned chemical tanker and the brief detainment of a crude-laden VLCC, coupled with the sudden shutdown of the Sharara field in Libya, sent crude prices upwards early this week. Risks of a more serious conflict rose even higher when the US Central Command reported that a second Iranian drone had been shot down over the Strait of Hormuz and sanctioned the Chinese state-owned oil company Zhuhai Zhenrong for buying Iranian crude. The resumption of US-China trade talks offered some relief for markets, but bearish sentiment was cooled by a substantial US crude inventory drawdown.

As of Wednesday afternoon, global crude benchmark Brent traded within the $63.9-64.2 per barrel interval, whilst US benchmark WTI was assessed around $56.9-57.1 per barrel.

- West African crude trading has been under tangible pressure from US crude movements which supplant them from traditional hubs of demand.

- Whilst WAF grades generally trade for 2 months in advance, traders are still seeking to clear August-loading cargoes, both Angolan and Nigerian.

- For the moment the supply overhang is not yet reflected in the market's assessment of the crudes (even though the August OSP are already out) as the Nigerian crudes' tender season still did not close.

- If, however, the end of the tender season does not bring about any substantial change in assessment, sellers of Nigerian crude may face a panic sell-out of remaining July-loading cargoes.

- The relative inexpensiveness of US volumes has resulted in a surge of American exports to NW Europe, primarily into the United Kingdom, which accounted for 43 percent of all US exports to the Old Continent this July.

- US crude exports to Europe averaged 576kbpd so far in July 2019, with the United Kingdom taking in 248kbpd.

2. India Pushing Forward with Refining Capacity Expansion

- India's oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan claimed India will be on track to boost its total refining capacity by a further 4mbpd in the next 20 years, from today's level of 5mbpd.

- Indian refiners are widely known for their overutilization of nameplate capacities, April 2018 being the last month on track when the aggregate Indian refinery runs were lower than their nominal capacity (still at 98 percent though).

- Despite the anticipated rise of EVs on the Indian market, the oil ministry expects oil demand to reach 8.8mbpd by 2030, thus the 4mbpd refinery capacity expansion would only be enough to cover domestic needs.

- Pradhan also claimed that India's oil demand is assumed to attain 10.6mbpd by 2040, which would result in a 1.5mbpd worth of gap between domestic demand and refining capabilities.

- Given that India traditionally exports 20-25 percent of its oil products to adjacent South Asian countries, the required refining expansion ought to be even more ambitious if it does not want to lose its existing market outlets.

- Anticipated refinery capacity additions consist primarily of brownfield refinery upgrades, with only two greenfield ones - the 180kbpd Nagapattinam (Tamil Nadu) and the 180kbpd Barmer (Rajasthan) Refineries.

- The Nigerian national oil company NNPC has dropped the majority of its August-loading OSPs, reflecting weaker demand for light sweet WAF crudes in Europe.

- The prices of Nigerian flagship grades Qua Iboe and Brass River were decreased by 58 and 51 cents per barrel respectively, whilst Bonny Light and Forcados were down 41-47 cents per barrel.

- Simultaneously, NNPC has awarded 34 contracts for its 2019-2020 direct sale-direct purchase (DSDP) program under which it allocates a given amount of crude in return for oil products of equivalent value.

- Oil majors are compelled to team up with local Nigerian companies - Vitol, BP, Litasco, Total and CEPSA were all among the selected parties.

- The new head of NNPC Mallam Kyari was responsible for the DSDP program before he was promoted, ensuring continuity of top-level backing as Nigeria still struggles to run its refineries anywhere near their nameplate capacities.

- Nigerian crude exports have contracted a bit in July, down 6 percent month-on-month at 1.89mbpd (from June's 2.01mbpd export rate).

- Libya's NOC was forced to shut down the El Sharara oilfield over the weekend, due to a closed valve that was reportedly sealed by a group of vandals.

- By Sunday evening however NOC technicians were able to locate the shut valve and lift the state of force majeure, as introduuced on Saturday morning.

- Despite the force majeure lift, this week did not see a single El Sharara cargo loader in the port of Zawia, where volumes from both El Sharara and El Feel are transported for further exports.

- The incident raises fears that the Zintan Brigades might be looking into disrupting Sharara's infrastructure again, as the majority of Libya's oil segment is now under direct or indirect control of Field Marshal Haftar.

- In one of our April issues of Oil Insider we have raised the issue of Forties increasingly becoming the lynchpin BFOE crude for Asian buyers, a handy tool to keep the Brent-Dubai spread palatable depending on the conditions.

- In June-July 2019 Forties cargoes have gone exclusively to the Asia Pacific region, with both months witnessing 3 China-bound and 1 South Korean VLCC delivery.

- This Autumn might witness a further shift of Forties' exports, with South Korea becoming the hottest market outlet for the crude, buttressed by the recently concluded EU-South Korea free-trade deal.

- South Korea was a notable buyer of Forties in 2018, averaging a 80kbpd monthly import rate, however its purchases of the North Sea crude dropped to a mere 15kbpd in H1 2019.

- Chinese buyers have concurrently demonstrated an unusual interest for July and August-loading Murban cargoes from the UAE which might hamper their interest in purchasing Forties.

- Coming back from the supergiant oil field's first-ever maintenance period, Kashagan production is said to have reached its planned peak production rate of 370kbpd.

- The maintenance works included the redevelopment of the field's offshore gas injection complex which would allow NCOC, the operator, to go beyond the supposed first-phase peak and aim for a 450kbpd production plateau.

- Having started preliminatory work on Kashagan 2nd development phase, NCOC has concurrently expressed its interest in including the Khazar and Kalamkas-More fields into the Kashagan oil flows.

- Even though the shareholders do not expect a FID on the two adjacent fields before 2022, they believe the add-in might boost total output by a further 100kbpd.

- Creating synergies between the two projects is rendered more difficult by the different shareholder lineup - Khazar's development is allotted to a JV that sees Royal Dutch Shell, KazMunayGaz and Oman Oil split the shares (55, 25 and 20 percent), with Shell acting as operator.

7. Tacit Ghanaian Discontent on the Results of First-Ever Licensing Round

- Last week we reported on the Ghanaian authorities allotting the offshore Block 03 to the ENI-Vitol consortium, the second block to be offered in the African country's licensing round.

- As much a success as the consolidation of ENI's footing in Ghana is, the results of the offshore licensing round seem to be quite disappointing on balance.

- Several global oil and gas majors have withdrawn from the bidding process, amongst them BP, Total, ExxonMobil and a couple of others.

- Argus reported that the relevant companies complained about the quality of seismic data provided in the licensing round as well as repining against the relative small size of the offered blocks.

- The small block size adds a gives an edge to majors already present in Ghana (i.e. ENI's tie-in of Block 03 production to the Sankofa hub it operates) whilst deterring new companies.

- Block 02 is the only lot that was allocated so far apart from ENI-Vitol's Block 03, landing in the hands of largely marginal Nigerian and Ghanaian firms, FEPD and Elandel Energy.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Nigeria', 'Iran', 'India', 'Libya', 'United Kingdom', 'China', 'Zhuhai', 'Nagapattinam', 'Rajasthan', 'Tamil Nadu', 'South Korea', 'Angola']",Oil Markets Struggle For Certainty | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Markets-Struggle-For-Certainty.html,None,
11402500,2019-06-19,"Libya's Ras Lanuf Oil Terminal Is Now A Key Military Base for Haftar

For the second time in less than 45 days, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) of Libya in Tripoli has condemned the militarization of the country's energy infrastructure by General Haftar and his forces. Of particular concern is the military presence inside the Ras Lanuf oil terminal in central Libya. Our sources inside the NOC say that Haftar's forces have stormed this terminal and seized one building to house some 80 military officers. They have also attempted to provide a warship with fuel and have seized food stores and housing units for employees at the terminal.

With the NOC chairman, Mustafa Sanallah, calling this act a major threat to the country's oil infrastructure, he has also indicated that he may withdraw employees if he feels they are in danger. Withdrawing them would effectively hand the terminal over to Haftar without a fight.

That means that Haftar would completely control one of the largest terminals on the shores of the southern Mediterranean, with a storage capacity of 6.5 million barrels of oil.

In the meantime, we have witnessed the first attack on a foreign oil asset in this conflict, with a JV between Eni and the Libya NOC damaged in an air strike on Tuesday that wounded three workers. The airstrike, launched by Haftar's forces, damaged a storehouse belonging to the JV, Mellitah Oil & Gas. Equipment and warehouse materials were destroyed in the airstrike.

The warehouse was in the east Tripoli area of Tajoura and the airstrikes are in response to the Libyan Air Force strikes against Haftar's weapons and ammo stored in an area south of Tripoli. The Government of National Accord (GNA) strikes on this target were in response to Haftar's claims that it had received a Russian defense system, via the UAE, to protect supplies in this area.

The head of the GNA government, PM Fayez al-Sarraj, is now proposing elections this year to end the conflict. Given the carnage and destruction of Haftar's assault on Tripoli, Sarraj is now convinced of an electoral victory. This, however, will not happen. Haftar will not allow elections at this point and will absolutely not sit down at the table with Sarraj.

Conflict with Iran

There is still no definitive evidence that Iran was behind the tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman, but this conflict has taken on a life of its own and now we are dangerously near an all-out regional war from which there will be no end-game beneficiaries.

Iran has been backed into a corner and is now reminding the world that its ballistic missiles can take out an aircraft carrier. And Iraq will fall to war first. No further indication is needed than a rocket striking the residential and operations headquarters of oil majors in Basra early on Wednesday, with no claims of responsibility but immediately after Trump announced he would send another 1,000 troops to the Middle East. In the meantime, Washington's tactics concerning Iran appear to be continually wavering, suggesting that there is no actual policy in place. Late on Tuesday, right after announcing the 1,000-troop deployment, Trump referred to the tanker attacks as ""very minor"".

What investors need to know right now is that conflict has been provoked to a point where no single actor is in control. That makes for a very dangerous and uncertain future, especially with the nature of today's asymmetrical warfare. In attempting to use the conflict with Iran as a 2020 campaign booster, Trump has allowed this to go too far, and appears to be easily swayed by warmongers in his inner circle who were far too quick to put out video footage claiming to be evidence that Iran was behind last week's tanker attacks, despite the fact that the owners of the vessels in question have definitively refuted this. The US Navy also came out on Wednesday with a statement saying that ""mine fragments"" ""resembled"" Iranian mines, which is again not in the realm of conclusive evidence. This is not intelligence; rather, it is propaganda. It does not, however, matter whether it is one or the other at this point.

The Saudi Crown Prince, MBS, whom we have mentioned as the wild card here, is being tempered by Saudi King Salmon, who has publicly declared that the Kingdom does not seek an all-out war with Iran. The UAE, whose royal circle essentially created MBS, is also keen to keep things from escalating and so has not yet outright blamed Iran for the tanker attacks. From that perspective, it is interesting to follow the UAE media, which is calling for calm and restraint (and does so only with royal approval). All are now worried that this may have gone too far to turn back.

For the UAE, it is notable that two of the emirates are particularly impacted: Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Dubai is a major hub for Iranian business, accounting for almost all of the nearly $17 billion in non-oil trade with Iran last year. Sanctions have forced quite a few Iranian firms out of Dubai, and because Abu Dhabi has been one of the key lobbying forces for these sanctions in Washington, Dubai holds it responsible for provoking the situation to the edge of a dangerous conflict. The beneficiaries of all of this have been Qatar first and foremost, but also Oman and Turkey. Ironically, Qatar is under an economic blockade from the Saudis and the UAE, so it seems that all of these plans are backfiring now.

Egypt is also in a precarious position here. While is it expressing support for Saudi Arabia and the UAE - both of whom are its allies in the region - its media is also addressing the issue of Israel, which had the capabilities and motive for staging the tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman. Egypt has been careful not to explicitly denounce Iran over these attacks. Egypt has also withdrawn from ""Arab NATO"" - an alliance that was created specifically to confront influence. Some pro-regime media have alluded to the possibility that the tanker incident was perpetrated by the Israeli intelligence apparatus, while others suspected the US had a hand it in as well.

In the meantime, this regional conflict is most notably being played out with Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis who have now threatened to attack oil sites and tankers in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.

Exxon Exploration Will Face New Elections in Guyana

The Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), after a weeks-long delay, has upheld a no-confidence vote against the ruling government of Guyana, which in theory means that new elections must take place within 90 days. Guyana's current president, Granger, now says that elections will be held in late November. This is the election date Granger was initially targeting. We see no major upset here for Exxon, as both sides in what is essentially an ethnic-political battle hope to see first production move forward without delay. What they are really trying to do is ensure that their party is the one that ends up controlling the oil revenues, which means controlling parliament.

Global Oil & Gas Playbook

- Abu Dhabi's ADNOC national oil company is launching a new JV with Netherlands-based OCI, a producer and distributor of natural gas-based fertilizers and chemicals, which essentially forms the world's bigger nitrogen fertilizer exporter. Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris is the CEO of OCI. This deal allows them to corner five major markets: Asia, East Africa, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Latin America.

- Both Greece and Cyprus are planning to push for EU sanctions against Turkey if it is proven that it has indeed started exploratory drilling for natural gas offshore Cyprus, in the Cypriot EEZ. The Greek PM made the announcement this week, clearly hoping that the vague threat of sanctions will push Erdogan to withdraw from his provocative drilling campaign. Cyprus had threatened to block any new membership bids for the EU if Brussels failed to take decisive action against Turkey. Turkey is digging in deeper here, however, announcing plans to deploy a second drilling ship to the area to begin operations in July. Politically, Erdogan would not likely survive sanctions, which are also threatening to come from the U.S. (despite the fact that they are NATO allies) over Russian weapons purchases.

Despite the vastly escalated tensions with Iran, Washington has - very quietly - granted Iraq another waiver to import energy from Iran. This is not to be taken lightly. The waiver allows Iraq to continue importing electricity from Iran. This is another 90-day extension for Iraq. The thought here is that Washington will keep extending this waiver because Iraq really has no alternative to the 1.5-billion standard cubic feet per day of Iranian gas it needs to run its power stations. Not extending the waiver would result in massive unrest in Iraq, which would only play into the hands of the Iranian powers there. While Washington is pressuring Iraq to build the infrastructure it needs to forego Iranian gas, this isn't going to happen any time in the near or medium-term future. Barring an all-out war with Iran, the waiver is likely to continue being extended. This is a good barometer to watch: The US would have to be very desperate to cancel this waiver because doing so would itself launch a war in the region.

- Petrobras has announced a large discovery in Sergipe basin, where six fields are estimated to hold 20 million cubic meters of natural gas per day. Discovery is expected to generate $1.8 billion in annual revenue for the company.

- Equinor has made two small discoveries in the Norwegian Sea near its Norne field. The first discovery is estimated to hold between 1.8 million and 13 million barrels of recoverable oil equivalent, while the second is estimated to hold 0.6 million to 50 million boe/recoverable.

- Reabold Resources claims to have potentially discovered the largest onshore gas field in the UK, at West Newton in northeast England, estimating that it could contain at least 189 billion cubic feet of natural gas.

- Japan's Inpex Corp. has agreed on a framework with Indonesia for the Abadi liquefied natural gas project in the Masela block. Field development and the planned LNG export project will cost an estimated $18 billion to $20 billion. Inpex signed an agreement with the Indonesian government in 1998 to develop the offshore Masela block in the Abadi gas field. The Japanese company has a 65% stake. Shell owns the rest.

- Anadarko has greenlit construction of a $20-billion gas liquefaction and export terminal in Mozambique, the largest single LNG project approved in Africa. The facility will have two LNG trains with a total nameplate capacity of 12.88 million tonnes/year. The gas will come from the Golfinho-Atum field in Offshore Area 1 where Anadarko and its partners have discovered 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas resources.

11402501,2019-05-16,"The fighting in Libya has devolved into a protracted stalemate, which does not bode well for the country's oil production.

General Khalifa Haftar and his militia, the Libyan National Army (LNA), continue their assault on Tripoli and the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA). The attack began in early April, but the LNA has been bogged down on the outskirts of the city.

For weeks, Libya's oil production has held up surprisingly well. Output even rose a bit in April by 71,000 bpd, reaching 1.176 million barrels per day (mb/d), according to OPEC. The increase is impressive in the context of the outbreak of civil war.

But even though Libya managed to prevent production and export outages over the last few weeks, it's not clear that successful streak can continue, especially because a stalemate between the two factions only increases the odds that the country's oil sector gets caught in the crosshairs.

""Now the struggle is extending to Libya's surviving institutions, the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) and the National Oil Corporation (NOC),"" Hamish Kinnear, Senior Analyst for Verisk Maplecroft, wrote in a report on May 13.

At issue is the peculiar arrangement that has, to date, been behind Libya's success in ramping up oil production over the past year. The GNA based in Tripoli has international recognition and control over the country's most important institutions such as the central bank and the National Oil Company. But it doesn't have a sizable military. The LNA, on the other hand, has the guns, but not the recognition or political legitimacy.

Tripoli has sent the LNA funds in exchange for the latter's ability to stabilize and guarantee security over Libya's oil fields and export terminals. The LNA has paid off various local militias to maintain security, and that has often proven effective at keeping the oil flowing. In fact, the LNA's ability at quelling unrest and contributing to the restoration of oil production and exports has raised the stature of Haftar internationally.

But it may have also allowed him to grow overly confident. He thought his attack on Tripoli would be swift, but he has been unable to dislodge the GNA. So far, oil has not been impacted, but that could change.

The GNA and the Central Bank of Libya are moving to cut off the funds that flow to the LNA. ""Specifically, the governor of the Tripoli-based and internationally-recognised CBL, Al Seddik Omar al Kabir, has ordered banks to stop issuing letters of credit to the LNA,"" Hamish Kinnear of Verisk Maplecroft wrote. ""This will restrict the ability of the LNA to finance the import of the materials necessary to support its extended supply lines.""

As a result, the LNA may begin trying to sell oil through its own parallel National Oil Corporation based in the east, where Haftar's militia controls territory and a few vital export terminals. But this probably won't work. The UN has outlawed the illicit sale of oil from Libya. Oil traders probably won't touch oil not blessed by Tripoli and the legitimate National Oil Corporation. A prior attempt to sell oil outside the purview of the NOC in March 2014 ""ended with US Navy SEALs seizing an errant oil tanker,"" Kinnear wrote in the Verisk Maplecroft report.

Haftar is undertaking what appears to be a tour of Europe to shore up support and assistance. He has enjoyed the support, at times, of France and Italy, among others, who view him as a bulwark of stability against Islamic militants in North Africa.

But Haftar has squandered support by attacking Tripoli. Both the French and Italian governments are calling for a ceasefire. Amnesty International said there is evidence that Haftar and the LNA have engaged in war crimes by indiscriminately attacking civilian areas of the Libyan capital.

The stalemate also exposes the notion that Haftar and his army are the answer to Libya's instability - that he can roll over militants and unite the country - as disconnected with the realities on the ground. If anything is true, it's that no faction has the ability to impose order on the entire country. In assaulting Tripoli, Haftar is trying to impose his will on rivals, but the stalemate shows the limits of such a strategy, especially since disparate militias within Tripoli have united against him.

However, he is showing no signs of letting up despite the miscalculation and despite having lost some international support. The LNA has ""powerful friends with deep pockets,"" Hamish Kinnear of Verisk Maplecroft noted. The UAE and Saudi Arabia will likely ""step in with financial assistance"" if the LNA loses access to funds from Libya's central bank. In fact, even though many international players are dismayed at Haftar's reckless decision to reignite civil war, and they are calling on him to return to the negotiating table, these foreign governments are also worried about seeing him routed. The result is many actors are playing both sides, which arguably increases the odds of a stalemate.

All of this means that there is quite a bit of risk to a major supply outage in Libya. The attempt to sell oil outside of the confines of the legitimate NOC could lead to a ""repeat of the events of June 2018,"" Hamish Kinnear of Verisk Maplecroft warned. Haftar tried to export oil from terminals under a parallel NOC, but was unable to do so because Tripoli declared force majeure. Ultimately, 850,000 bpd went offline as a result of the standoff. Haftar backed down last year after several weeks of disruptions.

Meanwhile, if the LNA begins to see its finances strained, it could struggle to maintain security at key oil fields. ""In late April, for example, an armed group launched an attack on the LNA-controlled El Sharara oil field,"" the Verisk Maplecroft report warned.

No, European markets aren't being ""stung""--despite everything.

Instead, the triple whammy of a U.S. tariff threat, rising oil prices and waning optimism over a Brexit deadlock and have failed to put a damper on battle weary European markets. European stocks were only mildly lower on Tuesday morning as market participants turned their attention to the renewed tariff threat from Washington.

The pan-European Euro Stoxx 600 Index (SXXP) was down a mere 0.1 percent at open of business 0800 Hrs UTC, with most sectors and bourses slightly in the red. All leading markets were, however, able to reverse course, with SXXP flashing a 0.4 percent gain by 1000 Hrs UTC. This comes after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday proposed tariffs on a raft of European products as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies.

Meanwhile, crude oil is off to another bright start after a strong ending to the week Friday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was at $64.74, up 0.53 percent from Friday's close, while Brent Crude gained 0.25 percent to close the day at $71.28 per barrel. Both benchmarks have now climbed nearly 50 percent from their December lows.

There's a school of thought that holds that stock movements are inversely correlated with oil prices.

The USTR said the new tariffs are retaliation against more than $11 billion worth of damage from EU subsidies to Airbus that the World Trade Organization (WTO) has found causes adverse effects to the U.S.

Both the US and EU have been battling for 14 years over claims and counterclaims of illegal aid to their respective aircraft makers, Boeing and Airbus. Both sides have accused the other of paying out billions of dollars in subsidies so as to gain an advantage in the global airspace business. A recalcitrant EU has refused to stop with the subsidies, and has even doled out additional aid since the challenge as per the USTR.

Lighthizer has made it clear that the EU must agree to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft if it wants the U.S. to lift related duties and tariffs. The USTR says it will announce a final product list once a WTO arbiter evaluates the claims.

The general trajectory of the latest US trade impasse does not bode well for the markets. While $11 billion in tariffs is unlikely to cause much damage to the $19-trillion regional economy, readers should not forget that the unresolved trade war with China kicked off in earnest after the US imposed tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese imports before later escalating it to $200 billion.

It's probably going to take only a single round of retaliatory tariffs from either side for the transatlantic trade tensions to hit fever pitch.

London Stock Market Listings Plunge Nearly 70%

Trade spats aside, the EU has more than enough on its plate to worry about as is. That the region's stock markets have continued to perform admirably amidst all the Brexit snafu (SXXP is up 14.8 percent YTD) belies the fact that the political divorce could be causing plenty of damage elsewhere.

Specifically, reports have emerged that Europe's startups are no longer interested in listing. New listings on the London Stock Exchange plunged nearly 70 percent during the first quarter to £481m following the IPO of just five companies. That's the worst showing since 2011, and compares poorly with 16 admissions worth £1.3 billion for last year's corresponding period.

Clearly, few companies are willing to take the plunge during Britain's watershed moment.

No worries over oil rally

As for oil prices, investors should probably not lose sleep over it.

Crude has enjoyed a massive rally since late December, including many weeks of uninterrupted gains. The current run is being driven by OPEC production cuts, slowing growth in the U.S. shale patch, a rebel takeover of key oilfields in Libya, the political crisis in Algeria, Iran sanctions, and production and export declines in Venezuela.

However, the jury is out as to whether the market can sustain the rally for much longer.

In February, Goldman Sachs warned that Brent could hit $70-$75 per barrel before pulling back due to a surge in US shale output.

Haftar leads a self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) with a base in the eastern city of Benghazi. LNA is the main opponent of the UN-backed Libyan government based in the capital Tripoli in the west.

On Thursday, forces loyal to Haftar clashed with rival forces south of Tripoli, LNA representatives told Reuters.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who is on a visit to Libya to bring rival leaders across the country together for a national reconciliation conference, tweeted: ""I am deeply concerned by the military movement taking place in Libya and the risk of confrontation. There is no military solution. Only intra-Libyan dialogue can solve Libyan problems. I call for calm and restraint as I prepare to meet the Libyan leaders in the country.""

Oil-rich Libya, torn between a UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an alternative administration and institutions in the east, could see the years-long political crisis solved this month by the creation of a single government, Haftar said just a few days ago.

Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the division in Libya's political landscape has resulted in frequent attacks on oil fields and infrastructure from various groups. For years, Libya has been struggling to keep its oil production above 1 million bpd, compared to 1.6 million bpd before the clashes began.

Forces loyal to Haftar control the four oil ports in the so-called Oil Crescent in the east and the major oil fields there.

Forces loyal to Haftar control the four oil ports in the so-called Oil Crescent in the east and the major oil fields there.

In February, Haftar forces took control over Sharara, the largest oil field in Libya, located in the south and capable of pumping 315,000 bpd.

In early March, the Sharara oil field returned to operations after being closed for production in December, when clashes between militant groups forced the National Oil Corporation (NOC) to declare a force majeure.

Sharara has been one of the main reasons why Libya is widely seen as a wild card in global oil price forecasts. Since it accounts for around a third of the country's total oil output, Sharara, like the export terminals in the Oil Crescent, has become a natural target for various groups vying for power and control over Libya's oil wealth.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Tunis', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Benghazi']",Oil-Rich Libya Could Have One Government As Soon As This Month | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Oil-Rich-Libya-Could-Have-One-Government-As-Soon-As-This-Month.html,None,
11402505,2019-03-29,"Libya's oil revenues fell in February to $1.26 billion, according to its National Oil Company, as repeated oilfield closures continue to weigh on the troubled African nation.

The oil revenues were $330 million less than January levels, while overall oil production had actually increased by 23,000 bpd in February, according to OPEC's March Monthly Oil Market Report. Oil production in Libya fell in January to 883,000 bpd from 949,000 bpd in December 2018, rising to 906,000 bpd in February. Libya's oil production averaged 811,000 bpd in 2017 and 952,000 bpd in 2018. March production is expected to be lifted further.

Libya continues to suffer from oilfield and port closures both due to inclimate weather and internal strife over who will control its great oil wealth that resulted in a force majeure over the last few months.

Chairman of Libya's NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, last month reiterated its plans to boost production to 2.1 million bpd by 2021 if -- and that's a pretty big if -- it is able to improve its security situation.

To this end, BP said last October that it and Eni would be returning to Libya for a bit of risky business with exploratory drilling sometime during Q1 2019. Sanalla confirmed that BP was still interested in exploring oil in western Libya near its border with Algeria, and stressed that there were no security concerns in this area. Other foreign oil companies that may disregard the substantial security risks include Total SA, Repsol SA, and OMV AG, Sanalla told Bloomberg a couple weeks ago.

11402506,2019-02-20,"Libyan officials have stated that the control of the El Sharara oilfield has been handed over by LNA forces to Libyan oil security forces, the state controlled oil guards.

Even though Libya's national oil company NOC is based in Tripoli, which is in the hands of Western and UN-backed Libyan government or Government of National Accord (GNA), the majority of the country's oil fields are under control of Libya's General Haftar's LNA forces. The latter have taken control last week of the field, after negotiating a deal with petroleum guards and local tribes, who had closed down operations at the 315,000 bpd field.

Libya's NOC already had put in place a force majeure, causing operations to stop until a new security arrangement comes into place. Until now, it is not clear if NOC has agreed to a new security arrangement with Haftar's LNA, even now the latter has offered to support renewed operations. Naji Al Maghrabi, the eastern-based commander of the state oil guards, has called upon NOC to lift the force majeure. NOC also reiterated that without security arrangements in place, no resumption can be expected soon. An inspection team has been sent to assess security situation on site. However, the LNA and its militias maintain a no-fly zone, which points a potentially high threat level.

Looking at the ongoing military and political conflict between the UN-backed Tripoli government and Haftar's Eastern Province government, a deal is not yet to be expected soon. Since months, Haftar's LNA has been aggressively gaining the upper hand in the Libyan conflict, making the full control of Libya's oil and gas fields a top priority in a move to quell the financial strength of the Tripoli government. The restart of production at the El Sharara field could take longer than expected, as a new military confrontation between Haftar's allies and Tripoli cannot be ruled out.

The threat of a renewed LNA move to remove still strong opposition in the west of the country is growing. International concerns, however, have until now prevented a full-blown military attack on Tripoli and its government. UN envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame openly stated, in a meeting with East Libyan parliament Speaker Aguila Saleh that there is a need to end the deadlock. At the same time, Haftar has been meeting with Italian officials to increase Rome's support for the LNA approach. In Tripoli, GNA head Fayez al-Sarraj met with High Council of State chief Khaled al-Mishri, the latter just returned from meetings in Washington. Despite the fact that the GNA still has support from the US, UN and several EU countries, Haftar's LNA clearly has the upperhand. LNA spokesman Ahmed Al Mismari stated that the GNA is in a real crisis. Other LNA commanders even have vowed that Tripoli would be liberated soon.

Analysts expect Haftar's military push into the south of the country, officially to remove 'terrorist and foreign fighters' from the area, to be the prequel for a major offensive into GNA territory in the coming months. This would for sure end the possibility of a nationwide Libyan election, which is still on the agenda of UN-backed groups. Until now, we have not experienced a complete military escalation as northern LNA forces have refrained from attacks.

Worrying however are the movements reported by third parties in the Libyan crisis. Several reports show that Turkey and Qatar have stepped up their efforts to support militias, while Haftar's position is getting stronger due to open support of Egypt, Russia and the UAE. While no hard evidence has emerged of real military support by the Cairo-UAE alliance, videos have emerged of presumed Egyptian soldiers and military hardware operating inside of Libya. It is however clear that Haftar can rely on full Egyptian military support and intelligence. The UAE is also very active as a supporter of the LNA groups. Both Cairo and Abu Dhabi are supporting Haftar as a bulwark against Muslim Brotherhood led groups on the GNA Tripoli government side. They also are interested to remove any Turkish and Qatari power in a future Libya, as Ankara and Doha have been supporting Muslim Brotherhood groups in the region since the Arabic Spring. Tripoli may have support from the UN, Washington and Brussels, its future doesn't seem bright.

Haftar's coalition has been able not only to strengthen its control of a vast part of Libya, but also has set up very strong military alliance with Cairo, Abu Dhabi, Moscow and even Italy. Backed by these forces, Haftar's dream to clean up western Libya could soon become reality. Russia and Egypt are more than willing to increase their military and financial support, trying to strengthen their own foothold in Libya and open up future investment projects too. Egypt's oil and gas services companies already are vying for positions in the expected oil and gas Eldorado when the conflict is ended. Moscow's approach is still diffuse, as it still has reasonably good relations with El Serraj's GNA.

Haftar at present doesn't seem to be interested in any national reconciliation conference or holding national elections. The current strategy is clear, removing the opposition bit by bit, while taking control of the main revenue source of the country, Libya's oil and gas fields. The impotence of the GNA government militarily and financially will be seen as an opportunity to deliver the final hit. Most Arab countries, with the exception maybe of Qatar, are willing to put their support behind Haftar. Egypt and Russia have a lot to gain by having a strongman in Libya again. Cairo is looking for investment opportunities and security, while Moscow wants to have renewed access for its military and navy, to strengthen its Mediterranean position further.

The Sharara oil field, with capacity to pump 340,000 bpd, was shut down in early December and has been under force majeure since then, after armed militia claiming attachment to the local Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) seized control and demanded ransom to re-open it.

More than a month later, Sharara remains offline, and NOC which refuses to yield to ransom demands, said as early as last month that ""Oil production will now only restart at Sharara after alternative security arrangements are put in place.""

Sharara's shutdown will result in daily production losses of 315,000 bpd, plus a loss of 73,000 bpd at the El Feel oil field because it depends on Sharara for electricity supply, NOC said in December, noting that the ""combined daily cost to the Libyan economy of this unnecessary shutdown"" is US$32.5 million.

Earlier this month, forces loyal to eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said that they had started a military operation to secure oil sites and facilities in Libya's south, where Sharara is located.

Referring to Sharara, NOC's Sanalla said in London on Tuesday that ""The armed group attempting to hold NOC, and Libya's economic recovery to ransom, must leave the field before NOC will consider restarting production.""

Commenting on the military campaign in Libya's south, Sanalla said at a Chatham House conference, as quoted by Reuters:

""It is my concern that a sequence of events has been set in motion with unknowable consequences for Libya, and NOC.""

Expressing concern about the developments in southern Libya and Sharara, Sanalla said earlier this month: ""The restoration of security at NOC facilities is paramount to avoid further sabotage and theft of equipment ... Oil facilities must remain out of the purview of military operations and not used for political or economic leverage.""

According to six industry sources familiar with the issue who spoke to Reuters, NOC has declared force majeure on the Mellitah crude blend loadings, following the closure of the 73,000-barrels-per-day El Feel oilfield.

The oilfield was shut down last week due to an unlawful closure of a valve on the export pipeline from El Feel field to Mellitah, NOC said.

El Feel -- which NOC and Italy's oil and gas major Eni operate in a joint venture -- is one of the streams of the Mellitah crude blend, the other being condensate from the Wafa oilfield.

Last week's interruption of El Feel production was the second shutdown of operations at the oilfield in two weeks.

El Feel field was shut down on November 27 due to airstrikes, after the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Khalifa Haftar, retaliated after forces loyal to the UN-backed Libyan government in Tripoli allegedly took control of the oilfield in the southwest.

A day later, military activity at the field stopped and production resumed, NOC said on November 28, with NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla noting that Libyan oilfields are vital sources of revenues for the country and that the fields ""must not be treated as military targets.""

Libya's oil production was volatile in the spring and summer after Haftar -- whose forces control most of Libya's oilfields -- ordered in early April his Libyan National Army to march on the capital Tripoli.

Two outages at the biggest oil field, Sharara, in one month forced Libya's oil production down to below 1 million bpd in the first week of August -- the lowest level in five months.

Libya's production stabilized and even increased in September and October -- to 1.16 million bpd and 1.167 million bpd, respectively, according to OPEC's figures.

Without exploration, Libya can never hope to exploit its significant oil reserves - the largest on the entire continent.

The latest sign that the deteriorating situation is dampening the investment climate in the oil and gas sector comes from two oil majors, BP and Eni, which have shelved plans to install rigs and start exploration in Libya, the Petroleum Economist reports.

Eni and BP signed a deal in October 2018 to resume exploration in Libya, aiming to resume activities in 2019. Eni, BP, and Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) signed a letter of intent under which Eni would buy a 42.5-percent stake in BP's Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) in Libya.

""This is an important milestone that will help to unlock Libyan exploration potential by resuming EPSA operations that have remained suspended since 2014. It contributes towards creating an attractive investment environment in the country, aimed at restoring Libya's production levels and reserve base by optimizing the use of existing Libyan infrastructure"", Eni's chief executive Claudio Descalzi said one year ago.

BP's CEO Bob Dudley said in October 2018 that the companies would begin exploration drilling in Libya in the first quarter of 2019.

However, the worsening security situation in the country has ruined the plans for those two international majors to restart exploration activities.

On top of the tribal clashes and civil war in various regions of Libya, the oil industry is also continuously plagued by discord between rival governments and rival oil companies, threatening to break up the unity of the NOC.

Bickering over budget allocations is also threatening Libya's oil production.

At the beginning of this month, NOC also warned that Libya's oil production ""may fall precipitously over the next nine months if the government continues to withhold already approved budgets.""

11402746,2019-09-27,"- In Libya, it's not a good sign for General Haftar that the UAE - his ally - has publicly backed the Tripoli-based Libyan National Oil Company (NOC) after the general launched a bid to replace the board of an eastern unit of the NOC. There are some indications that the LNA strongman is giving in to some extent. Late on Wednesday, Haftar stated that he would be open to dialogue amid his offensive on Tripoli, which contradicts his continual rejection of UN talks to end the conflict. The UAE, which has been materially supporting Haftar's push on Tripoli, seems to have lost its taste for expensive conflict, and the writing on the wall became clearer earlier this month when it abandoned ally Saudi Arabia in Yemen and launched a second separatist front in this conflict in the south.

- As protests rock Egypt's main cities, Israel and Egypt have ostensibly cleared the last hurdle to exporting Israeli gas to Egypt. Holding up the deal was a transport obstacle and Israel's unwillingness to provide an offshore pipeline to run gas from the Tamar and Leviathan gas fields to feed the Egyptian grid. The new deal will allow Eastern Mediterranean Gas (EMG) to links its pipeline to the Israeli city of Ashkelon to el-Arish in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (where we note there are plenty of security concerns). This is a deal between private companies, rather than the Egyptian government. The benefit for the Egyptian government is longer term because this Israeli gas will be processed in liquefaction stations in Egypt for re-export to Europe. That could turn Egypt into a major hub for European gas.

- Paralyzed by political crisis since the fall of long-time Algerian leader Bouteflika, Algerian state-run Sonatrach is now believed to be in talks with Chevron for a potential shale deal. Deal talks had soured earlier this year while supergiants took a step back from Algeria to see how the political dust would settle. There is nothing concrete with these talks as of yet, but it is notable as the first visit by a giant Western oil firm since February. Exxon gave up on Algerian shale talks when the crisis climaxed in Q1.

- In addition to sanctions on Chinese firms transporting Iranian oil, the US has also slapped new sanctions on Venezuela and Cuba, specifically targeting those transporting oil from Venezuela to Cuba. The sanctions are meant to target Cuban interests aiding Maduro, but Cuba has its own problems to deal with in the form of a severe energy crisis that depends on cheap Venezuelan deals for its survival. Doubling down on its sanction-busting purchases, China has increased its crude oil imports from Venezuela for August, taking 1.45 million tonnes for the month, compared to 703,742 tonnes in July. But while the month on month purchases saw a sizable increase, the amount of crude flowing from Venezuela to China is down year on year, when it was 1.78 million tonnes.

- South Sudan's Boma State governor David Yau Yau has denied a watchdog report accusing him of creating an oil company with two British foreign nationals. The report accused South Sudan of conspiring with multinational corporations to profit from the war. In Yau Yau's denial, he pointed out that only the national government has the power to make oil agreements with foreigners. The still unfavorable risk environment in South Sudan may dampen enthusiasm for seven oil blocks that will be offered in October during the next licensing round.

Deal, Mergers & Acquisitions

- Houston-based natural gas company Tellurian Inc. has signed an MOU with India's Petronet to sell an 18% stake in its proposed $28B Driftwood LNG terminal and export five million tons of LNG a year from it for 40 years. This is a $7.5B deal ($2.5B in cash and $5B in debt) that will net Petronet an 18% equity interest. Petronet will also purchase five million tonnes per annum of LNG from Driftwood. The MOU is expected to be finalized by the end of first-quarter 2020, which means construction could also begin next year, as it already has FERC authorization.

Initially, Colombia is piloting 4 fracking projects which have the potential to bring in $5 billion a year once they are producing.

Legislation & Regulations

- Is Black Sea offshore oil back on? Not quite - but there's been a move in the right direction. The Romanian government has proposed a draft bill giving energy groups a larger share of earnings from offshore gas projects in the Black Sea. The new bill would change some stipulations of the current offshore law passed last year, that imposed burdensome financial conditions to investors. The law was criticized by some large investors like ExxonMobil and OMV, who earlier this year froze their Neptun Deep project, the biggest offshore project in the Black Sea, due to higher taxes. Neptun Deep was discovered in 2012 with an estimated 42-84 billion cubic meters of gas reserves. The new draft project proposed by the government reduces the total tax burden from 90% of estimated profits to 60%. Romania currently has had the highest effective tax rate for natural gas production. This has all but killed Romania's offshore oil potential. Exxon and OMV were set to decide on moving ahead with commercial exploitation by the end of 2018 but delayed that decision over changes to the law and new taxes.

- Brazil's upcoming $25-billion oil auction to be held on November 7 has received a regulatory boost with Congress' approval this week of part of a bill concerning revenue-sharing proceeds. This doesn't mean that lawmakers disagreements over revenue-sharing have ended.

Libya's National Oil Corporation reported $2.1 billion in income in July from its sales of crude oil and corresponding taxes, NOC said in a press release.

The figure represents a 23% increase over June, for an increase of $403 million. The revenue figures come from crude oil sales as well as sales of crude-derived products, taxes, and concession contract royalties.

The increase in income has been attributed to a busy June loading schedule, which cleared in July. But Libya's oil industry is not out of the woods just yet.

""In spite of month-on-month growth, Libya's oil sector remains vulnerable to security shocks. Two separate security incidents on the Sharara pipeline lowered revenue receipts,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanall said in the release.

According to the NOC, Libya relies on the crude oil industry for 92% of its overall revenue.

Despite the perk up in July revenue over June's, the last week of July saw Libya's oil production plunge to five-month lows as its largest oilfield, the Sharara, was still under a force majeure. The field had originally stopped producing on July 19 and restarted a few days later, but on July 31, production was halted yet again, with another force majeure implemented.

Libya's production subsequently fell to 950,000 bpd, from its 1.3 million bpd level prior to the disruption. This was Libya's highest daily production rate in six years. Sharara alone has the capacity to produce 340,000 barrels per day.

The security situation in Libya has materially worsened since the spring after Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that has escalated and disrupted, once again, Libya's oil production and exports.",OilPrice.com,energy,,['Libya'],Libya's Oil Revenues Up 23% In July: NOC | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyas-Oil-Revenues-Up-23-in-July-NOC.html,None,
11402748,2019-08-16,"OPEC's crude oil production fell by another 246,000 bpd in July compared to June, as Saudi Arabia deepened its cuts, as U.S. sanctions further trimmed output in Iran and Venezuela, and as an outage restricted production in Libya.

According to secondary sources in OPEC's closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report published on Friday, total OPEC crude oil production averaged 29.61 million bpd in July, down by nearly 250,000 bpd from June, and driven by lower output in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Libya, Venezuela, and Nigeria. Iraq and Algeria recorded the largest production increases, OPEC's secondary sources estimates showed.

The July crude production of the cartel members is a multi-year low, and close to the 29.42 million bpd production estimate in the monthly Reuters survey, which noted that OPEC's production was at an eight-year low last month.

Saudi Arabia, keen to restrain oil price slides amid a markedly bearish market sentiment, deepened its already deep cuts, slashing another 134,000 bpd to have its July production average 9.698 million bpd, OPEC's report showed. The Saudis have vowed to keep production well below 10 million bpd -- although their quota is 10.3 million bpd -- and exports at below 7 million bpd, aiming to tighten the market as demand growth weakens with gloomy macroeconomic prospects.

Iran and Venezuela, both under U.S. sanctions, also saw their production down. Iranian production declined by 47,000 bpd from June to 2.213 million bpd in July, and Venezuela's output dropped by 32,000 bpd to 742,000 bpd.

Crude oil production in Libya, one of the wildest cards in OPEC in terms of production consistency amid security concerns, fell by 42,000 bpd to 1.078 million bpd last month, after its largest oil field experienced two outages in two weeks. In the last week of July, Libya's production dropped to a five-month low below 1 million bpd, after a fresh outage at the Sharara oil field.

Even with OPEC's falling oil production, the cartel sees demand for OPEC crude next year even lower than the July production -- at 29.4 million bpd, or 1.3 million bpd lower than the 2018 level.

Commenting on the oil market and macroeconomic developments, OPEC said in its report:

""While the outlook for market fundamentals seems somewhat bearish for the rest of the year, given softening economic growth, ongoing global trade issues and slowing oil demand growth, it remains critical to closely monitor the supply/demand balance and assist market stability in the months ahead.""",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Venezuela', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'Nigeria', 'Iraq', 'Algeria']",OPEC Oil Production Continues To Slide As Saudis Cut Deeper | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Oil-Production-Continues-To-Slide-As-Saudis-Cut-Deeper.html,None,
11402750,2019-05-02,"OPEC production estimates from a couple of surveys are in and they suggest the cartel, despite its best efforts, has not been completely successful in its efforts to drive prices higher. Instead, it kept its production relatively stable last month, which has acted as a cap on international prices.

Reuters and Bloomberg both reported OPEC production figures for March yesterday, with both figures suggesting a relatively stable rate. The Reuters survey estimated a 90,000-bpd decline in overall production across the organization, with Venezuela and Iran, as usual, the ones that drove the total down, helped by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf partners, who continued cutting production under their OPEC+ deal obligations. The Reuters survey pegged the average daily for March at 30.23 million barrels.

Bloomberg's survey of data yielded a pretty close figure for the March total, at 30.3 million bpd, although it estimated this was 25,000 bpd higher than in February. Interestingly and perhaps contrary to expectations, one of the contributors to this estimated increase was Libya: one of the most unstable members of OPEC, and one that has been exempted from the cartel-wide cuts, managed to boost its production last month by resuming full production at its largest field, Sharara.

Iran's oil production, according to the Bloomberg survey, fell by 80,000 bpd to 2.63 million bpd last month and Angola also booked a decline in its output, of 60,000 bpd. Venezuela's output continued to decline, according to earlier data from TankerTrackers.com and from Reuters. Libya's production, however, rose by 90,000 bpd, more than offsetting the Iran decline.

Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, however, is arguably the main factor in the oil price game. The country has been cutting more than it agreed to in a bid to push prices even higher. At the same time, Riyadh, in the face of Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, has assured President Donald Trump in response to his calls for lower prices that it is ready to reverse the cuts whenever this becomes necessary. These assurances has served to keep a lid on prices after the U.S. State Department announced the end of sanction waivers for Iran's biggest oil clients, effectively betraying Saudi Arabia's purpose of pushing prices close to US$80 a barrel.

OPEC seems to have turned into one big wild card. While Saudi Arabia can keep its Gulf neighbors -- except Qatar -- in line and tweak production in accordance with their priorities, the rest of the large producers in the group are not so reliable. Besides Iran, Venezuela, and Libya, which are all exempted from the cuts and as such capable of surprises, there are also large producers such as Iraq and Nigeria, which both have plans to boost their production significantly and are eager to begin implementing them.

Just a few weeks ago the dominant talk in oil was whether the OPEC+ cuts would be extended to keep prices higher. There is still a chance for that but with so much uncertainty within OPEC itself and the newly increased competition pressure from U.S. oil, the discussions to take place later this month when OPEC+ meets will certainly be interesting. For traders, times will also continue to be interesting, it seems.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Iran', 'Venezuela', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Libya', 'Angola', 'Riyadh', 'Qatar', 'Nigeria', 'Iraq']",Has OPEC Reached Its Real Output Cut Goals? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Has-OPEC-Reached-Its-Real-Output-Cut-Goals.html,None,
11402751,2019-04-05,"Over-delivering Saudi Arabia and blackouts in Venezuela helped push OPEC's crude oil production down by 570,000 bpd from February to 30.23 million bpd in March -- the lowest production from the cartel in more than four years, according to the monthly S&P Global Platts survey published on Friday.

OPEC's de facto leader and biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, saw its production drop in March to the lowest level since February 2017. The Saudis delivered on their promise to cut more than pledged in the pact and slashed output by another 280,000 bpd last month, with March production at 9.87 million bpd, according to the S&P Global Platts survey.

Venezuela, for its part, saw its production drop to a 16-year-low, at 740,000 bpd, due to the massive blackouts that crippled oil production and exports in March, the Platts survey found.

OPEC's second-biggest producer Iraq cut its production by 100,000 bpd from February to 4.57 million bpd in March, according to the survey. This, however, was still slightly above Iraq's 4.512 million bpd production cap under the deal.

After an initial plunge following the U.S. sanctions on its industry, Iran's production has been holding relatively steady over the past couple of months, and the Islamic Republic pumped 2.69 million bpd in March, the Platts survey showed.

The resumption of operations at Libya's biggest oil field, Sharara, pushed Libya's production up to 1.06 million bpd in March, according to the survey.

Earlier this week, the monthly Reuters survey showed that OPEC's oil production in March 2019 fell to its lowest level since February 2015, as Saudi Arabia cut more than it had pledged and Venezuela continued to struggle amid U.S. sanctions and a major blackout.

The combined production of all 14 OPEC members stood at 30.4 million bpd last month, down by 280,000 bpd compared to February and the lowest level of OPEC production since February four years ago, according to the Reuters survey.

OPEC's production fell by 970,000 bpd from December to January -- the month in which the new production cuts took effect, with Libya, Venezuela, and Iran exempted. The monthly drop in the cartel's crude output was the steepest since December 2016 -- the month just before the previous round of cuts began, the Platts survey of shipping data, industry officials, and analysts showed.

Saudi Arabia's oil production in January stood at 10.21 million bpd, or 100,000 bpd below its pledged ceiling of 10.311 million bpd, and the lowest Saudi production since May 2018, according to the Platts survey.

The crude oil exports of OPEC's largest producer and de facto leader fell by 500,000 bpd to 7.20 million bpd in January, Platts trade flow data showed.

Among the members exempted from the cuts, Libya's production plunged by 120,000 bpd to 850,000 bpd as its largest oil field Sharara has been shut in since early December due to security risks and concerns. Iran, under U.S. sanctions, saw its production drop by another 80,000 bpd to 2.72 million bpd, while Venezuela's output fell 10,000 bpd to 1.16 million bpd. Sources at PDVSA have told Platts that as of this month Venezuela's production is expected to plunge because under the new U.S. sanctions, Venezuela will not be able to import U.S. naphtha to dilute its heavy crude grades.

The Platts survey showed a steeper decline in OPEC's production than the Reuters survey from last week.

OPEC's crude oil production in January dropped by a massive 890,000 bpd compared to December -- the largest monthly decline in the cartel's production since January 2017 when the initial production cut deal began, according to the monthly Reuters survey.

According to the survey tracking supply to the market and based on shipping data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC's crude oil production in January was 30.98 million bpd, down by 890,000 bpd from December 2018.

The largest production drop in two years came after OPEC's largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, as well as its Gulf Arab allies, cut deeper than pledged in the new production cut deal effective January 1, 2019. Production declines in the three countries that won exemption from the cuts -- Libya, Iran, and Venezuela -- also contributed to the steepest monthly production drop at OPEC in two years, according to the Reuters survey.

Among the three exempted producers, Libya's production and exports have been disrupted since early December due to port closures courtesy of bad weather as well as security incidents and issues at its largest oil field Sharara, which remains shut-in. With Venezuela's crisis deepening, production continues to fall, while Iran's oil output also drops as its exports are limited due to the U.S. sanctions.

According to the survey tracking supply to the market and based on shipping data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC's crude oil production in January was 30.98 million bpd, down by 890,000 bpd from December 2018.

Reuters data and estimates show that the eleven OPEC members bound by the pact -- excluding exempted Venezuela, Libya, and Iran -- reached 70 percent of the cuts they promised to deliver.

OPEC and its non-OPEC partners led by Russia agreed in December to remove a total of 1.2 million bpd from the market in the first six months of 2019, with OPEC cutting 812,000 bpd and non-OPEC producers reducing output by 383,000 bpd, including a 230,000 bpd cut from Russia.

Earlier this week, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih promised that the Kingdom would continue to overachieve in delivering its share of the cuts for the full six months of the agreement.

The state-held National Oil Corporation (NOC) of Libya has a budget of US$50 billion to invest in its oil and gas sector this year, as it looks to overcome safety and security challenges and restore oil production to the pre-civil war level of 1.6 million bpd, the chairman of one of NOC's subsidiaries told S&P Global Platts in Japan.

""Fifty billion dollars is the budget for this year to improve oil and gas production and to improve downstream [operations] but most of this is for crude oil,"" Shaaban Bsebsu, chairman of Ras Lanuf Oil & Gas Processing Company, told Platts on the sidelines of an industry event in Tokyo.

Libya is looking to boost its crude oil production to 1.6 million bpd in 2019 from around 1 million bpd currently, as it aims to solve security issues and invest in the upgrade of the old oil producing systems.

Libya plans to have its crude oil production reach 2 million bpd next year, according to the manager.

Bsebsu, however, underlined the security challenges Libya's oil sector faces, with various militant groups striving to gain control over oil infrastructure and assets.

The country's budget deficit halved in 2018 compared to 2017, thanks to higher revenues from oil, Libya's central bank said earlier this month.

It is the central bank that allocates the budget to NOC, after authorization from the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.

Yet, analysts think that with presidential and legislative elections this year, Libya could continue to face security problems at its oil infrastructure.

U.S. crude oil prices hit the lowest in 18 months in the last week of 2018, having slumped by nearly 40 percent from four-year highs hit in early October.

In the first week of 2019, oil prices jumped, supported by rising equity markets, signs of a possible U.S.-China trade war thaw, and signs that OPEC and its largest producer Saudi Arabia are slashing oil production, possibly by more than they had pledged in early December.

Some analysts now believe that oil prices, WTI in particular, may be primed for a new rally, due to technical indicators and to the supply and demand picture going forward.

WTI Crude prices slumped to $42.50 this past Christmas Eve, but have rallied by 10 percent since then. The previous time when the U.S. benchmark hit that $42.50 low was in June 2017, after which prices rallied by 80 percent, Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, told CNBC last week.

According to Maley, a rally could form this time around too, if WTI breaks above $50 a barrel -- the new resistance level around which prices bounced in November and much of December. Before the accelerated price slump in the last two months of 2018, $50 a barrel was the support level for WTI.

""If we can break above that and hold, that'll show that we got a real nice double bottom, much like we got in 2016, and should give us a nice upside rally. It may not be 80 percent but it should be a good rally,"" Maley told CNBC.

In the first days of 2019, oil prices had a good week, with Brent Crude rising by 9.3 percent and WTI Crude ending the week to January 4 up 5.8 percent. Brent Crude put up its best weekly performance in two years -- since December 2016. Oil prices were supported by declines in production in OPEC and good U.S. economic data that sent the U.S. stock market rising.

Going forward, the key bullish factors for oil prices would be OPEC and allies' cuts that began on January 1, slowing U.S. oil production growth because of the low oil prices in the past two months, and possible resolution of the U.S.-China trade war that has been threatening global economic growth and, as an extension, global oil demand growth.

According to Michael Bapis, managing directing director at Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management, oil prices are set for a rebound in the coming weeks and months, thanks to the OPEC/non-OPEC cuts and to lower-than-previously-expected U.S. oil production.

""We saw OPEC cut production by the most in two years, and it's starting to work this month. The U.S. oil production is also much lower than people expected,"" Bapis told CNBC.

OPEC's oil production in December dropped by 460,000 bpd from November -- the biggest monthly reduction since the initial cuts began in January 2017, according to the monthly Reuters survey. Saudi Arabia started to slash production earlier, output in Iran fell because of the U.S. sanctions, and Libya's production dropped due to a shutdown and unrest at its biggest oil field Sharara, the survey showed.

This month, OPEC may cut production even more than anticipated, according to a former Saudi Aramco executive.

In the United States, growth in energy sector activity slowed significantly in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Dallas Fed Energy Survey for Q4 showed last week, suggesting that growth has stalled amid the sharp oil price decline at the end of last year. Yet, U.S. oil production continued to hold at a record 11.7 million bpd level for the last week of 2018, according to the EIA.

On the demand side, global oil and fuel hinges on factors other than the price of oil, and many of those factors are increasingly difficult to predict amid fears that an economic growth slowdown is coming.

Hopes that the U.S. and China could make some headway in trade talks beginning this week have supported equity markets and oil prices in the past few days. The trade war has weighed on economic growth forecasts, making oil demand growth for 2019 more difficult to predict.

The key factors in the next few months will be how much OPEC and friends' cuts will help clear the oversupply, how much U.S. oil production growth could slow down with oil below $50, and how the global economic growth will hold.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'China', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Dallas', 'Libya', 'Iran']",Is WTI Set To Rally? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Is-WTI-Set-To-Rally.html,None,
11402756,2019-01-02,"Oil prices have regained significant ground since the Christmas Eve meltdown, and there is potential for higher prices in the weeks ahead.

Trying to guess what will happen next with oil is foolish, but several trends and upcoming events could pave the way for a tightening up of the oil market. As we close out the year, December could potentially go down as the low point in the latest price cycle.

To start with, the OPEC+ cuts take effect at the start of January, and in reality, even if the group does not reach the promised 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) right away this week (it surely won't), the reductions have been likely underway for some weeks. By some counts, OPEC production fell more than 800,000 bpd in December, most of which came from Saudi Arabia.

So, we start the New Year with big reductions in supply. The cuts will not balance the market right away, and there is disagreement from analysts over whether or not the size of the reductions is ultimately sufficient. At a minimum, the group may need to extend the cuts through the end of 2019 instead of letting them expire in June. But top OPEC officials have already signaled that they are willing to do that.

The second reason that the oil market may have bottomed out is that the waivers on Iran sanctions are set to expire in May. The latest data from Reuters shows that the volume of imports by Asian countries of Iranian crude hit a low in December at 664,800 bpd, down 12.7 percent from a year earlier. However, countries such as South Korea and Japan have indicated that, with waivers from the U.S. Treasury in hand, they could buy more oil from Iran beginning in January.

Thus, Iran may not necessarily play a bullish role in the oil market right off of the bat, but the waivers are set to expire in May. The Trump administration will probably be far less lenient this time around, and it will have a looser oil market giving it a stronger hand compared to late October/early November. Estimates vary, but Iran is expected to lose a significant portion of its oil exports, which, combined with the OPEC+ cuts, could go a long way in erasing the surplus.

Third, U.S. shale could finally undershoot growth expectations. This factor is admittedly speculative, but the crash in oil prices likely pushed a lot of shale drillers back into unprofitable territory. While many companies boast of low breakeven prices, around a quarter of them aren't profitable unless oil trades above $65 per barrel. At a minimum, plans for new rigs and new drilling could be scrapped. And indeed, there are early signs that is already happening. But if WTI lingers in the $40s for a while longer, there will surely be more severe revisions to 2019 drilling plans.

The EIA says the U.S. will add 1.2 mb/d of fresh supply in 2019. To the extent that the shale industry fails to deliver on this expectation, it will act to tighten up the market.

Another reason why the oil market could rebound from current levels is that there are few areas of significant supply growth outside of the U.S., and hardly any that could surprise on the upside. Canada and Brazil could add barrels onto the market, but not even close to anything that is expected from the U.S.

In fact, if there are supply surprises, the unexpected event is much more likely to be an outage. Nigeria has an election in 2019, which could spark unrest and put supply at risk. Production from Libya, as always, is fragile. Libya's production rebound in 2018 was impressive, but the gains are easily reversible. Venezuela's decline is much more certain.

The discussion up to this point has been all about supply. But, arguably, the oil market narrative in 2019 could be dominated much more by demand. Signs of strain on the global economy are piling up by the day. Stock markets have been rocked by volatility, the Fed's rate tightening has rattled confidence and increased the cost of debt around the world while also shaking emerging market currencies, and an economic slowdown appears underway in China.

Just this week, data shows that China's manufacturing purchasing managers index dropped to 49.4 in December, the weakest since early 2016. ""What is clear is that the global synchronized growth story that propelled risk assets higher has come to the end of its current run,"" Singapore-based Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. said in an economic outlook, as reported by Bloomberg. In China, ""a further growth deceleration remains on the cards.""

Forecasts from the EIA, IEA and other major energy watchers have demand growth at relatively strong levels, albeit slightly weaker than 2018. Any faltering in the global economy could more than outweigh the array of supply-side factors that could tighten up the market. Time will tell.

Most major investment banks on Wall Street see oil prices rebounding relatively strongly in 2019. Despite sharp downward revisions, bank analysts see Brent averaging in the $60s-$70s, which could require a rather significant rally given today's prices.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Iran', 'United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Venezuela', 'Nigeria', 'Libya', 'China', 'Canada', 'Brazil']",Why 2019 Could Start With An Oil Rally | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Why-2019-Could-Start-With-An-Oil-Rally.html,None,
11402802,2019-10-23,"It's official: Syrian Kurdistan has ceased to exist. Turkey and Russia have cut a deal that will allow Turkey to occupy a buffer zone in northern Syria, and that's where the Turkish gambit ends. That buffer zone accomplished two things: It removed the Syrian Kurdish threat to Turkey's border and created a space for Turkey to relocate Syrian refugees.

Syria's oil will now go to Assad, keeping in mind that Russia has exclusive E&P rights. The largest oilfield, Al Omar, was nominally under the control of the US and the Syrian Kurds until last week. While the Pentagon has said it is possible that some US troops will stay behind to protect this oilfield, that seems increasingly unlikely and unfeasible.

Now, assuming the remaining players on this field can fight back an ISIS re-emergence, the oil and gas will be Assad's - and Europe will want it.

This is the point where we get to see that geopolitical and military alliances such as NATO have lost their relevance to natural resources.

What will emerge out of this rubble is a new Syria, thanks to NATO-member Turkey, that - after a couple of hundred billion dollars in reconstruction - will emerge as a supplier of oil and gas to the European Union, and everyone will pretend that this isn't Gazprom, again. But it will be. Not only will Assad get his oil back, but Iran, Iraq and Syria will get a new Russian-backed pipeline that will further undermine Europe's attempt to get out from under the Russian energy thumb.

From a domestic political perspective, the move to abruptly step aside in Syria won't go down well with the American far right (if it fully catches on here) because it gives Iran a victory and re-establishes Assad's power over almost all of Syria, which is viewed as a threat to the Israeli holy land. That is even more cause for concern now that Israeli strongman Netanyahu has been sidelined in Tel Aviv.

Turkey's Other Gambit ... Libya

Turkey is spreading itself rather thin these days. In Libya, it's throwing its support (militarily) behind the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) against General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which is trying to overtake the capital. Turkish aid has emboldened the GNA, which has succeeded in pushing Haftar's forces back to the outskirts of Tripoli. Now, an arrest warrant has been issued for the general and his top commanders. Haftar has had more than a few setbacks recently, both militarily and in terms of reputation. He's not winning hearts and minds at this point. He's also having trouble in the south in a separate conflict with Tebu militias. That has sparked the so-far failed intervention of one of his key allies, the UAE. The fallout with this militia came about over an LNA drone strike that killed Tebu civilians and displaced large numbers of people. It does not mean this conflict is even close to a conclusion, though. Haftar still has plenty of oil cards to play, and control over oil is the key. He's also still got plenty of loyal militias signing on to his brand of thinking, including moderate Islamists (Salafists), who are seen as a bastion against radical Islamic fighters that have been propping up the GNA.

And, again, there's the oil. Haftar still controls major oil installations in the country's oil-rich south, and in the east, his stronghold. He also has important back channels in Washington, as well as the loyalty of some key Libyan oil magnates with relationships to both French and American oil giants who do not want to see the GNA try to take control of all the oil.

ISIS Makes Another Move Against Iraqi Oil

ISIS attacked checkpoints in Iraq's Allas oilfields in the northern province of Salahuddin Monday, killing four security force members and wounding five others. This isn't Basra; this is northern oil and is near previous ISIS strongholds. But it is an indication that ISIS thinks it can take back oil that it once controlled in this new atmosphere of chaos in both Iraq and Syria. ISIS controlled the Allas oilfields between 2014 and late 2017 when they were pushed out by a combination of Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi security forces. This is not yet a resurgence of ISIS. That will take some time. While it regroups, we expect an uptick in insurgent-style attacks, such as the one on the Allas oilfields. Currently, Allas produces some 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil.

Egypt's $30B In Foreign Oil & Gas Investment

Massive oil and gas discoveries and major infrastructure have transformed Egypt from an importer to an exporter. Those tension-raising power cuts shouldn't cause any more problems, and debt to foreign oil companies is due to be zeroed out sometime next year. Egypt is also set to boost its global power as a key energy hub, exporting to Europe (to beat dependence on Russian gas), Lebanon and Jordan. And while technically it has a rival in Israel when it comes to gas, all of Israel's gas will make its way to Europe via Egypt. (The only kink in this chain is the potential for another Arab Spring as protesters launch an unprecedented move against the Al-Sisi leadership for corruption and the regime fights back with an iron fist).

Foreign investors are swooning over Egypt, thanks to reforms and declining prices of oil and gas production. Nowhere has investment been higher: In five years, oil and gas companies have dropped $30 billion in Egypt.

So how should we view Shell's move now to get rid of its onshore assets in the Western Desert? Positively: This is a move to focus on what appears to be the much more lucrative offshore gas prospects. It's already won three offshore concessions and will start operating in Q2 2020.

Angola Is Desperate for Cash and Wooing Oil Investors

Angola is hoping to sell stakes in state-run Sonangol oil company and a string of other energy companies. To do that, it's banking on major economic reforms to attract investors and bring in much-needed cash. No one's forgotten the gross mismanagement of Sonangol under its previous leadership, though, so the Angolan government is going to have to pull out all the stops on this one. Sonangol is a wreck. The goal is an IPO for Sonangol in 2022. Beyond that, the government is also hoping to lure investors into stakes in Puma Energy, the China-Sonangol oil venture, and the Ivory Coast SIR refinery. But it's only been two years since we saw a change of regime in Angola, and investors don't seem thoroughly convinced just yet. In 2017, Joao Lourenco took power, ending the four-decade power play of Jose Eduardo dos Santos, along with his daughter's destructive leadership of Sonangol. Corruption had become entrenched to say the least, and two years isn't enough to undo the damage. Still, the reforms go a long way to making things seem attractive, even if they are done out of sheer desperation. The government has made it easier for investors to repatriate money via commercial banks; it's made it possible to invest in the sector without a local partner; and it cut taxes on some oilfields by 50%, creating an independent body for managing oil and gas concessions. The first litmus test will likely come later this year with the attempted sale of stakes in the SIR refinery.

Global Oil & Gas Playbook

- Rumors have surfaced from anonymous OPEC members that a December meeting will consider deeper production cuts due to anticipation that oil demand growth for 2020 will be a disappointing drag on prices. Deeper cuts for OPEC+ will also eat further into its market share, and the US, will be happy to fill that gap because it's now producing 12.6 million bpd, and climbing.

- US-based Chevron enjoyed a bit of a reprieve this week, with the US granting the oil major another 3-month sanction waiver for Venezuela. Chevron is also scheduled to receive a crude oil cargo from PDVSA, which would be the first such shipment this year as the US sanctions on Venezuela and state-run PDVSA have successfully curtailed the majority of crude oil shipments to anyone except for China, Russia, and Cuba. While the buyer of the 2-million barrels is Chevron, the destination port is unknown.

- Yemeni state oil company Safer has resumed pumping oil from Safer fields to the Arabian terminal at a rate of 5,000 bpd, and hopes to ramp up the production to 15,000 bpd. It will seek to avoid the Houthi-controlled Ras Issa terminal on the Red Sea. Yemen's oil production has fallen since 2014 from well over 100,000 bpd then to just 50,000 bpd last year. And the proxy war in Yemen is far from over: More border clashes with the Saudis this week, and Saudi airstrikes mean that Saudi oil is still vulnerable to attack.

- Royal Dutch Shell has quit two oil projects offshore Kazakhstan after high costs rendered them unprofitable. The Khazar field, of which Shell held a controlling stake, is set to be returned to the Kazakh state. Another abandoned project is the Kalamkas-Sea project, which is a joint venture with Eni, Total, Exxon and CNPC. Recently, the Kazakhstan government said it expected international oil companies to invest more than $5 billion by 2025 in new developments, mostly in those two projects. Media reported that Shell and the authorities could not agree on revenue, taxes and cost-sharing.

- Sweden-based refiner Nynas AB, owned by Venezuela's PDVSA and Finland's Neste Oil, will no longer accept imports of Venezuela's crude oil due to US sanctions. The company operates specialty refineries in Sweden, Germany, and England. The US Treasury earlier this year issued a license allowing limited transactions with Nynas, but that measure is set to expire on October 25.

- Dubai's Dragon Oil has acquired BP's stake in The Gulf of Suez Oil Company (GUPCO Egypt). Under the terms and conditions of the acquisition, Dragon Oil has become the contractor with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) instead of BP. Dragon oil said it will invest $1 billion over five years to boost and extend their production. GUPCO's target had been to increase the concessions' combined production to 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil by 2021--up from the current 60,000 bpd.

- Ecopetrol has entered into an agreement with Shell Brasil Petróleo to acquire 30% of the interests in the Gato do Mato discovery, located offshore in the Santos pre salt basin. Shell will reduce its interest 50% with this agreement and will continue as an operator, while France's Total will retain the remaining 20%. The companies did not disclose the commercial terms of the farm-out agreement.

- The United States is suing California for its cap and trade agreement on GHG with Quebec, arguing that it exceeded the scope afforded to it under the constitution when it entered into an international agreement over emissions. The suit argues that that is the exclusive role of the federal government.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Angola', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Tripoli', 'Tel Aviv', 'Basra', 'United Arab Emirates']",The New Oil Reality In Syria | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-New-Oil-Reality-In-Syria.html,None,
11402804,2019-06-17,"Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin's early June 2019 summit in Moscow with People's Republic of China (PRC) Pres. Xi Jinping seems likely to have a disproportionate influence on the next phases of the crises unfolding in the greater Middle East, and therefore on the future of the region.

The escalating confrontation between Iran and the US is both influencing and influenced by the mega-trends set by Russia and the PRC.

Although the key meetings took place on June 5, 2019, the seeds of the new joint strategy were already planted during the May 13, 2019, summit in Sochi between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. They went over all the key topics in preparation for the Putin-Xi summit.

On June 5, 2019, Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met in Moscow and decided to not only markedly upgrade the bilateral relations and alliance of their countries, but to use the new relations in order to shape the long-term posture of the entire Eastern Hemisphere in their favor. Emphasis was to be put on the Eurasian Sphere (the Kremlin's high priority) and the New Silk Road (the Forbidden City's high priority), as well as the Korean Peninsula which is most important for both.

One of the first major confrontations with the US by Russia and the PRC was to be over the greater Middle East. The main reason was the advance negotiations with all key oil producers -- including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran -- on substituting the petrodollar with a basket of currencies where the yuan, the euro and the ruble dominate. Using the currency basket would enable the sellers and buyers to go around the US-imposed sanctions and quotas. Indeed, Beijing and Moscow were now enticing the oil producers with huge, long-term export deals which were both financially lucrative and politically tempting by offering guarantees for the well-being of the participating governments.

The crux of the proposal is regional and includes flagrant disregard of the US sanctions on Iran.

However, the key to the extent of the commitment of both Beijing and Moscow lies in the growing importance and centrality of the New Silk Road via Central Asia.

Persia had a crucial rôle in the ancient Silk Road, and both the PRC and Russia now expect Iran to have a comparable key rôle in the New Silk Road.

The growing dominance of heritage-based dynamics throughout the developing world, including the greater Central Asia and the greater Middle East, makes it imperative for the PRC to rely on historic Persia/Iran as a western pole of the New Silk Road. It is this realization which led both Beijing and Moscow to give Tehran, in mid-May 2019, the original guarantees that Washington would be prevented from conducting a ""regime change"".

Therefore, even though both Russia and the PRC were not satisfied with the Iranian and Iran-proxy activities and policies in the Iraq-Syria-Lebanon area, it was far more important for them to support Iran, and also Turkey, in their confrontations with the US in order to expedite the consolidation of the New Silk Road.

Tehran and its key allies in ""the Middle Eastern Entente"" -- Turkey and Qatar -- are cognizant of the core positions of Russia and the PRC. Since mid-May, Tehran and, to a lesser extent, Ankara and Doha, were appraised by Moscow and Beijing of their overall direction of political decisions. Hence, since early June 2019, Tehran has felt confident to start building momentum of Iranian assertiveness and audacity.

Tehran has been raising its profile in the region.

Tehran insists that it is now impossible to make decisions, or do anything else, in the greater Middle East without Iran's approval. On June 2, 2019, the Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Maj.-Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, touted the new strategic posture of Iran. ""The Islamic movement has affected the entire world and on top of that, it has succeeded in intimidating the American hegemony and Zionism,"" he said. Bagheri attributed the new influence of Iran to the acquisition of regional strategic depth; that is, reaching the shores of the Mediterranean.

""At the advent of the fifth decade of Revolution, it should be noted that the expansion of the strategic depth of Iran has brought about new and undisputed conditions that today no issue in West Asia can be solved without Iran's participation."" No outside pressure, particularly US pressure, could, he said, compel an Iranian withdrawal and a reversal of its surge. ""The Iranian nation will not retreat in the slightest from its position on the country's defensive capabilities and will turn enemy's threats to golden opportunities to develop core achievements of the Revolution, especially in the defensive and missile sectors.""

Senior IRGC commanders with political affiliations repeated the message over the coming days. On June 7, 2019, Brig.-Gen. Morteza Ghorbani, an adviser to the Chief of the IRGC, called on the region's Muslim countries to join Iran. Instead of ""seeking the wishes and objectives of the global arrogance and the Zionists"", all Muslim countries should back Iran, Ghorbani explained, because ""together, we can establish an Islamic superpower"".

On June 10, 2019, Mohsen Rezaei, the Secretary of Iran's Expediency Discernment Council and a former Chief of the IRGC, stressed Iran's regional prowess. The Americans ""are aware that Iran's military strength is at a point where if they take the smallest action, the whole region will be set on fire. ... We are moving towards becoming a regional power and that is costly for America."" On June 12, 2019, Maj.-Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, the senior Military Aide to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i, stressed that with Iraq and Syria, Iran has created an unassailable bloc. ""The pivot of Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Mediterranean [region] is an economic, political, security and defensive axis against the Zionist regime and the US,"" Safavi explained. ""Iraq and Syria strategically play a complementary rôle to Iran.""

Little wonder that Tehran has also made clear that Iran intends to stay in Syria long after the war is over despite the misgivings of the Kremlin.

Damascus accepts Tehran's position, and should now be expected to reject all US-Israeli pressure to compel Iran to withdraw or even reduce the size of its forces. ""Damascus has no intention of turning away Iran's military assistance or demanding an Iranian troop withdrawal,"" Syrian senior officials told their Russian counterparts in early June 2019.

At the same time, although he is wary of confronting Iran directly, Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad demonstrated his displeasure with the Iranian presence. In early June 2019, for example, he rejected flagrantly Tehran's initiative for HAMAS and Syria to reconcile on account of the HAMAS cooperation with Iran and the HizbAllah against Israel. Assad justified the refusal by arguing that the HAMAS remained part of the Muslim Brothers' networks which had been fighting Damascus since the late-1970s and which continued to sponsor jihadist forces.

Meanwhile, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force continued to expand the Iranian strategic deployment in Syria. Most important was the completion, in the first week of June 2019, of the forward emplacement of ballistic missiles in addition to the deployments in southern-western Iraq and nearby in Iran. The Iranians maintained Qods Force missile sites (as distinct from storage sites for the HizbAllah) -- mainly Fatah-110 and Zulfiqar SSMs -- at the T-4 airbase in Homs province, in Jubb el-Jarah east of Homs, in al-Safira near Aleppo, and in the Al-Kiswah area south of Damascus. In early June 2019, the Qods Force brought Toophan-1 anti-tank missiles to the T-4 airbase. These are all areas and installations that Israel has bombed repeatedly. Yet, the Qods Force keeps repairing the damage and redeploying new weapons and missiles; an expression of their growing importance to the forthcoming regional war.

Russia has accepted the Iranian presence up to a point.

In early 2019, the Kremlin formulated a worst-case scenario focusing on maintaining a Russian presence along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean (beyond the Aleppo-Damascus highway) while blocking US/Western encroachment. Moscow is cognizant that such an area of influence along the shores of the Mediterranean also means blocking the vital arteries of transportation which both Iran and Turkey are determined to establish.

In early June 2019, the Russians demonstrated the point that the western zones are Russia's, and only Russia's. Toward this end, the Russians compelled the Syrian military to force the Pasdaran, HizbAllah and Afghan Fatemiyoun units out of the Syrian base in Latakia.

Meanwhile, the cooperation between Iran and Turkey has expanded as agreed, but faster than expected.

Starting late May 2019, senior officials of both countries increased the number of bilateral visits in a concentrated effort ""to find common ground in which Turkey helps Iran overcome the consequences of US sanctions"". By June 1, 2019, Iran and Turkey established a ""new anti-sanction financial mechanism"" with priority given to increasing the imports of natural gas and oil from Iran (with some of the oil laundered as Iraq-origin from Kirkuk). Iran and Turkey also agreed to protect mutual trade and economic ties, including the establishment of a joint bank, in the face of US sanctions. As well, both countries finalized an agreement to restart direct cargo train and passenger/tourist train services between Tehran and Ankara.

On June 8, 2019, Iranian Pres. Hassan Rouhani had a lengthy phone conversation with his Turkish counterpart, Reçep Tayyip Erdo?an. They finalized and formulated the new era in bilateral relations, ranging from economic cooperation to effecting regional dynamics.

Rouhani opened by emphasizing the importance of the expansion of relations between Iran and Turkey in the global and all-Islamic spheres. ""Development of relations and cooperation between Iran and Turkey, as two powerful effective countries in the world of Islam, is important for stability and security of the region."" He pointed to the instability and bloodshed in countries such as Sudan, Libya, Yemen, and Afghanistan, and invited Erdo?an to work with Iran to resolve conflicts throughout the Muslim world. ""Together, Iran and Turkey can cooperate with other friendly, brotherly countries to put an end to this regretful process and resolve the issues of the region and the world of Islam as well."" Rouhani said that Iran was most interested in markedly expanding bilateral economic cooperation, including providing highly-subsidized oil and gas to Turkey, while using national currencies in trade transactions to avoid the US sanctions.

In his response, Erdo?an largely agreed with Rouhani and reiterated Turkey's commitment to confronting the US. Closer bilateral cooperation was a must. ""As two brotherly, friendly countries, cementing of relations between Iran and Turkey can be beneficial for both nations and the region.""

Erdo?an concurred that it was imperative to ""enhance bilateral relations in all fields, especially in economy and trade"", and agreed with Rouhani on ""the importance of using national currencies in trade"". He termed the US ""unilateral sanctions against Iran"" as ""tyrannical"". Hence, Turkey ""will never accept these cruel sanctions and seek to increase our friendships and cooperation with Iran"". Erdo?an agreed that both countries must influence the region and ""the world of Islam"". Erdo?an concluded: ""Iran and Turkey can play a greater rôle by expanding their engagement and cooperation in the development of regional stability and security and counter-terrorism.""

Both Presidents agreed to escalate their joint anti-Kurdish campaign, as well as better coordination of their activities in Iraq and Syria.

By the time of the Rouhani-Erdo?an conversation, Turkish and Iranian forces were already engaged in a comprehensive anti-Kurdish offensive for more than a week.

The raids and bombings were conducted both in northern Iraq and along their mutual border. At first, the heaviest fighting took place in Turkey's Igdir province, close to the borders with Armenia and Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan Autonomous Region. The Turkish forces then moved to the Aralik district, close to the Turkish-Iranian border. At that point, the IRGC conducted a parallel operation in Chaldoran County bordering Igdir-Aralik. The Turkish and Iranian forces continued to move southward along the border, destroying the Kurdish pockets between them.

Meanwhile, Turkey launched a major offensive, Operation Claw, into Iraqi Kurdistan. As a separate element of the operation, the Turkish forces conducted deep raids closely coordinated with the Iranian forces. Most important were the attacks against PKK positions in the Hakurk mountainous region near the Iraqi border with Iran. The Iranian forces have been preventing the Kurds from escaping across the Iranian border as in previous Turkish raids. IRGC forces also clashed with Kurdish groups; both the Iranian-Kurdish PJAK and the Turkish-Kurdish PKK forces usually based in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Iranian raids, which include crossing of the Iraqi border, were coordinated with heavy air-strikes by the Turkish Air Force of the nearby regions of Zap and Qandil.

Concurrently, Qatar, on behalf of the bloc, challenged and effectively neutered the Mecca summits from within. The Qatari Prime Minister Abdallah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani participated in all three summits on May 30-31, 2019.

Despite the Saudi-led GCC boycott on Qatar, he had a most courteous exchange with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin 'Abd al-'Aziz al Sa'ud. The main reason for Qatar's presence in Mecca was to obtain and relay messages from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin 'Abd al-'Aziz al Sa'ud (aka MBS) and his close partner the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (aka MBZ) to Tehran.

The key message was that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States did not want war with Iran, and would do whatever they could to prevent the US from launching one. Both MBS and MBZ noted that the US was stopping short of direct confrontation, with the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group remaining out in the Arabian Sea rather than venturing across the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf as US carriers had done in the past.

Tehran, however, would not legitimize any stand of either MBS or MBZ even though Tehran welcomed their message as transferred by Doha. Therefore, within days after the end of the summits, Qatar started to openly criticize and contradict the Mecca Summits' resolutions and communiqués. Doha thus flagrantly shattered the delicate consensus which Riyadh had worked so hard to create, including the Saudi statement that ""reconciliation with Qatar [is] possible"" given the right circumstances.

On June 2, 2019, Doha asserted that the Mecca communiqués reflected ""America's policies on Iran"" and not the self-interests of the region's states. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, who also attended the Mecca summits, criticized the declaratory refusal to negotiate with Iran even though Doha passed secret messages to Iran throughout the summits. ""The statements condemned Iran but did not refer to a moderate policy to speak with Tehran,"" he said on Al Jazeera TV. ""They adopted Washington policy towards Iran, rather than a policy that puts neighborhood with Iran into consideration."" Al-Thani argued that any cooperation with Tehran should be based on ""non-interference in other countries"".

On June 5, 2019, Iranian Pres. Hasan Fereidun Rouhani coordinated policies in a phone conversation with the Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Rouhani reiterated that Iran was not interested in a war with the US or anybody else. However, should ""any foolish anti-Iranian act start in the region"", Iran would deliver ""a firm response"" which would harm the Arabian Peninsula more than anybody else. War would be futile, he noted. ""Regional problems don't have a military solution and we believe that threat, pressure, blockade, and economic sanction are wrong approaches in relations between governments."" Rouhani hailed Qatar's stance because it contributed to easing regional tensions. ""Certainly, any meeting will be ineffective, unproductive and even harmful, if it doesn't draw regional countries to each other,"" Rouhani affirmed Doha's policy.

Sheikh Tamim responded by emphasizing that the policies and stances of Tehran and Doha were ""close to each other"" on most issues. He reiterated that Doha believed that ""dialogue is the only way to ease tensions,"" and that Doha wanted ""to expand ties with Iran in all areas"". Sheikh Tamim concluded that all Qataris are ""appreciating Tehran for supporting [Qatar] during the blockade"".

Apprehensive of the specter of a US escalation, Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Thani traveled to London on June 9, 2019, to try and get ""a friendly message"" across to Washington. He warned the US not to fall into the trap set by MBS and MBZ. He explained that the ""Saudi and Emirati plan to impose stability on the region by supporting authoritarian governments and military councils in Africa, Egypt, Libya, and throughout the Arab world was a recipe for chaos"". These ""policies are [only] creating more terrorism, conflict and chaos in the Middle East and Africa"".

For its own good, the US must not be part of the scheme. Discussing the situation in the Persian Gulf, Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Thani noted that ""while Qatar respects US policy towards Iran, it cannot fully support it because Qatar views the matter from a regional perspective"". He criticized Washington's stance. ""The current US position on Iran lacks any indication of a way forward, or any type of positive or constructive message."" Doha did ""not want to see any confrontation between the two powers, US and Iran, because we are stuck in the middle,"" he concluded.

But the US kept escalating its covert war with Iran, both in the Persian Gulf and in Syria. The extent of the escalation and the focusing on objectives of great importance for Iran could not but lead to Iranian harsh reaction.

First came escalation of the campaign against the transfer of oil along the long desert road stretch between Deir ez-Zor and Damascus. Since the beginning of the war, Damascus had been purchasing oil from whomever controlled the oilfields east of the Euphrates, be it DI'ISH or the US-sponsored Kurdish PKK/YPG/SDF forces. As well, with the opening of the road from Iran via Iraq, the Iranians increased the shipment of oil in tanker-trucks. Since the Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) would not strike and shut down the lucrative oil trade, the US chose to rely heavily on the jihadist forces being trained and equipped in the al-Tanf area.

According to tribal leaders in the Deir ez-Zor area, the US launched at first ""a campaign ... to prevent smuggling [oil] from areas under SDF control in Deir ez-Zor to the Syrian regime by way of ferries across the river"". The first major escalation took place in the early morning hours of May 31, 2019. Jihadist forces near al-Shuhayl opened heavy machinegun fire on four tanker-barges ferrying oil across the Euphrates. When the ambush failed to cause any tangible damage, US combat helicopters and strike aircraft showed up and strafed the barges, blowing up three of them and causing at least four fatalities.

Although the US denied that the May 31, 2019, attack took place, the mere involvement of US forces compelled the US to change tactics. The emphasis moved to on-land raids and ambushes along the desert stretch north of al-Tanf, the vast Badiyah al-Sham (eastern desert) area. There, properly trained and equipped light forces could, on their own, strike and burn the tanker trucks moving in small convoys. As well, there was no question of conflict of interests with the US-proxy Kurdish forces. According to Syrian military officials, ""the ISIL's movements have taken place in line with US' objectives to exert pressure on the Syrian Army and its allies in Syria"". The officials stressed that ""the US is trying to help the ISIL block roads leading to Badiyah due to Badiyah's strategically important oil and gas reserves"".

The main jihadist operations were taking place between Eastern al-Sukhnah and Deir ez-Zor, including the important T-3 Pumping Station and the Palmyra area. Some of these jihadist forces were using HUMMER-type vehicles in addition to the ubiquitous Japanese-made light trucks. Starting June 3, 2019, the jihadists used US-made TOW anti-tank missiles to strike Syrian armored combat vehicles escorting the tankers. The first such strike took place in the Jabal Bishri area.

By June 7, 2019, the jihadists had escalated their concentrated attacks on the traffic in the main desert route, hitting both Syrian and Iranian vehicles, and not just oil tankers and their escorts. The jihadists deployed several hundred fighters from the camps in the al-Tanf area, compelling the Syrian military to divert forces from their anti-DI'ISH operations in the Baqouz region in Eastern Euphrates province. The jihadist forces were operating over wider areas including the area of Jabal al-Bashri in south-eastern Raqqa, al-Dafinah in southern Deir ez-Zor, between Palmyra and al-Sukhnah, and the surrounding areas of al-Tanf in Eastern Homs. On June 11, 2019, the jihadists launched their first attack on the western axis of the T-3 Pumping Station near Palmyra. The jihadists also stormed army positions near the desert road east of Palmyra, causing heavy damage and numerous casualties.

By mid-June 2019, the intensity and frequency of jihadist ambushes had increased still further. These ambushes, Syrian defense officials explained, ""are well-coordinated and [a] proof that the terrorist group possesses the ability to wreak havoc inside the country"". By now, according to these officials, there were some 2,000 to 3,000 jihadist fighters in the entire Badiyah al-Sham region who were living off the main US-sponsored bases in the al-Tanf area. The escalation has strategic impact because the Syrian military has had to divert reinforcements earmarked for the major offensive in Idlib (the last major pocket of the US-sponsored al-Qaida affiliated jihadists, both Syrian and foreign) to secure the desert roads.

Then, as promised to the jihadist fighters by the US recruiters in March 2019, on June 2, 2019, the US-proxy Kurdish authorities running the al-Hawl camp released more than 800 women and children -- all families of DI'ISH fighters -- and handed them to their families who happened to live in the al-Tanf area. This was the first such transfer of non-combatants and more were expected soon.

Meanwhile, a ""mysterious"" escalation took place in the northern part of the Persian Gulf.

On June 5, 2019, huge fire consumed a storage facility for oil products at the Shahid Rajaee port in southern Hormozgan Province. Located west of Bandar Abbas, the Shahid Rajaee port is Iran's largest container shipping port. Reportedly, a vehicle used for transporting shipping containers exploded and caught fire. Since there were oil products near the site of the explosion, the blaze spread quickly to several tanks and storage sites and caused heavy damage to the port. The spreading fire set off huge explosions which shot fireballs and heavy smoke high into the air.

On June 7, 2019, six Iranian merchant ships were set ablaze almost simultaneously in two Persian Gulf ports.

First, five ships ""caught fire"" in the port of Nakhl Taghi in the Asaluyeh region of Bushehr Province. Three of these ships were completely burned and the two others suffered major damage. Several port workers and sailors were injured. As well, at least one cargo ship burst into flames and burned completely at the port of Bualhir, near Delvar. The fire was attributed to ""incendiary devices"" of ""unknown origin"". The local authorities in Bushehr Province called the fires a ""suspicious event"" and went no further.

In Tehran, senior Iranian officials first attributed the incident to ""fires caused by high temperatures"". Subsequently, they pointed out to statements by Iranian opposition activists in Europe (NOT the MEK) who ""made the connection between the mysterious fires that hit the Iranian ships and the sabotage"" of the tankers in Fujairah. Several diplomats in Tehran reported that the local grapevines were attributing the fires to ""expert mercenaries"" of ""unknown origin"". ""Knowledgeable Iranians"" opined, the diplomats reported, that ""ferocious revenge"" was only a question of time.

Indeed, in the early morning hours of June 13, 2019, two large tankers were repeatedly attacked and set aflame in the middle of the Gulf of Oman. Both tankers were subsequently abandoned by their crews and left to drift, burn and sink. By end of the day, there were conflicting reports whether they already sank. The tankers did not sink and most of the flames died down on June 15, 2019. Hence, efforts started tow the tankers to UAE ports.

A few hours before the attack, a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observed IRGC fast attack boats, most likely from the nearby Bandar-e-Jask naval base, gather and advance toward the area where the tankers would be struck. When the Iranians noticed the UAV, they launched a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile. The missile overshot, narrowly missed the MQ-9, and crashed into the water. However, the UAV was pulled away from the scene so that there would be no evidence of the attack that unfolded shortly afterwards.

Both tankers were subjected to repeated attacks over three hours in order to ascertain their destruction. The Norwegian owned MT Front Altair was first hit by a torpedo attack which stopped it and started a small fire. The Front Altair was then subjected to two cycles limpet-mine attacks which caused at least three major explosions and set the tanker aflame. The Japanese owned Kokuka Courageous was also subjected first to a torpedo attack which breached the hull above the water line. Over the next three hours, the Kokuka Courageous was subjected twice to limpet-mine attacks, as well as a couple of 107mm rockets (most likely launched from an IRGC Seraj-1-class fast attack boat), which also set the tanker aflame. Both tankers were first hit in the engine-room area so that they stopped. The main tanks were then repeatedly bombed until they burned out of control.

The predominantly Russian crew of the Front Altair was rescued by an Iranian vessel and brought to a nearby port in Iran. The predominantly Filipino crew of the Kokuka Courageous was rescued by local tugboats and then moved to the US destroyer Bainbridge. Tehran continued to insist that all 44 crew members of both tankers were rescued by the Iranian Navy and safety authorities.

The initial expert analysis of the attacks strongly suggested a professional operation.

""These appear to be well planned and coordinated attacks,"" wrote shipping experts in the Gulf States. They noted that the two tankers were first hit in close proximity to the engine room and thus were stopped. They were then subjected to strong explosions at or below the waterline. Such explosions were most likely caused by limpet-mines similar to those used in Fujairah on May 12, 2019. The USS Bainbridge reported that it saw ""an unexploded limpet mine on the side of one of the ships attacked in the Gulf of Oman"". The next day, a US UAV spotted an IRGC Zulfiqar-class fast attack boat approaching the tanker where the crew removed the unexploded mine. The experts concluded that ""a state actor is responsible"" for the attack.

In all likelihood, the strike was carried out by members of the Sepah Navy Special Force, an independent Takavar unit of the IRGC Navy, and/or foreign Shi'ite jihadists trained by them. The attackers operated from the military port in Bandar-e-Jask in the Southern Hormozgan Province of Iran. The mother ship of the Fujairah attackers was believed to have sailed from Bandar-e-Jask. The IRGC Navy base was established there in 2008. Several years later, it was expanded to include the headquarters of the Iran Navy's 2nd Naval District. Bandar-e-Jask is the home base of a unit of the IRGC's Ghadir midget submarines, a wide variety of IRGC fast attack boats, (including the Seraj-1 and Zulfiqar classes), and long-range UAVs used for operations over the Persian Gulf. The Ghadir midget submarines are equipped with the Jask-2 anti-ship missiles and Valfajr torpedoes (which might have been used to attack the two tankers).

The initial media coverage of the incident was of significance.

The first reports came rather quickly on the Iranian Al-Alam News Network which broadcasts in Arabic and covers the entire Arabian Peninsula. Al-Alam reported that two ""giant oil tankers"" had come under ""attack"", that ""two explosions"" took place, and that the tankers were aflame. These reports were then picked up by the Persian-language Iranian media; first the IRGC-affiliated Tasnim News and then the propaganda channel, Press TV, which broadcasts in several languages worldwide. Only then the media in the Middle East and the global media started to pay attention to the strike.

Subsequently, official Tehran began addressing the issue; warning Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States against hastily attributing the attack to Iran. ""All regional states should be careful not to be entrapped by deception of those who benefit from instability in the region,"" Iranian Government Spokesman Ali Rabie said. ""The Iranian Government is ready for security and regional cooperation to guarantee security, including in the strategic waterways.""

The attack on the tankers in the Gulf of Oman cannot be seen in isolation.

They were part of a comprehensive policy against Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, but timed in the aftermath of the attacks on the Iranian ports. In early April, a three-phase escalating war plan was drawn under Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani in order to deprive the West of access to the Arabian Peninsula's oil if US sanctions persisted and Iran could no longer sell oil.

The first phase was to signal Iran's resolve and might; the second, sinking tankers transferring oil from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, as well as blocking the Strait of Hormuz; and the third was to destroy the entire oil and gas infrastructure throughout the Arabian Peninsula. In late-April 2019, Maj.-Gen. Mohammed Hossein Bagheri alluded to the Iranian resolve. ""If our oil fails to go through the Strait, others' crude will not either,"" Bagheri warned. The Fujairah attack and the Gulf of Oman attack corresponded with the first two phases of Soleimani's plan. The third was also tocome.

The attack on the Japanese owned Kokuka Courageous was fortuitous because it happened just as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting Tehran in effort to convince Tehran that US Pres. Donald Trump was serious about comprehensive negotiations with Iran. On June 13, 2019, Abe met with Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamene'i who set the tone for Iran's harsh policies.

After pleasantries, Abe told Khamene'i that the primary objective of his visit was to convey a special message from Pres. Trump. ""I would like to give you a message from the President of the United States,"" Abe told Khamene'i. Khamene'i exploded and told Abe his mission was doomed and futile from the very beginning. ""We have no doubts about your goodwill and seriousness, but with regard to what you relayed from the US President, I see no merit in Trump as a person to deserve the exchange of any messages, and I do not have any answer for him and will not give him any either,"" Khamene'i replied.

Khamene'i then addressed the nuclear issue, repeating the falsehood of his own fatwa forbidding nuclear weapons. However, Khamene'i stressed that the US or the EU had no say in whether Iran would or would not have nuclear weapons. ""We are against nuclear weapons and my fatwa bans their development. However, you should know that if we decide to develop nuclear weapons, the United States will be unable to do anything,"" Khamene'i told Abe.

According to the Mehr News Agency, Abe delivered five specific requests from Trump to Khamene'i. Mehr cited ""Trumps' five requests and the Leader's direct answers to them:

""Trump: The US is not intended to change the regime in Iran.

""Leader: This is a lie for if the US could do that it would but this is what US is not capable of doing.

""Trump: We want to re-negotiate nuclear issues.

""Leader: Iran held talks with the US for five to six years over nuclear issues and reached a conclusion but the US withdrew from the deal. This is not reasonable to re-negotiate things with a country who has ruined all the agreements.

""Trump: The US seeks to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons.

""Leader: We disagree with nuclear weapons and I have announced it Haram in a Fatwa but you should know that if we wanted to make nuclear weapons the US could not prevent us.

""Trump: The US is ready to start honest negotiations with Iran.

""Leader: We do not believe in that, since honest negotiations are far from a person like Trump. Honesty is rare among American officials.

""Trump: Holding talks with the US will make Iran improve.

""Leader: Under the mercy of God, we will improve without having negotiations with the US and despite the imposed sanctions.""

The other important meeting Prime Minister Abe had was with Pres. Rouhani. According to Rouhani, they discussed ""stability and security of the region"". Most important was Abe's reiteration that Japan remained interested in purchasing Iranian oil despite the sanctions. ""Japan's willingness to continue purchase of oil from Iran and to boost financial, scientific and cultural cooperation will be a guarantee for development of ties,"" Rouhani stated.

Ultimately, Russia and the PRC were the prime, long-term beneficiaries of the brewing crisis in the Persian Gulf.

Both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping were in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, on June 14, 2019, for the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Rouhani was also participating. After the attack on the tankers, the US attention again focused on the Persian Gulf and away from the escalation of the confrontation with the PRC and Russia.

Meanwhile, both Putin and Xi were, in Bishkek, leading the dramatic strengthening of both the Eurasian Sphere and the New Silk Road. The US handling of both the trade/tariff war with the PRC, and the Persian Gulf crisis, as explained by Rouhani, had convinced Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Central Asian leaders in attendance to seek closer ties with Russia and the PRC. The SCO was further enthused by the decision, announced by Xi Jinping, to divert major PRC investment funds from the US to Central Asia and the New Silk Road. Indeed, Russian and PRC officials defined the Xi-Putin-Modi meeting in Bishkek as being ""vital for re-shaping the world order"" and as a major setback to the US attempt to dominate the forthcoming G20 summit in Osaka, Japan.

Meanwhile, Tehran continued to prepare for an escalation to come. On June 14, 2019, Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi led a senior delegation to Damascus where it met with leaders of Palestinian terrorist organizations, HizbAllah and other Shi'ite jihadist factions. In the meeting, the Palestinian leaders emphasized the ""interconnected rôle of the resistance axis' forces and countries in the region in confronting schemes and threats that target Iran, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon"". Indeed, Egyptian senior intelligence officials now claim that the recent launching of rockets from the Gaza Strip was conducted by ""regional elements"" tied with ""the attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.""

Concurrently, Qods commander Qassem Soleimani continued traveling clandestinely throughout the Middle East, preparing his extensive and growing forces, both Iranian and Iran-proxy, for a direct clash with the US and its allies should Khamene'i give the order.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Washington, D.C.', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Doha', 'Deir ez-Zor', 'Damascus', 'Tehran', 'Mecca', 'United States', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Qatar', 'Iran']",Declassified: The Sino-Russian Masterplan To End U.S. Dominance In Middle East | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Declassified-The-Sino-Russian-Masterplan-To-End-US-Dominance-In-The-Middle-Ea.html,None,
11402805,2019-06-02,"President Trump decided to open up yet another front in his trade war, this time turning his sights on Mexico.

Trump took to twitter on Thursday to announce a 5 percent tariff on all goods coming from Mexico would take effect on June 10. The tariff would then rise by 5 percent each month until Mexico cut off illegal immigration, with tariffs topping out at 25 percent by October. Trump said the tariffs come in response to illegal immigration.

Administration officials said that they would ""judge success"" on a ""day-to-day, week-to-week basis,"" offering only subjective criteria such as cutting the flow of migration ""substantially.""

In an earlier era, the announcement could be interpreted as a tough-talking negotiating tactic, but after Trump abruptly announced a hike of tariffs on China a few weeks ago, the markets are now taking him at his word. Financial markets were rattled on Friday, with stocks and bonds gyrating on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 300 points.

The U.S. and the Mexican economies are very much intertwined, and the tariffs would be acutely felt by American consumers. The tariffs would also batter the auto industry, which has supply chains spread across North America. The global auto industry is already suffering from weak sales and job cuts. GM and Ford saw their share prices sink by more than 3 percent in early trading on Friday.

Complicating matters further, the tariffs would severely diminish the odds that the renegotiated NAFTA agreement, known as the USMCA, would be ratified. The three countries agreed to the treaty last year, but it needs to be ratified in all three national legislatures.

The tariffs come at a particularly bad time. Fears about slowing global growth are rising, with signs of an economic slowdown mounting. The U.S.-China trade war, which only seems to be escalating, is dragging down growth. Morgan Stanley said that the U.S. economy is on ""recession watch.""

Crude oil was already heading for the largest monthly decline in six months. Trump made sure that oil benchmarks closed out the month of May on a negative note. In early trading on Friday, WTI and Brent were each off more than 2 percent, with WTI back in the mid-$50s and Brent plunging to the low $60s.

The tariffs would impact an energy trade flow from Mexico to the U.S. that last year reached $13 billion, according to Argus Media, including 665,000 bpd of crude oil and 53,500 bpd of refined products imports.

It's unclear how Mexico will respond, but could simply enact retaliatory tariffs, as China has done. Mexico imported $265 billion worth of goods in 2018, including $34 billion of crude and petroleum products and $18 billion of plastics, according to Argus.

A new U.S.-Mexico trade war would drag down an oil market that was already heading in a negative direction. ""Oil prices have weakened on rising fears that protectionist trade policies will reduce demand, and following a month of consistent speculative net selling,"" Standard Chartered wrote in a note. ""Data has been weak across the board, from bottom-up oil-market data through to top-down macroeconomic indicators.""

The investment bank went on: ""The latest global oil demand readings have also been negative.

We estimate that global demand fell y/y in March, with weak demand across the OECD and a particularly marked slump in Europe.""

While supply outages have hit Venezuela and Iran, and potentially Libya, the trade war could affect the entire global economy. As such, the downside risks to oil from weak demand are of greater significance than the upside risk from supply outages, according to Standard Chartered.

However, at the same time, the low prices likely ensure that OPEC+ will extend the production cuts for the rest of the year. They will also put the squeeze on U.S. shale drillers. ""[W]e think prices are low enough to both delay and moderate increases in Saudi Arabia's output, and will also increase financial pressure on US oil companies to scale back activity even further,"" Standard Chartered concluded.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Mexico', 'China', 'Venezuela', 'Libya', 'Iran']",Trump's Multi-Front War That Spooks Oil Markets | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Trumps-Multi-Front-War-That-Spooks-Oil-Markets.html,None,

Murphy Oil will exit Malaysia after 20 years after it signed a deal with a subsidiary of PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited to sell its two primary Malaysian subsidiaries for US$2.127 billion in cash, payable upon closing and subject to customary closing adjustments, the U.S. firm said on Thursday.

Murphy Oil will use the proceeds to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks and to cut debt, while it will be focusing primarily on the Eagle Ford shale play and on its operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

A total of US$750 million of the remaining proceeds will be ""earmarked for U.S. oil-weighted opportunities through potential acquisitions and/or the funding of both deep water projects and U.S. onshore opportunities,"" the company said.

""We will continue with our plans of investing in our high margin, oil-weighted Western Hemisphere opportunities, especially the Eagle Ford Shale and the Gulf of Mexico while maintaining our focused low-cost exploration program,"" said Roger W. Jenkins, President and CEO.

Last month, Marathon Oil said that it would be exiting the UK North Sea as it continues to focus on high-return U.S. shale oil operations. Houston-based Marathon Oil has signed an agreement with independent UK company RockRose Energy to sell its UK businesses, which held interests in several fields in the UK part of the North Sea.

11402820,2019-08-12,"The gold bears have finally caved under the deafening barrage of fiscal and geopolitical catalysts, from Fed hints to intensely brewing conflict with Iran. But there is one key trend that stands to push gold up beyond $1,700--regardless of the day's news.

Of course, it's difficult for the bears to ignore a nearly $50/ounce gain for gold, which is now trading well above its 5-year high.

Not only has the U.S.-Iran conflict reached a boiling point, with Trump readying to deploy an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East, but the European Central Bank has issued a defiant, dovish tone, saying it won't hesitate to provide further stimulus: That means rate cuts.

The icing on the gold cake is the US Fed, which has now clearly indicated that it hasn't abandoned the idea of rate cuts for 2019.

But in this perfect storm for gold prices, EuroSun Mining (TSE:ESM, OTCMKTS:CPNFF) CEO Scott Moore says we're overlooking a significant trend that will outlast the current geopolitical meltdown and even the Fed's policies: It's a global push for de-dollarization.

""Government's around the world are becoming increasingly wary of the dollar's hegemony in international trade,"" says Moore. ""And they're doing their best to distance themselves from it by using their gold reserves to buy more gold instead.""

This process is already underway mainly in nations with strong anti-U.S. sentiment including Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, Turkey, Qatar, India, Pakistan, Libya, Egypt and the Philippines among others.

Naturally, these countries are turning to gold since the yellow metal is not under lock-and-key like the greenback and other electronic payment methods.

This trend is abundantly clear when you look at central banks' buying activity.

According to the World Gold Council, central banks purchased nearly 70 percent more gold during the first quarter of the year than they did during the previous year's corresponding period.

That's the most they bought since the first quarter of 2013.

For EuroSun's Rovina Valley project in Romania--the largest in-development gold mine in Europe--the de-dollarization drive will been a boon for the 10 million ounces of gold equivalent they're hoping to get out of the ground in the simple geography of Romania's prolific Tethyan Gold Belt.

There are plenty of billionaire fund managers who think today's 'crazy' gold prices are just getting started.

Not least among them is Paul Tudor Jones, who says that gold ""has everything going for it"", and sees it pushing to $1,700 an ounce ""rather quickly"", as he noted in an interview with Bloomberg.

And this is all just thanks to near-term trends wrapped up in the Fed and wild geopolitics.

We're interested instead in the long-term trend that is says gold will be a major winner of the global de-dollarization trend.

There's nothing like a sanctions frenzy to create a major uptick in momentum here.

Most notably, Russia and China have pledged to accelerate their de-dollarization strategies because of Trump's sanctions push. And they've reached a deal to use national currencies for bilateral trade. No more U.S. dollar, then.

So, we're carefully watching what the central banks are doing.

The latest countries to jump on the de-dollarization bandwagon are Serbia and the Philippines. Serbia is boosting its national gold reserves, increasing them from 20 to 30 tons by the end of this year. It's shooting for 50 tons by the end of 2020.

Tudor is watching these developments closely, and to him, it suggests an unprecedented shift:

""Remember we've had 75 years of expanding globalization and trade, and we built the machine around the belief that's the way the world's going to be. Now all of a sudden it's stopped, and we are reversing that,"" he told Bloomberg.

""When you break something like that, the consequences won't be seen at first, it might be seen one year, two years, three years later. That would make one think that it's possible that we go into a recession. That would make one think that rates in the US go back toward the zero bound and in the course of that situation, gold is going to scream. ""

EuroSun's (TSE:ESM, OTCMKTS:CPNFF) Moore agrees: ""What's happening with Iran right now will only further the de-dollarization push. The dollar isn't necessarily king anymore, and gold is more than ready to resume its rightful place on the safe haven throne.""

Five gold companies to watch as more countries push for de-dollarization:

Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY) (TSE:YRI)

Yamana, has recently completed its Cerro Moro project in Argentina, giving its investors something major to look out for. The company plans to ramp up its gold production by 20% through 2019 and its silver production by a whopping 200%. Investors can expect a serious increase in free cash flow if precious metal prices remain stable.

Recently, Yamana signed an agreement with Glencore and Goldcorp to develop and operate another Argentinian project, the Agua Rica. Initial analysis suggests the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236,000 tonnes (520 million pounds) of copper-equivalent metal, including the contributions of gold, molybdenum, and silver, for the first 10 years of operation.

The agreement is a major step forward for the Agua Rica region, and all of the miners working on it.

Eldorado Gold Corp. (NYSE:EGO) (TSE:ELD)

This Canadian mid-cap miner has assets in Europe and Brazil and has managed to cut cost per ounce significantly in recent years. Though its share price isn't as high as it once was, Eldorado is well positioned to make significant advancements in the near-term.

In 2018, Eldorado produced over 349,000 ounces of gold, well above its previous expectations, and is set to boost production even further in 2019. Additionally, Eldorado is planning increased cash flow and revenue growth this year.

Eldorado's President and CEO, George Burns, stated: ""As a result of the team's hard work in 2018, we are well positioned to grow annual gold production to over 500,000 ounces in 2020. We expect this will allow us to generate significant free cash flow and provide us with the opportunity to consider debt retirement later this year. ""

Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) (TSE:ABX) and Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE:GG):

All eyes are on the billion-dollar partnership these two giants are forming in Chile's gold belt. Goldcorp is putting up $1 billion to get in on this deal as miners scramble for new sources of growth. This joint venture will see the two giant miners operate three properties in Chile's Maricunga region, and these will be major catalysts for both.

Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) Founded over 100 years ago, Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is one of the leading mining companies in the world. The company holds assets in Peru, Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, and around the United States. Primarily focusing on gold and copper, Newmont has steadily carved out a name for itself among those in the industry. In Q1 2017 alone, the company secured over 1.2M ounces of gold. Definitely noteworthy for investors.

Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) (TSE:WPM)

Wheaton is a company with its hands in operations all around the world. As one of the largest 'streaming' companies on the planet, Wheaton has agreements with 19 operating mines and 9 projects still in development. Its unique business model allows it to leverage price increases in the precious metals sector, as well as provide a quality dividend yield for its investors.

Recently, Wheaton sealed a deal with Hudbay Minerals Inc. relating to its Rosemont project. For an initial payment of $230 million, Wheaton is entited to 100 percent of payable gold and silver at a price of $450 per ounce and $3.90 per ounce respectively.

Randy Smallwood, Wheaton's President and Chief Executive Officer explained, ""With their most recent successful construction of the Constancia mine in Peru, the Hudbay team has proven themselves to be strong and responsible mine developers, and we are excited about the same team moving this project into production. Rosemont is an ideal fit for Wheaton's portfolio of high-quality assets, and when it is in production, should add well over fifty thousand gold equivalent ounces to our already growing production profile.""

Centerra Gold Inc. (OTCMKTS: CAGDF) (TSE:CG)

Centerra Gold is a Canada-based gold miner with flagship assets, the Mount Milligan Mine and the Kumtor Mine which are located in Canada and the Kyrgyz Republic respectively. It also owns the Öksüt Gold Mine in Turkey, making it the single-largest North American gold company operating in Asia, with over 22 years of experience in the region.

Centerra's biggest selling points, however, are its strong balance sheets. For 2018, the company reported over $100 million in net earnings, generating over $217 million from cash operations, exceeding many analyst's expectations.

Scott Perry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Centerra stated, ""As a result of the strong fourth quarter operating performance at both operations, the Company exceeded its overall 2018 production and cost guidance producing 729,556 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost on a by-product basis of $754 per ounce sold, beating the low-end of our all-in-sustaining cost guidance for the year.

11402821,2019-07-26,"- In the first quarter, an EIA survey of 43 U.S. oil producers finds a deterioration in cash flow of a combined $1.2 billion compared to the first quarter in 2018. Much of that can be pinned on the $8-per-barrel decline in prices over that time period.

- Notably, aside from mostly breaking even in the middle of 2018, the 43 companies have been cash flow negative for years.

- But year-on-year cash flow had been steadily improving since 2016...until the first quarter of this year.

- Liquids production from the 43 companies jumped by 0.7 mb/d in the first quarter and capex declined by $0.3 billion.

- The shale industry, under pressure from shareholders over the last year or two, has begun to prioritize shareholder payouts. The 43 companies spent $4 billion on shareholder distributions in the first quarter, or 31 percent of cash flow from operations. In 2018, the companies had only spent an average of 28 percent.

- Drilling in the Permian basin is putting stress on the region's scarce water reserves.

- The median water use per well used in oil drilling in the Permian surged from 2 million gallons to over 11 million gallons between 2012 and 2016, according to the Wall Street Journal.

- Drillers spend between 50 to 75 cents per barrel of water, according to Bluefield Research, which translates to about $200,000 per well.

- The shale industry spent over $13 billion on water in 2018, with 54 percent of that concentrated in the Permian. That total is expected to surge to $54 billion over the next decade.

- Iron ore prices had been on the rise this year, but they have ""switched to correction mode,"" according to Commerzbank.

- Prices had hit a multi-year high of $120 per ton earlier this month, close to a record high, but prices have fallen by about $10 since then.

- Part of the reason is that Brazil's iron ore giant, Vale, is hoping to restart production at some of its mines, which were shut down following disasters earlier this year.

- S&P Global Platts sees a supply deficit for seaborne trade this year of about 54 million metric tons this year, and it could take three years for the deficit to clear.

- Commerzbank is more bearish, pointing to weak demand for steel in China. ""In our opinion, there is no fundamental justification for the still high iron ore prices. We expect a further significant correction,"" Commerzbank said in a note. ""The sharply falling forward curve suggests a price of below $100 at the end of 2019 and even of below $80 by the end of 2020.""

- Coal is getting slammed in Europe on two fronts - cheap natural gas and record high prices for carbon.

- Carbon prices are trading near 30 euros, surpassing the previous record set in 2008. Record high temperatures are also adding a bit of seasonal jolt to electricity markets.

- ""The latest heatwave in Europe is boosting the upswing because it increases electricity consumption, yet nuclear power production in France is having to be reduced in some places because temperatures in the rivers are too high,"" Commerzbank said.

- However, natural gas prices have plunged worldwide amid a glut.

- The end result is a rapid deterioration of coal's position in Europe. Coal use fell by 40 percent across Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal and the UK in the first six months of this year.

- ""The exit from coal is finally driven by the market,"" Claudia Kemfert, a professor of energy economics at the DIW research institute in Berlin, told Bloomberg. ""The repair of emissions trading has worked.""

- As the earnings season gets underway, the U.S. shale sector has been hit hard by waning investor interest. ""We expect the tone of the reports to be downbeat; we think that the average company guidance on future activity is likely be revised lower,"" Standard Chartered wrote in a note.

- Drilling activity has slowed significantly. Standard Chartered said that drilling may not rebound until WTI rises to $66 per barrel, ""which is above the surveyed companies' price expectation over the next two years.""

- But the largest oil and gas companies are doing much better than the smallest. ""We calculate that an output-weighted basket of small company equities (less than 20 thousand barrels per day, kb/d) has lost 66% of its value since the start of 2018,"" Standard Chartered found. Meanwhile, medium-sized companies with production between 20,000 and 70,000 bpd saw their shares lose 54 percent of their value. The largest only lost 28 percent.

- ""With the outlook soured by unexpected technical and geological challenges in key regions, low oil prices, and even weaker natural gas prices, we expect oil and gas activity and q/q shale oil output growth to remain muted in H2-2019,"" the investment bank concluded.

- Despite soaring demand for lithium in electric vehicles, prices are down as supply continues to grow.

- In late 2017, lithium carbonate prices peaked at $25,800 per ton, according to Roskill.

- But from there, prices fell throughout 2018 and into the start of this year, dipping to $11,500 in February 2019.

- A few years ago, analysts worried about constrained supplies, but production has ramped up in China, Australia, Chile and Canada.

- Roskill says Chinese supply has played a critical role in driving down prices. In 2018, ""Chinese battery grade lithium carbonate prices fell from US$21,700/t in Q2 to US$11,450/t in Q4, as increased production from domestic brine operations, albeit of poor-quality materials, alleviated tight supply in the Chinese market,"" Roskill said in a report.

- But demand is still rising and more supply will be needed in the years ahead. Demand is expected to increase five-fold over the next decade.

- The U.S. has become the fifth largest oil exporter in the world after Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq and Canada. The U.S. has averaged 2.8 mb/d of oil exports this year, up from less than 0.5 mb/d prior to 2016.

- Despite the lightness of oil from U.S. shale, exports continue to rise.

- The UK and the Netherlands have also purchased cargoes this year, but in the Mediterranean, U.S. crude is less competitive given light supplies from Libya, Algeria and Azerbaijan. ""Also, due to lack of deepwater ports in the region, VLCC shipping economics are less favourable,"" the IEA said earlier this month.

- China emerged as a top buyer in 2017, but those purchases fell sharply late last year as the U.S.-China trade war ensued, although shipments resumed a bit in April.

- Nevertheless, the U.S. kept oil exports to Asia aloft, finding new markets in India, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'France', 'China', 'Brazil', 'Berlin', 'Portugal', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'Chile', 'Canada', 'Australia']",U.S. Shale Continues To Struggle | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Shale-Continues-To-Struggle.html,None,
11402823,2019-07-22,"Libya has lifted its force majeure on Monday after it stopped loading crude oil for the weekend from the Zawiya terminal following the suspension of production from the country's largest field, Sharara, on Friday.

""This is the result of an unlawful Sharara pipeline valve closure by an unidentified group between Hamada and the Zawiya port (on Friday evening), resulting in production being suspended,"" a statement by the National Oil Corporation, as quoted by AFP, read.

Sharara was shut down Friday, according to a Reuters report, because of a suspected valve closure on the pipeline carrying crude from the field to Zawiya. Before the closure, the field was pumping about 290,000 bpd. The closure, a NOC official told Reuters, would reduce Libya's total production to a little over 1 million bpd. This is quite an improvement over production rates from December last year, when the country's total production was about 1 million bpd including Sharara's contribution.

The field is a favourite target for militants due to its size: it has a production capacity of as much as 340,000 bpd. The latest prolonged shutdown began in December when NOC declared a force majeure on Sharara following the occupation of the field by local groups demanding better living conditions and power supply security.

Related: U.S. Shale Is Doomed No Matter What They Do

The force majeure was only lifted in early March this year, having cost the National Oil Corporations some 20,000 bpd in lost capacity due to vandalism, creating a lots of US$1.8 million.

""Deliberate attempts to sabotage pipelines and production hurt both national oil revenues and critical power supply for everyday Libyans,"" NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla said commenting on the latest shutdown of Sharara, highlighting once again the crucial importance of oil revenues for the North African country.

At the moment, Libya is in the throes of yet another major clash between pro-government forces and the Libyan National Army: a group affiliated with the eastern Libyan government, which is not recognized by the UN and supported by the United States. The LNA had complete control of the oil terminals on the Oil Crescent and has repeatedly clashed with other claimants of the key infrastructure. The group worked together with the UN-recognized NOC to get the country's oil industry going again after the end of the civil war, but has now changed its priorities to removing the Government of National Accord from its seat in Tripoli.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Zawiya, Libya', 'Libya', 'United States']",Libya Lifts Force Majeure After Elephant Field Starts Pumping Again | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libya-Lifts-Force-Majeure-After-Elephant-Field-Starts-Pumping-Again.html,None,
11402824,2019-05-26,"A slight price recovery on Friday couldn't save what turned out to be the worst week this year for oil markets.

Brent is currently hovering around $68 per barrel having fallen from a $74 high earlier this year. Increased worries about a possible oil slump, due to the perceived negative impact of the escalating US trade war with China, and unexpected higher stock volumes, have scared mainstream analysts it seems. It seems that the oil market is not being ruled by bulls or bears, but is being sheepish instead.

The combination of a perceived global economic slowdown, higher levels of US oil storage, and rumors of a possible de-escalation of the Iran-US crisis are mitigating the clear and present danger in oil and gas markets. Without a doubt, OPEC+ will be rolling over its ongoing production cut agreement, as the oil cartel and its Russian partner are content with higher crude oil prices and strong demand. The positive effects of US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, which removed vast volumes of crude from the market, has been a godsend for OPEC+. Trump's dream of US energy independence is no longer working against OPEC+. The current market situation only emphasizes the power of OPEC+ on the global market. Trumps' strategy, and the increased geopolitical risk that it brings in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, has already been taken into account by the market. It is other developments, such as increased political instability in Algeria, a potential breakdown or blockade by Libyan general Haftar's forces of Libya's oil production and increased heat in the East Mediterranean, that may well prove to be a game changer for global oil markets.

US crude inventories, reportedly at their highest level since July 2017, are having an oversized impact on today's oil market. At the same time, growing fears about the US-China trade war have caused analysts to brace for a slowdown in crude oil demand in the coming months. Both these factors, the trade war and US inventories, are not as serious as the media is making them out to be. The ongoing US-China trade wars is unlikely to become a full showdown. Neither party is willing to risk a full-blown crisis as the results will hit both severely. When looking at China's options, Beijing will not be willing to risks a situation in which, for the first time ever, the Politburo has to acknowledge that their 5-year planning is not reaching its set growth targets. Beijing will do whatever it takes to get the figures adjusted to quell a possible economic crisis.

At the same time, Trump will not want to risk lower economic growth figures or even a full-scale slump as it would negatively impact his reelection prospects. Don't forget, Trump's presidency is almost in its last year, the coming 12-18 months will be targeting positive economic and financial figures to support reelection. The fall-out of a China trade war will mostly hit the US states that are full of Trump supporters.

When looking at crude oil markets, the situation on the ground is a clearly pro-OPEC. The speculation about a possible end to the OPEC+ production cuts is largely unfounded. Saudi Arabia, Russia and several other major producers are content with the current situation. At the same time, US storage volumes are unrepresentative, as increases are supported by the lack of demand for US shale oil. As some have clearly stated, there is a crisis looming due to crude quality issues. With outages in Venezuela and Iran and instability in Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Algeria, volumes of a certain quality of oil have fallen dramatically. US shale oil should not be considered a savior or swing producer, as it cannot fill the gaps in the current market. Furthermore, Iranian volumes are no longer attractive to its former clients. China, India and even Turkey, are reducing their intake of Iranian crude. Some of crude from Tehran will still enter the market, but not enough.

The market is set for a recovery in the coming weeks, especially if markets continue to overreact to the downside. At the same time, geopolitical risks are much higher than the market wants to admit. A possible proxy-war in the Middle East is a real possibility, with Iraq or Yemen as possible targets. A new confrontation would remove the current ceiling of $75 per barrel with a bang.

The total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs fell by 3 according to the report with the number of active oil rigs gaining 2 to reach 833 and the number of gas rigs falling 5 to reach 189.

The oil and gas rig count is now just 14 up from this time last year, with oil seeing just a 18-rig increase year on year, gas rigs down on the year by 3, and miscellaneous rigs seeing a 1-rig decrease for the year.

Oil prices were trading significantly up earlier on Friday leading up to the data release as bullish factors excited the market after a massive shakeup deal between Chevron and Exxon was announced, and on tightening supply signals from Libya, Algeria, and Venezuela.

WTI was trading up $0.60 (+0.94%) at $64.18 -- inching closer to $70 per barrel that some analysts predict would hurt demand. The Brent benchmark was trading up $0.67 (+0.95%) at $71.50 at 12:22pm EST, comfortably over the $70 threshold. Prices for both represent a significant gain week on week.

US crude oil production for week ending April 5 was 12.2 million barrels for the second week in a row.

Canada, too, saw a decline in the number of active rigs this week. Canada's total oil and gas rig count fell by 2 after falling by 20 last week, and is now just 66, which is 36 fewer rigs than this time last year as Canada's oil industry continues to face steep uphill battles over its constrained pipeline capacity that is necessary to get its heavy crude to market along with production caps instituted to keep Western Canadian Select prices from falling further.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Venezuela', 'Libya', 'Algeria', 'Canada']",Decline In U.S. Oil Rigs Sends WTI Higher | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Decline-In-US-Oil-Rigs-Sends-WTI-Higher.html,None,
11402826,2019-04-11,"The removal of long-time Sudanese dictator Omar Bashir by the Sudanese army has been hailed by some as a sign of a new ""Arab Spring"".

From a Western point of view, the removal of president Bashir of Sudan, after several weeks of mass protests in Khartoum and other cities, is in line with the exit of Algeria's long-time leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Optimism in the press, especially in the West, over both developments seem to be based on emotions and not on facts. As the Arab Spring has shown, don't ever count out the existing power structures of the respective regimes, and specifically the armed forces. The Egyptian revolution was the first example, shortly after the 'democratic revolution' the military took over and reinstated the status quo.

The sudden intervention by the Sudanese forces, led by Sudanese defense minister, Awad Ibn Auf, to remove President Bashir from office is again fully in line with the Egyptian and Algerian examples. So-called democratic protests on the street have culminated in a showdown. Internal assessments by the Sudanese armed forces, and security forces have shown that the position of Bashir was unsustainable. International pressure and internal dissent have totally undermined the position of the Bashir clan, and Arab states didn't bother to rescue the embattled dictator. These assessments have not been made in the Western press, as Europeans and Americans always seem to focus on the narrative of protesters chanting for freedom.

The facts on the ground are different. The current developments could well be qualified as a second ""Arab Spring"", as it follows the same political and security story that we have seen before. President Bashir has been removed from office without a military confrontation between the Sudanese armed forces and the militant supporters of Bashir, the Janjaweed. While protestors were chanting their slogans, dreaming about real regime change and open elections, the ruling regime has been able to stabilize its own position again. The potential of a significant crackdown is undeniable, as the armed forces and some parts of the former Bashir regime will need to destabilize opposition and remove the crowds from the streets. If protests continue, security forces might change course and remove protestors by force. As opposed to Egypt, Libya and Algeria, Sudan does not have a real opposition block that could challenge the current power structures. This is something that many Western decision makers also underestimate. The masses in the streets don't represent a democratic pro-western opposition block, but are rather a gathering of individuals protesting against a general authoritarian regime.

The move by the Sudanese army to remove Bashir and quell the protests at the same time does not bode well for the revolutionaries. A real change should not to be expected, and a violent confrontation between the army and Janjaweed is not to the advantage of any party. It seems very unlikely that the end of the Bashir era will be a victory for the people.

Protests are likely to be hamstrung even further by the armed forces implementing martial law. Some officers have already said that their rule will be in place for at least the next two years. If in this period no outside powers intervene, the new ruling group, supported by the army and possibly the Janjaweed militia, will consolidate their power for sure.

Still, some sort of change can be expected. Increased instability at a time of growing conflict in the region is likely to have a supra-regional effect. Analysts are worried that the unrest in Sudan will spill over and affect the Horn of Africa - although it must be said that there is no threat of intervention by the Sudanese army at present. More worryingly, a destabilized and weakened Sudan may tempt regional powers such as Turkey, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar to gain an advantage in the area. All have become very active in the region, setting up military bases and investing in the Horn of Africa, Sudan and South Sudan. Iran is another player that can't be ignored, even though the Islamic Republic was thrown out of Sudan in 2016. The West is worried that a new military regime could cause a reversion back to the Sudan of the 1990s, when the country was a major hub for extremists such as GIA (Algeria), Hamas and Hezbollah, all supported by Iranian and Chinese military advisors.

The implosion of Sudan or a destabilized Horn of Africa is a doomsday scenario for most. It will not only put its already fragile relationship with Egypt, its northern neighbor, at risk, it will also negatively affect the future of South Sudan's oil industry. Sudan exports its crude via a joint Sudan-South Sudan pipeline and a blockade of that route will, undoubtedly, lead to turmoil in South Sudan. Unrest in Sudan (and South Sudan) will not have a major impact on global oil supplies, but it will present an imminent danger to global commodity flows. Sudan's long and important coast line on the Red Sea indirectly puts Egypt, Saudi Arabia and many others on alert. If stability doesn't return to Khartoum, the Horn of Africa (Bab El Mandab) also will feel the negative repercussions of regional uncertainty. Commodity traders and shippers should be keeping a wary eye on the region. While South Sudan is only producing around 170,000 bpd of crude, a blockade at a time of already wavering global supply could be enough to push prices up further.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Sudan', 'Egypt', 'Algeria', 'Khartoum', 'Libya', 'Turkey', 'South Sudan', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Qatar', 'Iran', 'United Arab Emirates']",The Next Geopolitical Flashpoint For Oil | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Next-Geopolitical-Flashpoint-For-Oil.html,None,
11402827,2019-03-05,"Libya's largest oil field, Sharara, is back in operation after almost three months of suspension, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation.

The field was originally closed for production in December, when clashes between militant groups forced the National Oil Corporation of Libya to institute a force majeure, which was only lifted yesterday.

The groups that occupied Sharara in early December with demands for better economic conditions and power supply security. The occupation lasted until early February, when the Libyan National Army, a group affiliated with the eastern Libyan government, took control of the field. The force majeure remained in place as the NOC refused to yield to demands for payments, arguing this would set a dangerous precedent.

Then, however, the LNA faced the Petroleum Facilities Guard, an old adversary and a group loyal to the UN-recognized Libyan government. The situation was resolved only last week with mediation from the United Arab Emirates.

According to NOC's chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, the three-month blockade of the field had cost it US$1.8 million and 20,000 bpd in lost production capacity as a result of vandalism and looting.

In a statement, the state oil company said the venture operating the field had ""received written assurance from the officials from the Libya National Army ""that all individuals subject to Public Prosecutor arrest warrant have been removed from the field and will not be readmitted to the site. Additional security measures for on-site staff are being implemented, with perimeter security and safe ""green zones"" a priority,""

Sharara has the capacity to pump 340,000 bpd, which is about a third of Libya's total oil production when the field is in operation. This importance of Sharara has made it a frequent target for various groups and their grievances and ambitions, turning Libya into a swing producer despite its relatively low production rate of just above 1 million bpd before the latest Sharara outage.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'United Arab Emirates']",Libya's Largest Oilfield Restarts After 3-Months Of Suspension | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyas-Largest-Oilfield-Restarts-After-3-Months-Of-Suspension.html,None,
11402854,2019-07-03,"The new OPEC/OPEC+ production cut agreement is now a confirmed fact, the world's leading crude producers (the United States excepting) have agreed to prolong the supply coordination mechanism that has been in place since November 2017 for a further 9 months, up until March 2020. The extent of the cut remains the same, i.e. 1.2mbpd, essentially meaning a rollover of the status quo for the upcoming months. The news stopped short of invigorating the markets, in fact, crude prices slipped $2 per barrel day-on-day on Tuesday, on worries that demand might actually slow down to such an extent that it might render the OPEC+ supply cuts irrelevant.

In addition, disagreements between Saudi Arabia and Russia on the fundamentals of the required global inventory levels have somewhat marred the long-term prospects of the OPEC+ charter. Wednesday saw an uptick in crude levels largely attributable to US crude inventories, yet it still remains to be seen whether the anticipated OPEC-induced price rebound will take place. As of Wednesday afternoon, global benchmark Brent traded at $63 per barrel, whilst WTI was assessed at $56.6-56.8 per barrel.

- The Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA is restarting its PetroPiar blending facilities, jointly operated with US oil and gas major Chevron.

- With the US market blocked for synthetic crude previously produced at PetroPiar, PDVSA is now seeking to configurate the blending to receive 16° API Merey as the end result.

- Merey has become the key crude export stream for Venezuela, with regular exports to Jamnagar in India, Shuidong, Zhanjiang and Ningbo in China and Singapore.

- For that end, PDVSA will blend 8-10° API Orinoco heavy bitumenous crude with the light Santa Barbara (39-40° API, 1 percent Sulphur), resulting in some 170kbpd of Merey to be exported.

- This puts Chevron in a difficult position as it has to withdraw from Venezuela by July 27, 2019 if it wishes to comply with US sanctions, unless it manages to obtain a waivers.

2. Saudi Arabia Makes Sure South Korea Runs Saudi Crude

- Wrapping up an intensive charm offensive campaign, Saudi Aramco concluded a 20-year term supply contract with South Korean refiner Hyundai Oilbank, starting January 2020.

- Under the contract Aramco would supply 150kbpd of Saudi crude and 100kbpd of non-Saudi crude on a monthly basis via its trading arm, Saudi Aramco Trading.

- The previous term supply contract Hyundai Oilbank had with Aramco stipulated a 40kbpd purchase level.

- This marks a qualitative shift in Aramco's ties to the Korean refiner following the Saudi's recent acquisition of a 17 percent stake in Oilbank, estimated at $1.2-1.3 billion.

- Concurrently, Oilbank agreed to a 20-year contract product supply deal that would see it supply 60kbpd of products to Aramco Trading, primarily jet fuel on Singapore prices.

- Saudi Aramco also clinched a deal with national oil company KNOC on leasing its unused storage space, in addition to ongoing leases in Okinawa, Japan and Zhoushan, China.

- Following months of predominantly upward movement, the official selling prices of the Libyan national oil company for July-loading cargoes witnessed an across-the-board drop.

- Libya's largest exports stream Es Sider was cut 10 cents per barrel month-on-month to a -$0.55 discount to Dated, whilst the second-largest Esharara was dropped 35 cents m-o-m (to a -$0.3 discount).

- The Libyan price drop is fully in line with FSU/Middle East light sweet crude slumps, bringing down the value of CPC, Azeri Light and fellow Maghreb-based crude Saharan Blend.

- Libya's only sour crudes, Al Jurf and Bouri, webre kept unchanged from June as their pricing basis is Urals Med, making them much more receptive to overall trends in the Mediterranean.

- This week saw a new international flareup as forces loyal to Field Marshal Haftar destroyed a Turkish drone parked at Tripoli airport, stoking fears of a renewed battlefield conflagration.

- An LNA spokesman declared that Turkish assets in and around Libya, including oil tankers (one such, the Emek S, is nearing Brega), are ""legitimate targets"".

4. Algeria Drop July OSPs Amid Weak Mediterranean Market

- The Algerian national oil company Sonatrach has cut its official selling price for July-loading Saharan Blend cargoes to an unorthodox $0.01 per barrel premium to Dated Brent, down 79 cents month-on-month.

- The July Saharan Blend prices are retroactive as all the cargoes have been already sold, interestingly however spot prices of the Algerian flagship grade have been assessed at a $0.75-0.80 per barrel discount to Brent.

- With Urals prices plummeting this June to a $2 per barrel discount to Dated, Mediterranean-traded light sweet cargoes, Saharan Blend and its closest competitor CPC have gone the same way downward.

- The burned-down 335kbpd Pennsylvania Refinery was a regular buyer of Saharan Blend (18 vessels in 2018, a mere 3 in 2019 though), trader ENI will have to find a new market outlet for those volumes.

- France remains the largest market for Algerian crude 2019 YTD with 108kbpd, followed by the United States (99kbpd) and the United Kingdom (85kbpd).

- Kazakhstan's largest producing oil field was shook by a sudden outburst of clashes between domestic Kazakh workers and foreign subcontractors, apparently provoked by the culturally insensitive treatment of a local lady by a male worker from Libya.

- The Chevron-led Tengiz Future Growth expansion project became the scene of mass-scale beatings, leaving behind more than 40 people injured, with all Jordanian and Lebanese nationals evacuated from the site.

- One of the main thrusts of the Tengiz riots were demands for fairer treatment of domestic workers, easing of excessively strict work rules and amelioration of working conditions.

- All work on the Future Growth project was halted, however exports of CPC (of which Tengiz is the major part) were heretofore undisturbed.

- Tengiz produced 0.63mbpd in 2018 (28.6 million tons) - its output should increase to 0.9mbpd once the Future Growth expansion project is commissioned.

- Angolan national oil company Sonangol has set its sights on building a refining complex in Mosul, located in Iraq's troublesome North next to the Kurdish border.

- In response to the Iraqi Oil Ministry's tender to build a refinery in the Gyarah region of Mosul, Sonangol is proposing a 100-150kbpd capacity.

- Sonangol is operating the 30kbpd Qayara oil field that was taken over by Islamic State militants in 2014, axing the Angolan major's plans to reach 120kbpd peak production by end 2010s.

- The Qayara crude is extremely heavy by Iraqi standards, within the 15-18 API degree range, necessitating a deep conversion technology for the site.

- The irony of the situation is that Angola's (relatively unsophisticated) refineries will be built/modernized not by Sonangol but by the Italian ENI and the Hong Kong-based United Shine consortium.

- The oil major Equinor clinched a deal with the Austrian OMV over the development of the Wisting field, one of the northernmost and most challenging fields of the Arctic.

- Equinor would take over the development of 440 MMbbl Wisting until the field is brought onstream, then handing it back over to OMV.

- Wisting presents a multitude of challenges - it is more than 300km from the continent in icy waters with little to none sunshine throughout the year.

- The field's geological structure is demanding, too, as the shallowness of the reservoir (crust a mere 250m below seabed) and low pressure levels makes it susceptible for crude leaking to the seabed.

- With much of Norway's political elite now making a stand against drilling in the Arctic, buttressed by the somewhat botched history of Goliat, OMV delegated the politically difficult part to its Norwegian partner.

The Sarir field, operated by NOC's subsidiary Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), is Libya's largest oilfield with proven reserves of 4.8 billion barrels, according to the national oil company.

Current oil production at the Sarir oil field is around 155,000 bpd.

The fire started at the power station at the field and cut off electricity to parts of it, NOC said, adding that ""An internal investigation is underway to determine the cause of the temperature rise and an estimated restart date post repair works.""

Yet, some operations at the field that had been suspended since May due to a technical issue have recently restarted, NOC said.

The technical difficulties at the field highlight the fragile state of the Libyan oil industry now that fighting between rival armies continues in and near the capital, Tripoli.

While the oil market is fixated on the U.S.-China trade war for signs of demand, and on Iran, Venezuela, and the Middle East for signs of more supply disruptions, investors have not fully priced in the increased risk that Libya's fighting could result in a serious oil supply outage, analysts say.

The security situation in Libya has materially worsened this spring after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar ordered in early April his Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on the capital Tripoli. The self-styled army has been clashing with troops of the UN-backed government in a renewed confrontation that could escalate and threaten to disrupt, once again, Libya's oil production and exports.

""Protracted hostilities continue to hamper NOC operations and our ability to serve the Libyan people. Key infrastructure is being damaged and security eroded - allowing criminal elements to prosper,"" NOC's chairman Sanalla said in a statement last month.

11402857,2019-02-25,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) -- Libya's state-run National Oil Corp refused to restart the country's biggest field after militants seized and declared it secure earlier this month.

The standoff over Sharara, which can pump about 300,000 bopd, is entering its third month. NOC won't resume production while armed groups are there, the company's chairman Mustafa Sanalla said on Sunday. The Libyan National Army, loyal to eastern leader Khalifa Haftar, controls the field and said it's ready to restart.

""The circumstances that made us declare force majeure still exist now and therefore we can't lift the ban,"" Sanalla said, referring to a legal clause protecting a party from liability if it can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control. The ""reality is the field is still not safe.""

Libya, one of the most volatile and politically fragmented members of OPEC, has been suffering from major oil disruptions, with multiple battles and blockades hindering efforts to revive output. The country pumped about 1.1 MMbpd last year, the highest since 2012, which was still just about two-thirds of its production before the 2011 civil war.

Haftar and the United Nations-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj in the western city of Tripoli are competing for control of Libya. Haftar's self-styled national army, the country's most powerful militia, controls a coastal area containing the major exporting terminals, and said its recent operations in the southern part of the country, including the capture of Sharara and the nearby El-Feel fields, is intended to expel militants and secure energy facilities.

Sharara is a joint venture between Libya's NOC, Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor. It has been shut since December when state guards and armed residents seized it for financial demands, the latest in several such closures over the past few years.

Despite the assurance that Sharara is secure and ready to restart, Sanalla said the NOC's safety concerns haven't been addressed. The security forces currently protecting the field are the same guards who have ""committed violent and terrorizing acts against workers,"" he said.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Cairo', 'Tripoli']",Libya won't restart largest field until militia leaves,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/2/25/libya-wont-restart-largest-field-until-militia-leaves,None,
11402943,2019-12-30,"LONDON (Bloomberg) - Oil rose for a fifth session, the longest run of gains since July, as a bigger-than-forecast decline in U.S. crude stockpiles eased oversupply concerns.

Futures climbed 0.6% in New York after closing at the highest level in three months on Friday. American crude supplies fell by 5.47 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 20, more than three times the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Elsewhere, Iraq resumed output at an oil field a day after protesters forced a halt in operations.

Oil is poised for the biggest yearly gain since 2016, after being boosted recently by a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and a commitment by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to deepen output cuts. Hedge funds remain upbeat on prices, increasing bullish wagers on Brent oil to a seven-month high, despite comments from Russia that OPEC+ would discuss ending supply curbs next year.

""Crude draws and positive market sentiment have been price-supportive in recent weeks,"" said UBS Group AG analyst Giovanni Staunovo. ""On the one hand, market participants are looking at rising tensions in Iraq and Libya, but on the other hand production has not been hit by those tensions.""

West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose 36 cents to $62.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 8:34 a.m. local time. Prices are also set for the biggest monthly gain since January.

Brent crude for February settlement added 66 cents, or 1%, to $68.82 a barrel on London's ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a $6.51 premium to WTI.

While concern lingers over rising production from non-OPEC nations including the U.S. and Brazil, some of those worries were countered by a drop in American crude inventories to the lowest level in two months.

11402944,2019-12-06,"ANKARA (Bloomberg) - Turkey and Libya officially approved a contentious maritime deal that may fuel an energy showdown in the gas-rich waters of the eastern Mediterranean, where both countries are at odds with Greece.

The Nov. 27 preliminary agreement demarcates an 18.6-nautical mile (35-kilometer) line that will form the maritime boundary separating what will be the two countries' respective exclusive economic zones. Libya's presidential council and Turkey's parliament approved the memorandum of understanding, Anadolu Agency said Friday. It is now expected to be filed with the United Nations.

""This agreement also amounts to a political message that Turkey can't be sidelined in the eastern Mediterranean and nothing can be really achieved in the region without Turkey's participation,"" Cagatay Erciyes, a senior foreign ministry official in charge of maritime and aviation boundary affairs, said on Thursday.

Greece, Cyprus and Egypt see the deal as a brazen Turkish bid for dominance in the contested waters. Libya is also in conflict with Greece over off-shore exploration licenses Athens issued for waters south of Crete, which is located between Turkey and Libya. Turkey, which has dispatched warships to accompany its drilling ships off the divided island of Cyprus, will issue more such permits for the Mediterranean following the deal with Libya, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said on Wednesday.

""Erdogan's strategy has been to intensify tensions to such an extent as to force serious concessions from Greek Cyprus during future negotiations on the status of the island and how its natural gas wealth will be distributed,"" said Anthony Skinner, Middle East and North Africa director at risk analyst Verisk Maplecroft. ""Standing up strongly for Turkish Cypriots constitutes part of Erdogan's nationalist credentials but also forms a key part of Turkey's political identity and will remain a priority national interest.""

Greece said the agreement violated continental-shelf and economic exclusive zones of its own islands, including Crete. But Erciyes said that Greek islands were ""lying on the wrong side of the median line between mainlands,"" arguing that the islands' minimal coastal lengths comparing to Turkey's mainland should not generate continental-shelf or economic exclusive zone. Erciyes shared a map of Turkey's claimed exclusive economic zone, including reference points to the latest agreement with Libya marked as ""E"" and ""F.""

The eastern Mediterranean has become a gas hot spot with big finds for Cyprus, Israel and Egypt in recent years. Turkey -- which captured northern Cyprus in the wake of a 1974 coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece -- vehemently opposes the Cypriot drilling without an agreement on sharing any proceeds with Turkish Cypriots. Egypt, whose relations worsened with Turkey after its elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi was overthrown in 2013, also denounced the deal with Libya.

Turkish drilling ships Fatih and Yavuz are currently operating off divided Cyprus in waters declared by Turkey as its own economic exclusive zone and under agreements with the northern Turkish Cypriot state, which is recognized only by Turkey. The European Union has said it is weighing sanctions against Turkey over its oil and natural-gas exploration off Cyprus, and Cyprus wants the International Court of Justice to resolve its dispute with Turkey.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ruled out any concessions on the deal with Libya. ""As long as the legitimate government in Libya stands firm on its feet, this new step will achieve its goal,"" he said Thursday.

Ankara last week also signed a defense agreement aimed at strengthening forces controlled by Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj's government in Tripoli, with the capital under attack from eastern-based strongman Khalifa Haftar.

11402945,2019-11-21,"LONDON (Bloomberg) - OPEC may have no appetite to cut oil production deeper when it meets next month, but flaring political crises across the group are once again threatening supply.

Unrest erupted in Iraq and Iran this month -- two of the Middle East's biggest producers -- as people took to the streets protesting financial hardship and bad governance. That's adding to the range of supply threats already afflicting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, from economic collapse in Venezuela and simmering discontent in Algeria to the recent missile attack on Saudi Arabia.

""We kind of had a second Arab Spring, but it's been under the radar,"" said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""The real question is what is going to happen in Iraq.""

Iraq, OPEC's second-biggest producer, has violently cracked down on demonstrations against corruption in recent weeks that have spread to the southern oil hub of Basra. Iran has seen its oil exports slashed by U.S. sanctions and is forcefully suppressing protests spurred by the resulting economic stagnation.

OPEC and its allies -- who together pump about half the world's oil -- will meet in Vienna in early December to consider production levels for 2020, having cut output this year to prevent a global surplus. Despite signs that fragile demand and surging U.S. shale supply will unleash a new glut, they've signaled no desire to reduce output further.

They may not have a choice.

In recent years, unplanned supply disruptions within OPEC nations have done as much to keep markets balanced as the cartel's deliberate cutbacks. Iran and Venezuela have lost a combined 1.7 million barrels a day since last October, more than all 24 nations in the OPEC+ coalition agreed to cut this year.

As turmoil intensifies across the group, next year could see more accidental losses: oil prices of about $60 a barrel are already below levels most OPEC nations need to cover government spending, and a further slump would only deepen the strain.

""There is no better way to put it: the geopolitical risk is rising in the Middle East again,"" said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London.

Algeria is struggling to placate a mass youth-led movement seeking change after ousting long-term President Abdelaziz Bouteflika earlier this year, and Libya remains split by armed factions. Ecuador, which will leave OPEC in January, suffered a 20% slump in oil production last month amid riots and looting.

In Iran, at least 106 people have been killed in protests triggered by an increase in gasoline prices, according to Amnesty International. The country's Islamic Revolutionary Guards said on Thursday that several alleged ""ring-leaders"" backed by foreign powers had been arrested by intelligence services.

Iraq Risk. The biggest risk is posed by Iraq, according to RBC's Croft. While the country's oil sector has proven robust during recent turbulence, even boosting output when Islamic State militants captured swathes of territory five years ago, the latest demonstrations reflect a new level of popular discontent.

""If you had attacks on infrastructure, oil workers going on strike -- Iraq is the place that could surprise the market,"" she said.

Iraq's current unrest is partly driven by widespread anger at Iranian interference in its politics, but as Iran's own troubles worsen that involvement will only intensify, according to Croft.

As it reels from U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign of ""maximum pressure"" -- aimed at forcing the Islamic Republic to curtail its nuclear program -- Tehran will likely retaliate by asserting its influence in the region, she said.

Iran could try to destabilize oil production in the south of Iraq, where American companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. operate, Croft said. There may also be consequences for Saudi Arabia.

Half of the kingdom's output capacity was temporarily knocked out when its Abqaiq processing facility was blasted by drones and missiles on Sept. 14. The brief disruption halted 5.7 million barrels a day, or about 5% of global oil supply.

Yemen's Houthi rebel group claimed credit and U.S. officials blamed their allies in Iran, though Tehran denied responsibility. It followed a spate of attacks on oil tankers in the region, which Washington also blamed on the Islamic Republic.

Unless Tehran is given relief from the sanctions squeezing its economy, further incidents are likely, said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former oil official at the White House under President George W. Bush. That could dramatically alter the anticipated picture of oversupply.

11402946,2019-10-28,"Leading producers plan to increase output, replace reserves

Activity in this region, stretching from western Asia to northwestern Africa, remains at a fairly high level. Indeed, our mid-year forecast in last month's issue shows that the Middle Eastern region's drilling should be up 6.5% this year. Likewise, the four main countries making up North African activity -- Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia -- are predicted to see their drilling rise 9.3%.

Similarly, Middle Eastern oil production has remained level over the last year, held back from an increase mostly by a 4.9% reduction in Iranian output. And North African output rose 3.8% last year, to more than 2.95 MMbopd. Much of the increases in both drilling and production can be traced to two things: 1) a renewed focus on reserve replacement by some countries; and 2) a deliberate plan by other countries to increase productive capacity beyond routine reserve replacement.

Saudi Arabia has long been an OPEC leader and swing producer in controlling world oil supply and stabilizing crude prices, holding 226 Bbbl of oil reserves and stated production capacity of 12 MMbopd.

At this writing, 5.7 MMbpd of Saudi Aramco's oil output were taken off-line, because of drone and missile attacks on the Abqaiq processing facility and the Khurais oil field. Huthi rebels claimed to have launched the attacks from Yemen. The attacks set off fires that caused significant damage. However, Aramco officials said that Khurais would be back online completely by the end of September. They said that the country's full productive capacity would be restored by November.

Meanwhile, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan to diversify the Saudi economy calls for private investment in Aramco through a bond offering and an IPO to sell 5% of the company. In rare financial disclosures related to the bond offering, Saudi Aramco reported $111.1 billion in after-tax profits for 2018 and estimated its total market value to be $2 trillion. Replacement of the Saudi energy minister with an investment banker, who heads the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, as chairman of Aramco likely indicates that the IPO, three years in the making, will take place soon.

In July 2019, Saudi Aramco produced 9.8 MMbopd, with spare capacity of 2.2 MMbopd. Aramco's major oilfields and their estimated daily production are listed in Table 1. Before the September attack, Saudi Aramco had pledged to export only 7 MMbopd to help stabilize oil markets, with the remaining 2.8 MMbopd to be used domestically.

The Vision 2030 roadmap also calls for generating 70% of the kingdom's power using natural gas. To produce natural gas for power generation and desalinization, Aramco is aggressively developing the kingdom's shale gas resources. According to Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser, the company has 16 active rigs drilling for shale gas as part of a $150-billion program to increase gas production to 23 Bcfd from the current 14 Bcfd over the next decade.

Saudi Aramco is investing heavily to continue development in its 101 conventional oil fields to maintain its 12-MMbpd capacity. Legendary Ghawar field (recently surpassed as the world's largest by the Permian basin) has declined, now producing 3.8 MMbopd, compared to its 5-MMbopd peak. The coastal Manifa field development has achieved target production of 900,000 bopd.

In addition, Aramco is expanding several mature offshore fields. The Safaniya Phase 7 redevelopment will receive $600 million to $700 million. The Zuluf field expansion should add 600,000 bpd of heavy crude production by 2023. Aramco also announced an $18-billion commitment for 34 contracts for engineering, 35 production platforms, and subsea pipelines in Marjan and Berri fields to increase production by 550,000 bopd and 2.5 Bcfd. Berri also will have nine new onshore drilling sites.

Baker Hughes Company reports that 77 onshore rigs were working in the kingdom during July 2019. With encouragement from the Saudi government, local companies have increased their ownership of rigs working in the kingdom and throughout the Middle East region.

Iraq. With 149 Bbbl of reserves, Iraq has recovered from its years of conflict , and now produces 4.88 MMbopd, up from 1.3 MMbopd in 2003. Oil contributes more than 90% of the country's public revenues. The rejuvenation of Iraq's production capacity has been made possible through participation by international oil companies (IOCs), which have brought financial and technical assistance.

Current production is close to the maximum 5.0 MMbopd attainable with existing facilities. Seven major fields among Iraq's 30 oil fields hold half of the country's reserves and contribute most of its production, Table 2. Aside from Kirkuk, all major fields are in the southern and central regions, sending crude to Basra export facilities for tanker transport.

IOCs have participated in Iraq's oil industry since 2009 through technical service contracts (TSCs) and production sharing contracts (PSCs), which pay a small fee (up to $2.00) for every barrel of incremental production. IOCs generally hold 75% interest in the fields, with the Iraqi national oil companies -- Basra Oil Co., North Oil Co., and Midland Oil Co. -- holding 25%.

ExxonMobil holds a TSC for West Qurna I field, plus six PSCs covering 848,000 acres in Iraqi Kurdistan. After operating in Iraq from the 1920s to the 1970s, BP returned to the country in 2009 with a TSC to increase production from giant Ramaila field. BP also provides technical assistance to North Oil Co. in Kirkuk field.

Russia's Lukoil holds the TSC for West Qurna II, and Eni and Korea Gas provide resources and expertise for Zubair field. CNPC's Petrochina has TSCs for Ahdab, Ramaila, and Halfaya I, II and III fields, and also has equity in West Qurna I. Chinese companies invested more than $2 billion in Iraq and are purchasing 1.5 MMbpd of Iraqi crude.

The Kurdistan regional government has managed fields in Iraq's north that produce less than 10% of the country's output. Oil produced there is sent by pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. After 93% of Kurds voted for independence in 2017, the Iraqi army advanced on the region and seized control of several oil fields, including Kirkuk.

Iraq has 132 Tcf of natural gas reserves, but for lack of pipelines, the country is flaring 1.7 Bcfd from its 30 fields. The Iraqi oil ministry has tasked state-run Midland Oil Co. to develop the 4.5-Tcf Mansuriya field. The ministry is working with IOCs to help reach a production goal of 300 MMcfd. Another big initiative to increase production capacity is the South Iraq Integrated Project. The proposed $53-billion project is designed to transport 12.5 MMbpd of seawater for injection to increase reservoir pressure in six fields.

United Arab Emirates. Ninety-six percent of the UAE's 98.63 Bbbl of oil reserves are in Abu Dhabi and controlled by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). ADNOC is pursuing its Smart Growth 2030 strategy, to increase production from the current 3.0 MMbopd to 4.0 MMbopd in 2020, and 5.0 MMbopd by 2030. The strategy also calls for Abu Dhabi to become self-sufficient in natural gas, and an LNG exporter. In November 2018, Abu Dhabi's Supreme Petroleum Council approved a $132-billion, five-year capital plan.

Chinese companies have invested prominently in ADNOC. Since 2017, CNPC has held 40-year stakes in ADNOC's onshore and offshore concessions. In July 2018, ADNOC and CNPC signed a ""strategic cooperation framework agreement,"" covering additional opportunities upstream, midstream and downstream. In March 2019, CNPC paid $1.2 billion for a 10% interest in the Lower Zakum, Umm Sharif, Nasir and Al Yasat concessions. China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation has an EPC contract to expand production from Bab field onshore.

Eni will contribute 25% of the development costs to develop ultra-sour gas in Ghasha, Hail and Dalma fileds. The objective is to produce 1.5 Bcfd by 2025, along with 120,000 bpd of oil and condensate. KBR and Artelia have been contracted to build artificial islands for this development. FEED contracts for infrastructure have been awarded to Bechtel and TechnipFMC.

Eni and Thailand's PTTEP acquired stakes in one onshore and two offshore fields in Abu Dhabi's first licensing round in 2018. Eni has small stakes in several other concessions. Indian companies Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil Co. Ltd. also won an onshore block. Occidental agreed in February 2019 to explore onshore Block 3.

To develop unconventional gas in the Ruwais Diyab concession, ADNOC awarded a 40-year, 40% stake to Total, to target 1.0-Bcfd production by 2030. ADNOC signed an EPC contract with Tecnicas Reunidas for a $1.4-billion upgrade of Bu Hasa field, which has been producing since 1965.

Iran. The Iranian Republic has yet to recover oil production levels achieved before 1979, and the current international situation has put the country's energy sector under considerable stress. Half of the country's production comes from fields that are more than 50 years old, and significant investment is needed. Facing U.S. sanctions, National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) has worked to develop the domestic oilfield equipment and supply industry; stored unsold crude oil both on- and offshore; and has sought foreign investment.

NIOC and the National Iranian Drilling Company reportedly have signed deals with 88 domestic manufacturers to produce equipment, including downhole tools, pumps, drill bits, and valves. More than 230 Iranian companies are seeking additional business with the two national firms.

Given the sanctions, Iran has sought investment and export markets in China, Russia and Turkey. China has continued to purchase up to 925,000 bopd from Iran through ""gray market"" sales. Significantly, China confirmed a 25-year agreement with Iran in August 2019, to invest $280 billion to develop Iran's oil, gas and petrochemical sectors, and another $120 billion in pipelines and manufacturing infrastructure.

After Total pulled out of the South Pars 11 development, due to sanctions, CNPC increased its stake in the field to 80%. CNPC and Sinopec are operating the West Karoun oil fields, with a plan to increase production 500,000 bopd by the end of 2020.

Kuwait has produced oil for more than 80 years, and investment in upgrades and increased output are past due. In 2018, the oil ministry outlined a $500-billion plan to increase production to 4.75 MMbopd and improve infrastructure, but the strategy has been implemented slowly. As of June 2019, $62 billion of projects were underway in the country.

Giant Burgan field, discovered in 1938, has been in decline but it still produces 1.7 MMbopd of the country's 3.25-MMbopd capacity. In 2017, Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) signed a technical service agreement with BP to extend field life. In addition, Petrofac has been contracted to install a 120,000-bopd gathering station, to start up in 2020.

Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) has awarded contracts for 86 drilling rigs, 47 of which are operating. KOC also has awarded Halliburton a $597-million contract to drill six HPHT offshore wells from two rigs. In addition, Kuwait has invested in heavy oil fields in its north, to increase heavy oil production from 60,000 bopd to 430,000 bopd by 2040.

Production in the Neutral Zone with Saudi Arabia has been shut-in since a 2015 dispute over Chevron's operatorship of Khafji field. Bloomberg reported that the two countries are close to an agreement that would make 500,000 bopd available to the market.

Qatar is the world's largest LNG exporter but produces only around 600,000 bopd. Last December, Qatar withdrew from OPEC, effective Jan. 1, 2019, to concentrate on its natural gas business. With 900 Tcf of recoverable reserves, Qatar's North Field in the Persian Gulf is the world's largest unassociated natural gas field. In 2005, Qatar Petroleum (QP) ceased further development of the field, to study its long-term sustainability. In April 2017, Qatar lifted the moratorium, announcing that it would increase LNG production 43%, from 77 million metric tons/year to 110 million metric tons/year by 2024, mostly through the North Field Expansion Project.

In April 2019, QP signed contracts for 80 new wells from eight platforms in the North Field Expansion. In addition, McDermott was awarded a $750-million EPCI contract for North Field sustainability, and a FEED contract for offshore wellhead platforms, pipelines and cables. QP has shortlisted IOCs, such as Total, ExxonMobil and Eni, to be partners in the North Field Expansion, although Qatar says that it can complete the project on its own.

Oman. According to the U.S. EIA, Oman during 2017 participated in production cuts agreed to by OPEC members. Because of this agreement, oil production fell from peak 2016 levels, averaging 974,600 bpd in 2017 and 978,550 bpd in 2018.

In July 2019, Petroleum Development Oman's (PDO) Rabab Harweel Integrated Project (RHIP, Fig. 1) entered the start-up phase with gas production from the first sour wells, marking a key milestone for the mega project and coming two months ahead of schedule.

This is a significant step in the commissioning process, and work is progressing to initiate and stabilise the hydrocarbon processing facilities and to line up more wells. The plant's capacity continues to be ramped up.

RHIP is an integrated oil and gas development across the Rabab and Harweel reservoirs in southern Oman. It is the largest capital project in PDO's history, representing a reserve addition of more than 500 MMboe.

Algeria still relies on hydrocarbon revenues for about one-third of total government funds. To attract additional foreign investment, the government has been drafting a new hydrocarbons law, which would make Algeria more competitive by reducing taxes, simplifying licensing and shortening the time to craft agreements. Currently, state firm Sonatrach owns about 80% of hydrocarbon production in Algeria, while IOCs account for the remaining 20%.

Despite sharply lower oil prices since July 2014, Sonatrach said that it will maintain investment of $18 billion to $23 billion annually. With most of Algeria's hydrocarbon output derived from mature, depleting fields (Fig. 2), but with a need to boost production, an emphasis is being placed on enhanced recovery technology. Accordingly, Sonatrach is working to form partnerships with foreign investors to transfer technology quicker.

Algerian oil reserves (crude and condensate) totaled an estimated 14.55 Bbbl at the end of 2018, and proved gas reserves are about 159.1 Tcf. Algeria produced an estimated 1.024 MMbpd of crude oil last year, plus another 280,000 bpd of lease condensate. During 2017, the U.S. EIA estimates (based on vessel tracking data) that Algeria exported roughly 580,000 bpd of crude and condensate.

Also, according to EIA, Algeria's gross natural gas production is running between 6.5 Tcf and 7.0 Tcf/year. Considerable amounts of gas are either reinjected into wells to enhance oil recovery or are vented/flared. The remainder is either used for domestic consumption or exported to other countries.

During the last two years, Algeria has been completing the first phase of its Southwest Gas Project. The first phase includes Reggane Nord and Timimoun fields, which began production in December 2017 and February 2018, respectively, along with Touat, which finally began exports on Sept. 9, 2019.

London-based Neptune Energy Group and Sonatrach began natural gas production during first-half 2019 as part of the commissioning of the partnership's Touat project in the Sbaa basin, 930 mi southwest of Algiers, near Adrar. The development will produce about 450 MMcfd of gas at plateau. Touat comprises eight gas fields and a gas processing plant. Project development involved drilling 18 development wells, along with gathering and treatment and other facilities.

Algeria possesses 707 Tcf of technically recoverable shale gas. Sonatrach reportedly has signed several cooperation agreements with IOCs to develop unconventional resources. According to Sonatrach, about two-thirds of Algerian territory remains unexplored or largely underexplored. Sonatrach is also pursuing offshore exploration, focused on two large geographical areas that look promising, based on seismic data.

In March 2019, Petrofac was awarded a $1-billion, 42-month contract by the joint operating group set up by Sonatrach, Petroceltic and Enel, for the Ain Tsila gas development. The EPC project scope includes commissioning, start-up and performance testing.

Since the 1990s, Egyptian officials have enacted various laws designed to attract additional operators and investments. Between November 2013 and December 2017, Egypt's oil sector signed 83 exploration and development deals with IOCs worth at least $15.5 billion, plus signing bonuses of more than $1 billion for the drilling of 319 wells. In 2018, a new international bidding round was announced, including blocks in the Gulf of Suez, Western Desert, Nile Delta and offshore Mediterranean. In 2019, the ministry awarded contracts for 12 new concessions featuring ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and other operators. Estimated initial investment is around $800 million.

The Egyptian government just closed a 2019 bidding round in August for 10 offshore tracts in the Red Sea. Winning bids should be announced in the next several months.

Government investment in natural gas projects increased 25% during FY 2017. This is in addition to a 33% boost during the previous fiscal year. In addition, several multinational firms announced commitments to increase their crude oil investments to a total of $10 billion during FY 2018-2019. Accordingly, Egyptian drilling should be up 6% this year.

Zohr field, the largest Egyptian and Mediterranean gas discovery ever made, sits within the offshore Shorouk Block. In December 2017, operator Eni started output from Zohr. By August 2019, Eni said Zohr production had reached more than 2.7 Bcfd, five months ahead of the Plan of Development (PoD). The start-up on Aug. 18, 2019, of the second 216-km, 30-in. pipeline, connecting subsea production facilities to an onshore treatment plant, paves the way to increase the field's production rate up to 3.2 Bcfd. Egypt's oil production was up about 1% in 2018, at 619,750 bpd. At the end of 2018, proven reserves stood at 3.1 Bbbl of oil and 77.5 Tcf of gas.

Libya's upstream sector has improved this year, although it is still somewhat precarious. Back in May, the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) reported monthly income of $2.3 billion from crude oil and product sales, along with taxes and royalties received from concession contracts. This represented a 24% monthly increase amounting to $448 million. Revenue figures were bolstered by stable global oil prices, as well as a steady crude loading schedule.

""These figures showcase the importance of a unified oil sector and its contribution to the economy,"" said NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla during an industry conference at the time, quoted by Oil and Gas Middle East. ""Our focus on crude production, despite ongoing security challenges, continues to bring success, with over $725 million having been spent on exploration and drilling since 2018.""

At that point, oil markets were generally ignoring Libya's ongoing civil war. However, on July 20, NOC reported that production at its El Sharara oil field had ceased. As a direct result, NOC also stopped the shipment of crude oil at the Port of Az Zawiyah, resulting in a production loss of 290,000 bopd and a force-majeure declaration that was lifted on July 22.

Officials indicated that an unidentified group shut a valve on the pipeline linking El Sharara to Zawiya, 30 mi west of Tripoli. The force-majeure brought official NOC output below 1 MMbopd, from a level of up to 1.3 MMbopd.

Meanwhile, back in May, Sanalla held meetings with U.S. companies at the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston, to recruit $60 billion of procurement contracts necessary to more than double Libyan oil production by 2023. This is part of Libya's plan to expand production from about 1.0 MMbopd now to 2.1 MMbopd by 2023.

Tunisia was set to almost double its natural gas production, to about 65,000 boed, once the southern Nawara gas field goes onstream. The project is jointly owned by OMV and ETAP, with investments of about $700 million.

The Nawara concession is derived from the Jenein Sud exploration permit. The project will deliver gas and by-products to the Tunisian market. Field facilities will pre-treat raw gas and recover condensate. A 24-in. pipeline will carry gas from the Nawara concession to a gas treatment plant in Gabès.

11402947,2019-09-23,"JAKARTA (Bloomberg) - Oil's dominance as a energy source may be on the wane, but one Indonesian producer is confident there's still plenty of opportunities to be had as the age of the hydrocarbon enters its final act.

PT Medco Energi Internasional is aiming to lift its oil and gas output from 120,000 boepd to 300,000 in the next five to 10 years, said president director Hilmi Panigoro. The explorer -- which already has fields from Indonesia to Libya to Mexico -- is most interested in buying existing onshore wells, he said in an interview in Jakarta.

Medco's strategy is based on Panigoro's view that a dearth of exploration and strong aviation and petrochemical demand will push crude prices above $100/bbl in a decade or so. That runs counter to the perspective of oil majors like BP, which said recently that some of its resources probably won't see the light of day due to low prices and an investor push for low-carbon projects.

Crude prices are likely to stay around $60/bbl in the short term, but ""in the long run it will be a different story as not enough investment is happening upstream to replace declining production,"" Panigoro said. There will be an oil shortage even if fossil fuel use ebbs as electric vehicles take off, he said.

Medco, which also owns copper and gold mines and gas-fired power plants in Indonesia, kicked off its buying spree with the purchase of Ophir Energy Plc this year for 408 million pounds ($513 million). Ophir has oil and gas assets in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam and the acquisition will add about 25,000 boepd to Medco's 2019 output, it said in a statement.

The company prefers onshore assets to deepwater projects because of the heavy capital investment required in offshore fields, said Panigoro, a graduate of the Colorado School of Mines. Medco will be ""opportunity driven"" and consider assets where the cost of production is $10/bbl or less, he said.

""There will always be money for the right assets,"" Panigoro said.

11402948,2019-09-18,"DUBAI (Bloomberg) - Saudi Arabia reassured anxious customers that crude exports will keep flowing as normal and its industry can recover quickly from the worst attack in its history.

Crude prices fell after Tuesday's long-awaited statement from the kingdom -- which pumped almost 10% of the world's oil before the crucial Abqaiq facility was struck by missiles or drones over the weekend. Yet it also became clear that Saudi Arabia's industry will remain weakened for months as it depletes oil reserves to meet supply commitments and operates without its usual buffer of spare production capacity.

""Considering limited spare capacity outside Saudi Arabia and risks of renewed attacks on Saudi energy infrastructure, a risk premium is likely to stay on oil prices in the foreseeable future,"" UBS Group AG analyst Giovanni Staunovo said in a note on Wednesday.

Even as Aramco fixes the damage at Abqaiq, the possibility of further escalation of military conflict hangs over the oil market. U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo traveled to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for talks. Later on Wednesday, the Saudi Defense Ministry will show evidence of Iran's involvement in the attacks against, according to state television.

Abqaiq is now processing about 2 MMbpd of crude, Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said at a briefing in Jeddah on Tuesday. The facility should return to pre-attack levels of about 4.9 MMbpd by the end of September, he said.

""During the two past days, we managed to contain the damage by recovering more than half of the production that we had lost during that terrorist attack,"" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a briefing in Jeddah. ""The company will be able to meet all its commitments to customers this month by drawing on its crude oil reserves.""

That was a relief for a market that has been wracked by uncertainty -- seeing a record price surge in Brent crude on Monday -- but progress has been slower than was initially expected. Soon after the weekend attack, officials indicated that the majority of output would be restored within days, with weeks required to get back to full capacity. The outlook became more pessimistic in subsequent days as photos were released showing the scale of the damage at the crucial facility.

The minister and CEO assured customers Aramco's crude exports won't be reduced this month because it will draw down strategic reserves. The kingdom also temporarily reduced the rate at which domestic refineries process oil by about 1 MMbpd, making more crude available for shipment overseas.

Still, figures provided by the energy minister suggested the kingdom will take months to fully recover from the incident. Full output capacity of 12 MMbpd will only be available at the end of November, with about 11 million restored by the end of this month, said Prince Abdulaziz. Saudi Arabia aims to pump 9.8 MMbpd in October, he said, in line with recent months.

Brent crude dropped 6.5% on Tuesday after the kingdom's reassurances, but that only partially erased Monday's 15% surge, which was the biggest since the contract started trading in 1988. Futures fell 0.8% to $64.07 a barrel as of 10:23 a.m. in London on Wednesday.

That historic price gain underscored the unprecedented nature of the disruption caused by the attack. For decades, Saudi Arabia has been the oil market's great stabilizer, maintaining a large cushion of spare production capacity that can be tapped in emergencies, such as during the 2011 war in Libya.

The suspension of 5.7 MMbpd of Saudi production by the attack -- the worst sudden loss in the history of the global oil market -- exposed the inadequacy of the rest of the world's supply buffer. Beyond the kingdom, other participants in the OPEC+ cuts, such as Russia, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates, could restore a few hundred thousand barrels a day of idled production, but that's not enough to offset Saudi losses.

Aramco ramped up offshore fields to maximum to replace some lost production, Nasser said. Customers were also being supplied using stockpiles, though some buyers are being asked to accept different grades of crude, a person familiar with the matter said earlier this week. The attacks had ""zero"" impact on the kingdom's revenues, Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in a Bloomberg TV interview.

For all the practical fixes to damaged infrastructure that are now underway, Saudi Arabia's failure to prevent the attacks and the risk of further military escalation in the region will hang over the oil market for a long time to come.

Tehran and Riyadh are historic foes backing opposing sides in Yemen's long-running civil war. The volatile situation in the region finally boiled over earlier this year as U.S. President Donald Trump used sanctions to attempt to choke off all of Iran's oil exports -- the lifeblood of its economy -- after unilaterally withdrawing from an international nuclear deal.

Since then, the Persian Gulf, source of about a third of the world's seaborne oil exports, has been under siege, targeted by air, sea and land. While Trump has shown some reluctance to go to war, there are also few prospects for easing tensions as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman decides how to respond to the assault.

Prince Abdulaziz said he wouldn't comment on whether Iran was responsible for the attack. The Pentagon is preparing a report on who was to blame and intends to make it public within 48 hours, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Tehran, said Monday that oil installations in Saudi Arabia will remain among their targets and their weapons can reach anywhere in the country. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday his country won't negotiate with the U.S. on any level.

11402949,2019-09-17,"DUBAI (Bloomberg) - Saudi Arabia attempted to move beyond the worst oil disruption in its history, assuring the world that crude exports will not suffer, its damaged facility had partially restarted and production capacity would be back to normal within months.

The long-awaited statement on Tuesday from the kingdom -- which before the strike pumped almost 10% of the world's oil -- gives the market much-needed clarity after days of speculation over how severe was the damage at the Abqaiq plant.

However, it's slower progress than was initially expected and crude prices remain elevated as traders factor in higher risks for Saudi supply.

""During the two past days, we managed to contain the damage by recovering more than half of the production that we had lost during that terrorist attack,"" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a briefing in Jeddah. ""Thus the company will be able to meet all its commitments to customers this month by drawing on its crude oil reserves.""

Slow Progress

Abqaiq has restarted and is now processing about 2 million barrels a day, said Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser. The facility should return to pre-attack levels of about 4.9 million barrels a day by the end of September, he said.

Soon after the weekend attack, officials indicated that the majority of output would be restored within days, with weeks required to get back to full capacity. That outlook became more pessimistic in subsequent days as photos were released showing the scale of the damage at the crucial facility.

Exports Maintained

The minister and CEO assured customers that Aramco's crude exports won't be reduced this month because it will draw down strategic reserves. The kingdom also temporarily reduced the rate at which its domestic refineries process oil by about 1 million barrels a day, making more crude available for shipment overseas.

Still, figures provided by the energy minister suggested the kingdom will take months to fully recover from the incident. Full output capacity of 12 MMbpd will only be available at the end of November, with about 11 MMbpd restored by the end of this month, said Prince Abdulaziz. Saudi Arabia aims to pump 9.8 MMbpd in October, he said, in line with recent months.

The oil market has been gripped with uncertainty since the attack -- initially claimed by Houthi rebels in Yemen, but later blamed on Iran by the U.S. Brent crude fell 5.7% to $59.31 a barrel in London as of 7:24 p.m. The international benchmark jumped the most on record on Monday.

Unprecedented Disruption

That historic price gain underscored the unprecedented nature of the disruption caused by the attack. For decades, Saudi Arabia has been the oil market's great stabilizer, maintaining a large cushion of spare production capacity that can be tapped in emergencies, such as the 2011 war in Libya.

The halt of 5.7 MMbpd of the kingdom's production -- the worst sudden supply loss in history -- exposed the inadequacy of the rest of the world's supply buffer. Aramco ramped up its offshore oil fields to maximum replace some of the lost production, Nasser said. Customers were also being supplied using stockpiles, though some buyers are being asked to accept different grades of crude, a person familiar with the matter said earlier this week.

But beyond the kingdom, other participants in the OPEC+ cuts, such as Russia, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates, could restore a few hundred-thousand barrels a day of idled production, but not enough to offset the Saudi losses.

11402950,2019-09-17,"DUBAI (Bloomberg) - The oil market is facing a prolonged disruption to Saudi Arabia's oil production with few options for replacing such huge output losses.

The weekend attacks on the kingdom eliminated about 5% of global oil supply, propelling Brent crude to a record surge on Monday. Officials at state oil company Saudi Aramco have become less optimistic on the pace of output recovery, telling a senior foreign diplomat they face a ""severe"" disruption measured in weeks and months and informing some customers that October shipments will be delayed.

The historic price gain underscores the unprecedented nature of the disruption caused by the drone attack on the Abqaiq crude processing plant. For decades, Saudi Arabia has been the oil market's great stabilizer, maintaining a large cushion of spare production capacity that can be tapped in emergencies, such as the 2011 war in Libya.

The halt of 5.7 MMbpd of the kingdom's production -- the worst sudden supply loss in history -- exposes the inadequacy of the rest of the world's supply buffer.

Little to Spare

""The market is in scramble mode to secure not only supplies of crude, but also products,"" consultant JBC Energy GmbH said in a note. Prices are ""reflecting a new geopolitical risk premium, namely that the safety of oil production in the heart of the Middle East cannot be guaranteed.""

Saudi Aramco is firing up idle offshore oil fields to replace some of the lost production, said a person familiar with the matter. Customers are also being supplied using stockpiles, though some buyers are being asked to accept different grades of crude. The kingdom has enough domestic inventories to cover about 26 days of exports, according to consultant Rystad Energy A/S.

U.S. President Donald Trump also authorized the release of oil from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, while the International Energy Agency, which helps coordinate industrialized countries' emergency fuel stockpiles, said it was monitoring the situation.

Saudi Stockpiles

According to Bloomberg calculations based on publicly available data, the absolute maximum in spare capacity that could be brought into production in the coming weeks is about 3.9 million barrels a day.

The true volume of viable backup supply could be significantly lower, because it includes restarting production from the Neutral Zone shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, as well as tapping the kingdom's own spare capacity, much of which may also have to be processed at the Abqaiq or Khurais facilities and therefore be unusable.

OPEC Capacity

Other participants in the OPEC+ cuts, such as Russia, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates, could restore a few hundred-thousand barrels a day of production, not enough to offset the Saudi losses.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is in regular contact with the Saudi authorities, the group's Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said in a Bloomberg TV interview. It's premature to talk about reversing the oil-production cuts implemented by OPEC and its allies, he said.

U.S. output may be booming, but the country's many shale drillers hold little to no output in reserve. Oil production has plateaued at an average level of 12.37 MMbpd since recovering from the impact of Hurricane Barry at the end of July.

Output will continue to grow and more than 10 new export terminals have been proposed for U.S. crude, capable of handling about 8 MMbpd, but the first of these is unlikely to be operational before 2022 at the earliest.

Crude prices pared gains on Tuesday, following an extraordinary trading day in which Brent crude leaped settled a record 15% higher at just above $69. Futures were 0.3% lower at $68.80/bbl as of 8:44 a.m. in London as the market waited for any further update from Aramco.

Images released of the damage to Abqaiq's stabilization towers, which separate gaseous compounds from crude oil, suggest lengthy repairs, according to Phillip Cornell, a former senior corporate planning adviser to Aramco.

""They can take weeks or months to get specialized parts,"" he said at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council in Washington on Monday. Five out of 18 stabilization towers appear to have been taken out and the pictures that have been released show ""very specific, accurate targeting of those particular infrastructures,"" he said.

In addition to the immediate loss of supply, the attack raised the specter of U.S. retaliation against Iran, which could further inflame oil prices. While Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the assault, President Trump said it looked like Iran was to blame.

11402951,2019-09-16,"LONDON (Bloomberg) - Here is a list of countries that could boost crude production to offset losses from Saudi Arabia in the event that the disruption to supplies from the attacks on its Abqaiq and Khurais processing facilities lasts longer than initially expected. It's not a long list and much may not be accessible.

The attacks cut Saudi production by 5.7 MMbpd and officials at state oil company Saudi Aramco have become less optimistic on the pace of output recovery. The maximum spare capacity that could be brought into production in the coming weeks is estimated at about 3.9 MMbpd.

That figure should be treated as a exercise in optimism, though. It includes restarting production from the Neutral Zone shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, as well as tapping Saudi Arabia's own spare capacity, much of which may also have to be processed at the Abqaiq or Khurais facilities and therefore be unusable.

Saudi Arabia

On paper, Saudi Arabia has about 1.7 MMbpd of spare production capacity, but the precise location of that reserve is unclear. If it is in the giant Ghawar, Shaybah or Khurais fields, it's unlikely to be of any use, as crude from those fields is processed at Abqaiq.

There is some spare capacity at offshore fields, such as Manifa and Safaniyah. Offshore crude is not processed at Abqaiq, so these fields could be pressed into service.

United Arab Emirates

U.A.E. output peaked at 3.27 MMbpd in November 2018 and levels beyond that have not been tested on an on-going basis. This suggests the country could boost output by somewhere between 200,000 and 330,000 bpd.

Kuwait

Kuwait's reported crude production capacity is 3.15 MMbpd, excluding its share of the Neutral Zone that it shares with Saudi Arabia, but it has not produced more than 3 million since the 1970s. Current production of 2.68 MMbpd suggests it could increase output by at most 470,000 bbl.

Neutral Zone

Shared by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the Khafji and Wafra fields in the Neutral Zone have been shut since 2015 as a result of a dispute between the two countries. They have the capacity to pump as much as 500,0000 bpd of heavy oil. Khafji is a northern extension of Saudi Arabia's Safaniyah field.

Restarting production in the Neutral Zone cannot be done overnight, though. Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said in Dubai last week that issues on the Neutral Zone are mostly technical and that he expects to have a ""clear picture"" on them within the next couple of months.

Russia

Russia has been cutting oil production as part of the OPEC+ deal. Output reached a peak of 11.45 MMbpd in December, before the latest cuts came into effect in January. The country's oil companies can certainly restore output to that level and may be able to go beyond it. Winter often sees an increase in Russian oil production, as increased domestic natural gas use results in a boost to flows of condensate, a light form of crude pumped from gas fields, although this is not a good substitute for most Saudi export grades.

Kazakhstan

Although Kazakhstan is a member of the OPEC+ group, its only supply reduction this year has been the result of planned maintenance at its largest oil fields. August oil production was restricted by maintenance at the country's largest field, Tengiz, where works were completed in early September. Planned maintenance is now underway at the Karachaganak field until mid-October, which has taken output back down to the average August level. Kazakhstan will not be able to boost crude production until that work is completed.

Angola

Angola's oil production has been crimped by maintenance and by steep decline rates at its offshore fields that have not been offset by new prospects being brought into production. August output was 1.4 MMbpd, down from 1.53 million in October, but the country would probably struggle to lift output back to that higher level and keep it there for any length of time.

Algeria

Algeria has cut output as part of the OPEC+ agreement, although it remains unclear how much of the reduction of about 50,000 bpd since November is voluntary and how much, if any, is the result of natural decline at the country's oil fields.

Oman

Oman's Ministry of Oil and Gas reported production at 970,000 bpd in August. That puts its spare capacity at just 30,000 bpd, a little more than the 25,000 bbl it agreed to cut under the current OPEC+ deal.

U.S.

U.S. oil production has plateaued at an average level of 12.37 MMbpd since recovering from the impact of Hurricane Barry at the end of July. A jump in weekly production numbers to 12.5 million bbl was not sustained and output slipped back to 12.4 million the following week - production is now reported to the nearest 0.1 MMbpd. U.S. crude exports have been back up above 3 MMbpd since mid-August.

More than 10 new export terminals have been proposed for U.S. crude, capable of handling about 8 MMbpd, but the first of these is unlikely to be operational before 2022 at the earliest. Export infrastructure may be the limiting factor in any U.S. output boost in the coming weeks and that could restrict the upside to about 475,000 bpd.

Iran

With exports crippled by U.S. sanctions, Iran could theoretically boost production by about 1.6 MMbpd. But with the U.S. blaming it for the attacks curbs on the country's oil sector are likely to get tougher, rather than ease.

Other OPEC+ countries

None of the other OPEC countries has any significant spare production capacity.

Iraq, which increased its oil production to a record 4.78 MMbpd in August, agreed at the OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting in Abu Dhabi last week to rein in supply. Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban says he gave orders to start cutting crude exports, with a reduction of at least 125,000 bpd from September. Those cuts will now probably be reversed, but output is unlikely to rise much above August's level.

Other OPEC countries are pumping at, or very close to capacity levels. Output from Libya remains hostage to the security situation in the country, but is close to the highest levels achieved since the toppling of Moammar Al Qaddafi in 2011. Production from Nigeria has been rising with the start-up of new fields and a reduction in the number of attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger River delta region. Production is now back close to levels last seen in 2015, with little scope for further quick increases.

Other non-OPEC members of the OPEC+ group - Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, South Sudan and Sudan - have, for the most part, offered up natural decline as output cuts. As a result, they are all producing as much as they are able and have no spare capacity that they could use to boost output.

The bottom line, though, is that much depends on Saudi Arabia itself. If the kingdom's extra capacity needs to pass through Abqaiq then it may be spare -- just not necessarily available.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Abqaiq', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Kuwait', 'London', 'Khafji', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Kazakhstan', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Dubai', 'Oman', 'Algeria', 'Angola', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Iran', 'Iraq']",Who can boost crude supply to offset attack on Saudi Arabia?,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/9/16/who-can-boost-crude-supply-to-offset-attack-on-saudi-arabia,None,
11402952,2019-08-22,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that OPEC members earned almost $711 billion in net oil export revenues in 2018. The estimate is up 29% from 2017, but about 40% lower than the record high of almost $1,200 billion in 2012. The 2018 earnings increase is mainly a result of higher crude oil prices. The Brent spot price rose from an annual average of $54/bbl in 2017 to $71/bbl in 2018. However, EIA forecasts annual OPEC net oil export revenues will decline to $593 billion in 2019 and to $556 billion in 2020. Decreasing OPEC revenues are primarily a result of decreasing production among a number of OPEC producers.

EIA estimates net oil export revenues based on oil production -- including crude oil, condensate, and natural gas plant liquids -- and total petroleum consumption estimates, as well as crude oil prices forecast in the August 2019 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). EIA's net oil export revenues estimate assumes that exports are sold at prevailing spot prices and adjusts the prices for benchmark crude oils forecast in STEO (Brent, West Texas Intermediate, and the average imported refiner crude oil acquisition cost) with historical price differentials among spot prices for the different OPEC crude oil types. For countries that export several different varieties of oil, EIA assumes that the proportion of total net oil exports represented by each variety is the same as the proportion of the total domestic production represented by that variety. For example, if Arab Medium represents 20% of total oil production in Saudi Arabia, the estimate assumes that Arab Medium also represents 20% of total net oil exports from Saudi Arabia.

Although OPEC net export earnings include estimated Iranian revenues, they are not adjusted for possible price discounts that trade press reports indicated Iran may have offered its customers after the United States announced its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in May 2018. The United States reinstated sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports in November 2018. Similarly, EIA does not adjust for Venezuelan crude oil exports to China or India for volumes that are sent for debt repayments to China and Russian energy company Rosneft, respectively, and thus do not generate cash revenue for Venezuela.

If the $711 billion in net oil export revenues by all of OPEC is divided by total population of its member countries and adjusted for inflation, then per capita net oil export revenues across OPEC totaled $1,416 in 2018, up 26% from 2017. The increase in per capita revenues likely benefited member countries that rely heavily on oil sales to import goods, fund social programs, and otherwise support public services.

In addition to benefiting from higher prices, some OPEC member countries have increased export revenues by reducing domestic consumption and consequently exporting more. For example, Saudi Arabia has significantly reduced the amount of crude oil burned for power generation. Limiting crude oil burn allowed Saudi Arabia to export more crude oil and to maximize revenues.

Others have been able to charge higher premiums based on the quality of their crude oil streams. As the global slate of crude oil has changed with more light crude oil production (with higher API gravity), OPEC members have benefited from a narrowing price discount for their heavy crude oils, which are typically priced lower than lighter crude oils because of quality differences. Smaller discounts for OPEC members' heavier crude streams contributed to higher spot prices for the OPEC crude oil basket price, which incorporates spot prices for the major crude oil streams from all OPEC members.

Despite the increase in annual average crude oil prices in 2018, OPEC revenues fell during the second half of 2018, mainly because of lower production and export volumes from Iran and Venezuela (Figure 4). EIA estimates that OPEC total petroleum liquids production decreased slightly in 2018 when increased production in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Libya could not offset significant declines in Iranian and Venezuelan production. Combined crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela fell by almost 800,000 bpd, or 14%, in 2018 and again by over 1.0 MMbpd in the first seven months of 2019. Although Iranian net oil export revenues increased by 18% from 2017 to 2018, a year-to-date comparison indicates a significant decrease in revenues in 2019. EIA estimates that from January to July 2018, Iran received about $40 billion in export revenues, compared with an estimated $17 billion from January to July 2019. Further decreases in OPEC members' production beyond current EIA assumptions would further reduce EIA's OPEC revenue estimates for 2019 and 2020.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Washington (state)', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Iran', 'Venezuela', 'United States', 'China', 'Russia', 'India', 'Iraq']","EIA: 2018 OPEC net export revenues highest since 2013, but likely to decline",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/8/22/eia-2018-opec-net-export-revenues-highest-since-2013-but-likely-to-decline,None,
11402953,2019-08-01,"LONDON (Bloomberg) - OPEC's output, already at the lowest since 2014, slid again last month as U.S. sanctions took a further toll on exports from Iran.

Iran has been pumping the least crude since the mid-1980s as the U.S. imposes penalties on any country or company that deals with Tehran, part of President Donald Trump's campaign to pressure the country over its nuclear program. Iranian production dropped by 70,000 bps last month to 2.21 MMbpd, according to a Bloomberg survey.

That was the biggest decline among the 14 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, though there were others too, according to the survey of officials, analysts and ship-tracking data. The cartel's production fell by 130,000 bpd to 29.87 MMbpd, the lowest in five years, though changes in membership since then blur the comparison.

OPEC reduced output at the start of this year as part of an agreement with other producers, such as Russia, to prevent an oil glut forming amid faltering demand and surging U.S. shale production.

The strategy has shown mixed results. Although oil prices climbed almost 30% in the first quarter of this year, they've since eased, and at just under $65/bbl in London are below the levels most OPEC nations need to cover government spending.

Prices have gained some support in recent weeks as Trump continues to pile diplomatic pressure on Iran, which has been accused of retaliating by seizing and targeting tankers passing through the Persian Gulf.

After Iran, the next-biggest declines in OPEC's production last month were in Iraq and Libya, which both saw losses of 50,000 bpd. Libya's output, erratic for several years as political factions vie for control of the country, slipped as an unidentified group briefly halted its biggest oil field, Sharara.

The losses were partially offset by gains elsewhere, such as in OPEC's biggest member, Saudi Arabia.

Production increased by 50,000 pd to 9.87 MMbpd in the kingdom, which often hikes output during the summer months to meet an increase in domestic demand for power generation. Even with the boost, Riyadh is keeping supplies well below the target agreed with fellow OPEC nations.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Iran', 'London', 'Tehran', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Iraq']",OPEC production lowest since 2014 as U.S. squeeze on Iran continues,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/8/1/opec-production-lowest-since-2014-as-us-squeeze-on-iran-continues,None,
11402954,2019-07-31,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) --Libya's oil production dropped to about 950,000 bpd, its lowest in five months, after the unauthorized closing of a valve on a pipeline linking the country's largest oil field to an export terminal on the Mediterranean Sea.

The Sharara field started shutting down on Tuesday at 10 p.m., four people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the information wasn't public. The deposit, which can pump about 300,000 bpd, is operated by a joint venture between Libya's National Oil Corp. and Total SA, Repsol SA, OMV AG and Equinor ASA.

The NOC declared force majeure on Sharara oil on Wednesday, according to two people familiar with the situation who requested anonymity because the information isn't public. Loading at the Zawiya oil port was also suspended, they said.

Sharara was also briefly shut and force majeure announced about 11 days ago after an unidentified group closed a valve there. Libya's current, reduced production figure was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the situation who lacked authorization to speak to media and asked not to be identified.

Force majeure is a legal status protecting a party from liability if it can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control.

Libya holds Africa's largest proven oil reserves but has endured severe disruptions to its output and exports due to battles and blockades among rival armed groups. Earlier in July, before the first halt of the month at Sharara, the NOC said oil production was about 1.3 MMbpd -- its highest in six years but still well below the level of output before the civil war that overthrew dictator Moammar Al Qaddafi in 2011.

Sharara in southwestern Libya has experienced sporadic shutdowns as various groups press political or financial demands. Production there stopped for three months late last year after guards and armed residents seized the field and demanded payments, costing the NOC about $1.8-billion in lost oil sales.

OMV lowered its production forecast on Wednesday, citing a first-quarter shutdown in Libyan production as one of the main reasons. Although that particular incident was resolved, the security situation in Libya has affected the Vienna-based company's output, Chief Executive Officer Rainer Seele said in an interview.

Libya's oil revenues are expected to drop by as much as 17% in 2019 to $20 billion as a result of disruptions in output, Tripoli-based central bank Governor Sadiq Al-Kabir said in an interview last week.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Cairo', 'Zawiya, Libya']",Libya output drops to post-March low as biggest field halted,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/7/31/libya-output-drops-to-post-march-low-as-biggest-field-halted,None,
11403343,2019-06-28,"LONDON (Bloomberg) --For an OPEC+ meeting in which the key decision over an output-cut extension is supposedly ""in the bag,"" according to Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih, Monday's gathering in Vienna could be as closely watched as any during the three-year coalition.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies convene next week to discuss extending a 1.2 MMbpd into the second half. While the cartel's three biggest members -- Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates -- are all willing to continue the policy of reduced production, Russia remains circumspect, prompting questions over potential changes to policy.

Meanwhile, myriad uncertainties cloud the oil market outlook. An ongoing U.S. and China trade spat is stoking fears over demand growth, while escalating tension between the U.S. and Iran has heightened geopolitical risk in the world's biggest oil-producing region.

Following are the latest positions of most of OPEC, plus non-OPEC members Russia and Azerbaijan. The respective shares of supply are based on May output. Estimates for the price each member needs to balance its 2019 budget are from the International Monetary Fund, unless otherwise specified.

Algeria's output has remained relatively stable at around 1 MMbpd, according to Bloomberg data. Political uncertainty is emerging, however, with a presidential election and transition of power pending in 2019, following the April resignation of aging President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after two decades.

Underinvestment and a natural decline in maturing oil fields has resulted in Angola's output falling by about 350,000 bpd over the last four years, averaging 1.44 MMbpd in 2019. That's the lowest in more than a decade and less than OPEC's assigned quota of 1.48 MMbpd, meaning it is likely to back an extension.

Saudi Arabia got a fillip last week when Azerbaijan, one of OPEC's biggest allies, said it supports an extension of the production-cuts deal into the second half. ""It would be right to extend the same regime"" unless something happens to change the current situation, Azeri Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov told reporters. Kazakhstan, its Caspian Sea neighbor, also backs an extension.

Iran's crude output and exports tumbled after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked oil sales in May. Observed crude flows dropped to 190,000 bpd in the first half of June, less than a tenth of the volume shipped in early 2018, according to Bloomberg data. Production is now at the lowest level since the 1980s.

Despite a poor record of adherence to the deal (implementing just 26% of its pledged cuts on average in 2017 and 2018) Iraq's Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban reaffirmed his commitment to the OPEC+ production cuts. Ghadhban had previously said that Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer, sees the group and its allies extending production cuts ""at least"" on current terms without ""serious difficulties."" Crude output has held steady above 4.5 MMbpd in 2019.

Kuwait will support OPEC's oil-production cuts until the end of 2019 when the group meets in Vienna next week, Kuwait Oil Minister Khaled Al-Fadhel told state-run Kuwait News Agency. The country has been in full compliance with output cuts. It curbed more than was pledged in May, trimming output by 99,000 bpd, against a required 85,000 bpd.

Exempt from cuts, Libya's production reached 1.25 MMbpd in May, a six-year high. Threats to production remain, however, as Libya's eastern commander, Khalifa Haftar, in June vowed to press ahead with an offensive on the capital until militias there are disbanded. He also intends to dissolve the UN-backed government currently headed by Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj.

Nigeria's production exceeded 1.8 MMbpd in 2019 thanks to the ramp up at Total's Egina offshore field. This means the country has cut output by less than pledged. In May it only reduced output by 5,000 bpd (or 9%), against a pledged 53,000, making it the least compliant of all 21 nations signed up to the deal.

Russia has spent 2019 inching toward its output commitments, finally reaching its target in May. It was aided in its task with the discovery of contaminated crude in its main export pipeline to Europe. Non-OPEC's largest producer has maintained a wait-and-see policy regarding an extension. ""We have certain differences in opinion regarding the fair price"" compared with Saudi Arabia, President Vladimir Putin told reporters in June. ""$60-65/bbl suits us just fine"" because Russia's budget is based on $40 crude, he said.

Energy Minister Al-Falih is confident a deal will be done, with the only question being whether there needs to be an adjustment to the pledged cut level in the second half. Saudi Arabia agreed to reduce production by 322,000 bpd for the first half of this year. In May, it cut by an average of 943,000 bpd instead, achieving a record 293% compliance rate.

Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei is ""not expecting a very difficult process in approving the extension,"" with discussions at the July meeting set to focus on the duration of the agreement, he said in late June. The country is still targeting higher crude output in the longer term, with the chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi National Oil, Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber, saying it will increase oil output capacity to 4 million bpd by 2020, and 5 MMbpd by 2030.

Crippling economic sanctions and years of mismanagement means production continued to decline this year, plunging 34% to May. This follows a 28% drop in 2018. Output for May was at 810,000 bpd, the lowest since January 2003, according to Bloomberg data.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Iraq', 'Azerbaijan', 'Vienna', 'London', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Kazakhstan', 'Kuwait', 'Algeria', 'China', 'Angola', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Nigeria']","OPEC keen to extend cut, Russia is cautious",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/6/28/opec-keen-to-extend-cut-russia-is-cautious,None,
11403344,2019-03-11,"LONDON and TOKYO (Bloomberg) -- Oil rose as Saudi Arabia was said to extend deep supply cuts into April.

Futures in New York climbed as much as 1.3% after dropping 1% on Friday. Saudi Arabia plans to produce well below 10 MMbpd in April, a similar pace to March, when it cut output by 500,000 barrels a day from February, a Saudi official said. The move is the latest sign that Riyadh is determined to regain control of the oil market as prices remain well below the level that many OPEC members need to cover their government spending.

""Saudi Arabia at the moment is willing to cover any number of compliance sins from others, by adjusting unilaterally,"" said Derek Brower, a director at consultant RS Energy Group.

Oil has traded in a tight range above $55 this month in New York, after rallying more than 30% from December-lows amid output curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, and unexpected supply disruptions in some member states including Venezuela. Meanwhile, U.S. production remains at a record high, even as the nation's rig count fell to a 10-month low. Uncertainty over a trade dispute between the world's top two economies has also weighed on prices.

West Texas Intermediate for April delivery rose as much as 72 cents to $56.79/bbl on the New York Mercantile Exchange and traded at $56.50 as of 13:01 p.m. London time. The contract fell 59 cents to $56.07 on Friday.

Brent for May settlement advanced 57 cents to $66.31/bbl on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after falling 56 cents on Friday. The global benchmark crude traded at a $9.46 premium to WTI for the same month.

With planned exports of less than 7 MMbpd, Saudi Arabia will supply its clients with significantly less oil than they requested in April, the official said. The country's deep production cuts show the world's largest oil exporter is determined to re-balance the market more quickly even though events in Venezuela have left some refiners short of crude.

Elsewhere in OPEC, Libya's production is said to be on course to hit an almost six-year high this month after the country restarted its biggest field on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, investors across financial markets continue to seek clarity on whether the U.S. and China can resolve a trade conflict.

11403354,2019-12-31,"TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- When the European Union started funneling millions of euros into Libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the Mediterranean, the money came with EU promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking.

That hasn't happened. Instead, the misery of migrants in Libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the EU and enabled by the United Nations, an Associated Press investigation has found.

The EU has sent more than 327.9 million euros to Libya, with an additional 41 million approved in early December, largely funneled through UN agencies. The AP found that in a country without a functioning government, huge sums of European money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen, traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants. In some cases, UN officials knew militia networks were getting the money, according to internal emails.

The militias torture, extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the UN, often in compounds that receive millions in European money, the AP investigation showed. Many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers, sold to traffickers or to other centers.

The same militias conspire with some members of Libyan coast guard units. The coast guard gets training and equipment from Europe to keep migrants away from its shores. But coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias, the AP found, and receive bribes to let others pass en route to Europe.

The militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off European funds given through the UN to feed and otherwise help migrants, who go hungry. For example, millions of euros in UN food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader, even as other UN teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center, according to emails obtained by the AP and interviews with at least a half-dozen Libyan officials.

In many cases, the money goes to neighboring Tunisia to be laundered, and then flows back to the militias in Libya.

___

This story is part of an occasional series, ""Outsourcing Migrants,"" produced with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

The story of Prudence Aimée and her family shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through Libya.

Aimée left Cameroon in 2015, and when her family heard nothing from her for a year, they thought she was dead. But she was in detention and incommunicado. In nine months at the Abu Salim detention center, she told the AP, she saw ""European Union milk"" and diapers delivered by UN staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children, including her toddler son. Aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink, she said.

In 2017, an Arab man came looking for her with a photo of her on his phone.

""They called my family and told them they had found me,"" she said. ""That's when my family sent money."" Weeping, Aimée said her family paid a ransom equivalent of $670 to get her out of the center. She could not say who got the money.

She was moved to an informal warehouse and eventually sold to yet another detention center, where yet another ransom -- $750 this time -- had to be raised from her family. Her captors finally released the young mother, who got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol, after her husband paid $850 for the passage. A European humanitarian ship rescued Aimée, but her husband remains in Libya.

Aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the AP at sea, in Europe, Tunisia and Rwanda, and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in Libya. Journalists also spoke with Libyan government officials, aid workers and businessmen in Tripoli, obtained internal UN emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts.

The issue of migration has convulsed Europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016, fleeing violence and poverty in the Mideast, Afghanistan and Africa. In 2015, the European Union set up a fund intended to curb migration from Africa, from which money is sent to Libya. The EU gives the money mainly through the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the High Commissioner for Refugees. (UNHCR).

But Libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war. The west, including the capital Tripoli, is ruled by a UN-brokered government, while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander Khalifa Hifter. The chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants.

The EU's own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to Libya. Budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium-to-high risk that Europe's support would lead to more human rights violations against migrants, and that the Libyan government would deny access to detention centers. A recent EU assessment found the world was likely to get the ""wrong perception"" that European money could be seen as supporting abuse.

Despite the roles they play in the detention system in Libya, both the EU and the UN say they want the centers closed. In a statement to the AP, the EU said that under international law, it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers.

""Libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards,"" the statement said.

The EU also says more than half of the money in its fund for Africa is used to help and protect migrants, and that it relies on the UN to spend the money wisely.

The UN said the situation in Libya is highly complex, and it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants.

""UNHCR does not choose its counterparts,"" said Charlie Yaxley, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency. ""Some presumably also have allegiances with local militias.""

After two weeks of being questioned by the AP, UNHCR said it would change its policy on awarding of food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries.

""Due in part to the escalating conflict in Tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of UNHCR's programme, UNHCR decided to contract directly for these services from 1 January 2020,"" Yaxley said.

Julien Raickman, who until recently was the Libya mission chief for the aid group Médecins Sans Frontières, also known as Doctors Without Borders, believes the problem starts with Europe's unwillingness to deal with the politics of migration.

""If you were to treat dogs in Europe the way these people are treated, it would be considered a societal problem,"" he said.

EXTORTION INSIDE THE DETENTION CENTERS

About 5,000 migrants in Libya are crowded into between 16 and 23 detention centers at any given time, depending on who is counting and when. Most are concentrated in the west, where the militias are more powerful than the weak UN-backed government.

Aid intended for migrants helps support the al-Nasr Martyrs detention center, named for the militia that controls it, in the western coastal town of Zawiya. The UN's migration agency, the IOM, keeps a temporary office there for medical checks of migrants, and its staff and that of the UNHCR visit the compound regularly.

Yet migrants at the center are tortured for ransoms to be freed and trafficked for more money, only to be intercepted at sea by the coast guard and brought back to the center, according to more than a dozen migrants, Libyan aid workers, Libyan officials and European human rights groups. A UNHCR report in late 2018 noted the allegations as well, and the head of the militia, Mohammed Kachlaf, is under UN sanctions for human trafficking. Kachlaf, other militia leaders named by the AP and the Libyan coast guard all did not respond to requests for comment.

Many migrants recalled being cut, shot and whipped with electrified hoses and wooden boards. They also heard the screams of others emerging from the cell blocks off-limits to UN aid workers.

Families back home are made to listen during the torture to get them to pay, or are sent videos afterward.

Eric Boakye, a Ghanaian, was locked in the al-Nasr Martyrs center twice, both times after he was intercepted at sea, most recently around three years ago. The first time, his jailers simply took the money on him and set him free. He tried again to cross and was again picked up by the coast guard and returned to his jailers.

""They cut me with a knife on my back and beat me with sticks,"" he said, lifting his shirt to show the scars lining his back. ""Each and every day they beat us to call our family and send money."" The new price for freedom: Around $2,000.

That was more than his family could scrape together. Boakye finally managed to escape. He worked small jobs for some time to save money, then tried to cross again. On his fourth try, he was picked up by the Ocean Viking humanitarian ship to be taken to Italy. In all, Boakye had paid $4,300 to get out of Libya.

Fathi al-Far, the head of the al-Nasr International Relief and Development agency, which operates at the center and has ties to the militia, denied that migrants are mistreated. He blamed ""misinformation"" on migrants who blew things out of proportion in an attempt to get asylum.

""I am not saying it's paradise -- we have people who have never worked before with the migrants, they are not trained,"" he said. But he called the al-Nasr Martyrs detention center ""the most beautiful in the country.""

At least five former detainees showed an AP journalist scars from their injuries at the center, which they said were inflicted by guards or ransom seekers making demands to their families. One man had bullet wounds to both feet, and another had cuts on his back from a sharp blade. All said they had to pay to get out.

Five to seven people are freed every day after they pay anywhere from $1,800 to $8,500 each, the former migrants said. At al-Nasr, they said, the militia gets around $14,000 every day from ransoms; at Tarek al-Sikka, a detention center in Tripoli, it was closer to $17,000 a day, they said. They based their estimates on what they and others detained with them had paid, by scraping together money from family and friends.

The militias also make money from selling groups of migrants, who then often simply disappear from a center. An analysis commissioned by the EU and released earlier this month by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime noted that the detention centers profit by selling migrants among themselves and to traffickers, as well as into prostitution and forced labor.

Hundreds of migrants this year who were intercepted at sea and taken to detention centers had vanished by the time international aid groups visited, according to Médecins Sans Frontières. There's no way to tell where they went, but MSF suspects they were sold to another detention center or to traffickers.

A former guard at the Khoms center acknowledged to the AP that migrants often were seized in large numbers by men armed with anti-aircraft guns and RPGs. He said he couldn't keep his colleagues from abusing the migrants or traffickers from taking them out of the center.

""I don't want to remember what happened,"" he said. The IOM was present at Khoms, he noted, but the center closed last year.

A man who remains detained at the al-Nasr Martyrs center said Libyans frequently arrive in the middle of the night to take people. Twice this fall, he said, they tried to load a group of mostly women into a small convoy of vehicles but failed because the center's detainees revolted.

Fighting engulfed Zawiya last week, but migrants remained locked inside the al-Nasr Martyrs center, which is also being used for weapons storage.

TRAFFICKING AND INTERCEPTION AT SEA

Even when migrants pay to be released from the detention centers, they are rarely free. Instead, the militias sell them to traffickers, who promise to take them across the Mediterranean to Europe for a further fee. These traffickers work hand in hand with some coast guard members, the AP found.

The Libyan coast guard is supported by both the UN and the EU. The IOM, the UN's agency for migration, highlights its cooperation with the coast guard on its Libya home page. Europe has spent more than 90 million euros since 2017 for training and faster boats for the Libyan coast guard to stop migrants from ending up in Europe.

This fall, Italy renewed a memorandum of understanding with Libya to support the coast guard with training and vessels, and it delivered 10 new speedboats to Libya in November.

In internal documents obtained in September by the European watchdog group Statewatch, the European Council described the coast guard as ""operating effectively, thus confirming the process achieved over the past three years."" The Libyan coast guard says it intercepted nearly 9,000 people in 2019 en route to Europe and returned them to Libya this year, after quietly extending its coastal rescue zone 100 miles offshore with European encouragement.

What's unclear is how often militias paid the coast guard to intercept these people and bring them back to the detention centers -- the business more than a dozen migrants described at the al-Nasr Martyrs facility in Zawiya.

The coast guard unit at Zawiya is commanded by Abdel-Rahman Milad, who has sanctions against him for human trafficking by the UN's Security Council. Yet when his men intercept boats carrying migrants, they contact UN staff at disembarkation points for cursory medical checks.

Despite the sanctions and an arrest warrant against him, Milad remains free because he has the support of the al-Nasr militia. In 2017, before the sanctions, Milad was even flown to Rome, along with a militia leader, Mohammed al-Khoja, as part of a Libyan delegation for a UN-sponsored migration meeting. In response to the sanctions, Milad denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men.

Migrants named at least two other operations along the coast, at Zuwara and Tripoli, that they said operated along the same lines as Milad's. Neither center responded to requests for comment.

The IOM, the UN migration agency, acknowledged to the AP that it has to work with partners who might have contacts with local militias.

""Without those contacts it would be impossible to operate in those areas and for IOM to provide support services to migrants and the local population,"" said Safa Msehli, the spokeswoman for the UN's International Organization for Migration. ""Failure to provide that support would have compounded the misery of hundreds of men, women and children.""

The story of Abdullah, a Sudanese man who made two attempts to flee Libya, shows just how lucrative the cycle of trafficking and interception really is.

All told, the group of 47 in his first crossing from Tripoli over a year ago had paid a uniformed Libyan and his cronies $127,000 in a mix of dollars, euros and Libyan dinars for the chance to leave their detention center and cross in two boats. They were intercepted in a coast guard boat by the same uniformed Libyan, shaken down for their cell phones and more money, and tossed back into detention.

""We talked to him and asked him, why did you let us out and then arrest us?"" said Abdullah, who asked that only his first name be used because he was afraid of retaliation. ""He beat two of us who brought it up.""

Abdullah later ended up in the al-Nasr Martyrs detention center, where he learned the new price list for release and an attempted crossing based on nationality: Ethiopians, $5,000; Somalis $6,800; Moroccans and Egyptians, $8,100; and finally Bangladeshis, a minimum $18,500. Across the board, women pay more.

Abdullah scraped together another ransom payment and another crossing fee. Last July, he and 18 others paid $48,000 in total for a boat with a malfunctioning engine that sputtered to a stop within hours.

After a few days stuck at sea off the Libyan coast under a sweltering sun, they threw a dead man overboard and waited for their own lives to end. Instead, they were rescued on their ninth day at sea by Tunisian fishermen, who took them back to Tunisia.

""There are only three ways out of the prison: You escape, you pay ransom, or you die,"" Abdullah said, referring to the detention center.

In all, Abdullah spent a total of $3,300 to leave Libya's detention centers and take to the sea. He ended up barely 100 miles away.

Sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the EU wants them to prevent: Letting migrants cross, according to Tarik Lamloum, the head of the Libyan human rights organization Beladi. Traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around $10,000 per boat that is allowed to pass, with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable, he said.

The head of Libya's Department for Combating Irregular Migration or DCIM, the agency responsible for the detention centers under the Ministry of Interior, acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers, and even within the government itself.

""They are in bed with them, as well as people from my own agency,"" said Al Mabrouk Abdel-Hafez.

SKIMMING PROFITS

Beyond the direct abuse of migrants, the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from EU funds sent for their food and security -- even those earmarked for a UN-run migrant center, according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in Libya and Tunisia, as well as internal UN emails and meeting minutes seen by The Associated Press.

An audit in May of the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency responsible for the center, found a lack of oversight and accountability at nearly all levels of spending in the Libya mission. The audit identified inexplicable payments in American dollars to Libyan firms and deliveries of goods that were never verified.

In December 2018, during the period reviewed in the audit, the UN launched its migrant center in Tripoli, known as the Gathering and Departure Facility or GDF, as an "" alternative to detention."" For the recipients of the services contracts, sent through the Libyan government agency Libaid, it was a windfall.

Millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to al-Khoja, the militia leader flown to Rome for the UN migration meeting, according to internal UN emails seen by the AP, two senior Libyan officials and an international aid worker. Al-Khoja is also the deputy head of the DCIM, the government agency responsible for the detention centers.

One of the Libyan officials saw the multimillion-euro catering contract with a company named Ard al-Watan, or The Land of the Nation, which al-Khoja controls.

""We feel like this is al-Khoja's fiefdom. He controls everything. He shuts the doors and he opens the doors,"" said the official, a former employee at the UN center who like other Libyan officials spoke anonymously out of fear for his safety. He said al-Khoja used sections of the UN center to train his militia fighters and built a luxury apartment inside.

Even as the contracts for the UN center were negotiated, Libyan officials said, three Libyan government agencies, including the prosecutor's office, were investigating al-Khoja in connection with the disappearance of $570 million from government spending allocated to feed migrants in detention centers in the west.

At the time, al-Khoja already ran another center for migrants, Tarik al-Sikka, notorious for abuses including beating, hard labor and a massive ransom scheme. Tekila, an Eritrean refugee, said that for two years at Tarik al-Sikka, he and other migrants lived on macaroni, even after he was among 25 people who came down with tuberculosis, a disease exacerbated by malnutrition. Tekila asked that only his first name be used for his safety.

""When there is little food, there is no choice but to go to sleep,"" he said.

Despite internal UN emails warning of severe malnutrition inside Tarik al-Sikka, UN officials in February and March 2018 repeatedly visited the detention center to negotiate the future opening of the GDF. AP saw emails confirming that by July 2018, the UNHCR's chief of mission was notified that companies controlled by al-Khoja's militia would receive subcontracts for services.

Yaxley, the spokesman for UNHCR, emphasized that the officials the UN refugee agency works with are ""all under the authority of the Ministry of Interior."" He said UNHCR monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed, and may withhold payments otherwise.

A senior official at LibAid, the Libyan government agency that managed the center with the UN, said the contracts are worth at least $7 million for catering, cleaning and security, and 30 out of the 65 LibAid staff were essentially ghost employees who showed up on the payroll, sight unseen.

The UN center was ""a treasure trove,"" the senior Libaid official lamented. ""There was no way you could operate while being surrounded by Tripoli militias. It was a big gamble.""

An internal UN memo from February 2019 shows it was aware of the problem. The memo found a high risk that food for the UN center was being diverted to militias, given the amount budgeted compared to the amount migrants were eating.

In general, around 50 dinars a day, or $35, is budgeted per detainee for food and other essentials for all centers, according to two Libyan officials, two owners of food catering companies and an international aid worker. Of that, only around 2 dinars is actually spent on meals, according to their rough calculations and migrants' descriptions.

Yaxley, the spokesman for the UNHCR, said the UN refugee agency monitors expenses to make sure its standard rules are followed, and may withhold payments otherwise. He also emphasized that the officials UNHCR works with are ""all under the authority of the Ministry of Interior.""

Despite the investigations into al-Khoja, Tarik al-Sikka and another detention center shared a 996,000-euro grant from the EU and Italy in February.

At the Zawiya center, emergency goods delivered by UN agencies ended up redistributed ""half for the prisoners, half for the workers,"" said Orobosa Bright, a Nigerian who endured three stints there for a total of 11 months. Many of the goods end up on Libya's black market as well, Libyan officials and international aid workers say.

Despite the corruption, the detention system in Libya is still expanding in places, with money from Europe. At a detention center in Sabaa where migrants are already going hungry, they were forced to build yet another wing funded by the Italian government, said Lamloum, the Libyan aid worker. The Italian government did not respond to a request for comment.

Lamloum sent a photo of the new prison. It has no windows.

TUNISIA LAUNDERING

The money earned off the suffering of migrants is whitewashed in money laundering operations in Tunisia, Libya's neighbor.

In the town of Ben Gardane, dozens of money-changing stalls transform Libyan dinars, dollars and euros into Tunisian currency before the money continues on its way to the capital, Tunis. Even Libyans without residency can open a bank account.

Tunisia also offers another opportunity for militia networks to make money off European funds earmarked for migrants. Because of Libya's dysfunctional banking system, where cash is scarce and militias control accounts, international organizations give contracts, usually in dollars, to Libyan organizations with bank accounts in Tunisia. The vendors compound the money the money on Libya's black-market exchange, which ranges between 4 and 9 times greater than the official rate.

Libya's government handed over more than 100 files to Tunisia earlier this year listing companies under investigation for fraud and money laundering.

The companies largely involve militia warlords and politicians, according to Nadia Saadi, a manager at the Tunisian anti-corruption authority. The laundering involves cash payments for real estate, falsified customs documents and faked bills for fictitious companies.

""All in all, Libya is run by militias,"" said a senior Libyan judicial official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of risking his life. ""Whatever governments say, and whatever uniform they wear, or stickers they put....this is the bottom line.""

Husni Bey, a prominent businessman in Libya, said the idea of Europe sending aid money to Libya, a once-wealthy country suffering from corruption, was ill-conceived from the beginning.

""Europe wants to buy those who can stop smuggling with all of these programs,"" Bey said. ""They would be much better off blacklisting the names of those involved in human trafficking, fuel and drug smuggling and charging them with crimes, instead of giving them money.""

11403355,2019-12-14,"CAIRO (AP) -- Just two days after rebel Libyan commander Khalifa Hifter declared a ""final"" and decisive battle for the capital Tripoli, heavy fighting raged for a 24-hour period between his troops and militias loosely allied with the internationally backed government based in the city, officials said Saturday.

The fighting came after Hifter, the leader of the self-styled Libyan National Army, said Thursday that the ""zero hour"" of his battle for Tripoli had begun, nearly eight months after he began an offensive to take the city from the country's Government of National accord supported by the U.N.

The LNA's media office shared images of reinforcements arriving in Tripoli, including ground troops and pickup trucks with mounted machine guns and of clashes in southern parts of the city. Hifter's forces took control of the town of al-Tawghaar, just south of Tripoli, the LNA said. But Tripoli-based forces disputed that claim.

The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into another bout of violence rivaling the scale of the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

In the chaos that followed Gadhafi's death, the country was divided into two parts -- a weak U.N.-supported administration in Tripoli and a rival government in the east aligned with the LNA.

The LNA's media office said it shot down a Turkish-made drone over the town of Ain Zara south of the capital. Hifter forces captured a major military camp from the Tripoli-allied militias and clashes continued around the camp, officials from both sides said.

The LNA also launched airstrikes overnight against an air base at the Air Force Academy in the city of Misrata, targeting military warehouses allegedly housing Turkish-made drones used by Tripoli-allied militias, said LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mesmari.

Misrata, in western Libya, is the country's second largest city and is home to fierce militias who oppose Hifter and have been extremely important in the government's defense of Tripoli.

There was heavy fighting elsewhere around Tripoli in the new push by Hifter's forces and officials on both sides said the latest offensive has been more intense than Hifter's other offensives over the past eight months.

Since his troops marched toward Tripoli in April, Hifter has only been able to lay siege to the city, failing to claim it from the government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

In past months, battle lines have barely changed, with both sides dug in and shelling each other in the southern capital's reaches. Both sides have also sought support from regional and international backers.

U.N. experts said in a 376-page report to the U.N. Security Council this week that Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are supporting Libya's warring sides and have ""routinely and sometimes blatantly supplied weapons, with little effort to disguise the source"" in violation of a U.N. arms embargo.

Hifter is backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, France and Russia. The Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

Libyan and U.S. officials have accused Russia of deploying fighters through a private security contractor, the Wagner Group, to key Libyan battleground areas in recent months.

While Moscow has repeatedly denied any role in the fighting in Libya, the Government of National Accord said it has documented between 600 and 800 Russian fighters in Libya fighting with Hifter forces.

""The Russian fighters' toughness, lethal techniques and coordination discipline have instilled fear in the anti-Hifter forces,"" said Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya expert at The Netherlands Institute of International Relations. ""Now, Hifter and all foreign states backing him have become dramatically more confident that Hifter's brigades will enter Tripoli within the foreseeable future.""

The U.N. experts' report also said the presence of Chadian and Sudanese fighters in Libya ""has become more marked"" in 2019 and said they represent ""a direct threat"" to the country's security and stability.

Hifter's declaration of his most recent offensive came after the signing of a security arrangement and maritime deal between Sarraj's government and Turkey last month.

The maritime deal would give Turkey access to a Mediterranean Sea economic zone offshore from Libya. Cyprus, Egypt and Greece claim the accord violates international law.

The deal has also added tension to Turkey's ongoing dispute with Greece, Cyprus and Egypt over oil and gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean.",AP,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Misrata', 'Cairo', 'Zadar', 'Russia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Moscow', 'United States', 'Turkey', 'Qatar', 'Netherlands', 'Jordan', 'Italy', 'France', 'Egypt', 'Chad', 'Sudan', 'Greece', 'Cyprus']",Fighting rages near Libya's capital in push by rebel army,https://apnews.com/7c211c759fda2d7a9add060bd8eb00c7,None,
11403356,2019-04-29,"CAIRO (AP) -- Libyan forces loyal to a former military commander have intensified their airstrikes on Tripoli, where heavy fighting and blocked roads have left civilians trapped in their homes, officials said Monday.

Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter's self-styled Libyan National Army launched an operation to retake the capital on April 4 and has been locked in heavy fighting in and around the city with militias loosely allied with a U.N.-supported government. The clashes have killed more than 270 people, including 21 civilians, according to the latest U.N. figures released last week.

Libyan officials said LNA airstrikes have targeted the Nawasi Brigade in the Abu Salim district, about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from Tripoli's center. At least four civilians were killed, they said.

They said airstrikes hit al-Qaqaa military camp in the town of al-Falah, south of Tripoli. The camp is controlled by powerful militias from the western town of Misrata that are also allied with the Tripoli government. Airstrikes and shelling also hit the towns of Khallet al-Forjan, Ain Zara and al-Twaisha, south of the capital, and heavy fighting was underway in Salah al-Deen, an area that saw earlier clashes between rival militias in September.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.

Residents said fighting has been ongoing overnight in residential areas a few kilometers (miles) south of Tripoli. Both sides have used heavy artillery and airstrikes, they said.

""We cannot move because of the shelling from both sides. Our homes have been damaged. We are trying to leave the area to a safer place,"" said Mohammed al-Trapoulsi, a 41-year-old father of three from Abu Salim.

On Sunday, LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mosmari told a news conference in the eastern city of Benghazi that their warplanes targeted the Yarmuk military camp in Ain Zara. The two sides have traded control the strategic camp since the offensive began.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Sunday the clashes have displaced more than 41,000 people. It said the fighting, along with random shelling, roadblocks and roadside bombs, prevented many civilians from moving to safer areas and hindered efforts to evacuate them or deliver aid.

Hifter, a veteran general who has spent the last few years battling Islamic extremists and rival factions in eastern Libya, says he is determined to restore stability to Libya, which slid into chaos after longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown and killed in 2011. His opponents view him as an aspiring autocrat and fear a return to one-man rule.

Since launching his offensive in Tripoli, Hifter's forces have captured the districts of Gharyan and Qasr Bani Ghashir, along with several smaller towns. They also seized the capital's airport, which was heavily damaged and shut down after an earlier bout of fighting between rival militias in 2014.

Hifter is allied with civilian authorities based in the eastern town of Tobruk and has received support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and France. The U.N. supports the government in Tripoli and has called for an immediate cease-fire and the organization of national elections.

Elsewhere in Libya, Hifter's forces repelled an attack on the Sharara oil field in the country's southwest. Libya's National Oil Corporation condemned the overnight the attack, saying production ""remains unaffected."" It was not clear who was behind the attack.

Hifter's forces captured the oil field in February and allowed the NOC, which has remained neutral in the conflict, to resume operations there.

The NOC said Sunday that its monthly oil revenues increased by 20% to more than $1.5 billion in March after resuming production from Sharara, which produces around 300,000 barrels a day. The field is operated by the NOC in partnership with a consortium that includes Total, Repsol, Statoil, and OMV.

11403664,2019-12-05,"TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- Officials in Libya's U.N.-supported government say they plan to confront Moscow over the alleged deployment of Russian mercenaries fighting alongside their opponents in the country's civil war.

Libyan and U.S. officials accuse Russia of deploying fighters through a private security contractor, the Wagner Group, to key battleground areas in Libya in the past months.

They say the Russian fighters are backing commander Khalifa Hifter, whose forces have been trying for months to capture the capital Tripoli. The U.N.-supported Government of National Accord is based in Tripoli.

The GNA has documented between 600 to 800 Russian fighters in Libya and is collecting their names in a list to present to the Russian government, according to Khaled al-Meshri, the head of the Tripoli-based government's Supreme Council of State.

""We are going to visit Russia after we collect all evidence and present to the authorities and see what they say,"" al-Meshri told The Associated Press last week. He did not say when that visit would take place.

Moscow has repeatedly denied playing any role in Libya's fighting.

Hifter's self-styled Libyan National Army -- made up of army units, ultraconservative Salafists, and tribesmen -- launched its offensive on Tripoli in April after seizing much of eastern Libya from Islamic militants and other rivals in recent years. Hifter is backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia, while the Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

Libya was plunged into chaos when a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The country is now split between a government in the east, allied with Hifter, and the GNA in Tripoli in the west. Both sides are bolstered by militias. Fighting has stalled in recent weeks, with both sides dug in and shelling one another along Tripoli's southern reaches.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs David Schenker told reporters last week that the State Department is working with European partners to impose sanctions on the Russian military contractor responsible for sending fighters to Tripoli.

""The way that this organization of Russians in particular has operated before raises the specter of large-scale casualties in civilian populations,"" he said.

Schenker's comments came shortly after U.S. officials met with Hifter to press for a cease-fire and ""expressed serious concern"" over Russia's intervention in the conflict.

But President Donald Trump has sent decidedly mixed messages to Hifter.

Trump voiced support of Hifter when he launched his attempt to take over Tripoli, praising the commanders ""anti-terrorism"" efforts in a phone conversation. The call was a sharp break with the U.S. policy of supporting Libya's Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj.

Hifter's offensive dealt a blow to U.N. efforts to bring warring parties together. Al-Meshri called for confidence-building measures and a push toward presidential and parliamentary elections.

""Since Gadhafi's ouster, there have been no presidential elections. People are fed up,"" he said.

The Russians' presence has further mired an already complex conflict.

Al-Meshri maintains his administration has strong evidence that there are Russians fighters on the ground.

He says that government forces have found cell phones, intercepted communications and seized personal belongings left behind in the chaos of battle. He said flight data show dates and names of Russians moving from Syria to Egypt and then the Jordanian capital of Amman before flying to the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, Hifter's seat of power. He didn't elaborate or present any of these documents or items to the AP.

Wagner Group is believed to have sent mercenaries to multiple conflicts, including Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere, raising accusations that Moscow is using it to spread its influence. The firm is a military contractor run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin. Russian officials have refused in the past to comment on the firm's activities.

By deploying fighters into Libya, Russia is embroiling itself in another conflict in the Middle East. Russia's military is involved in Syria's civil war, conducting airstrikes and deploying troops and military police. That operation successfully shored up Syrian President Bashar Assad's government and -- at a relatively modest cost -- helped Moscow expand its clout in the region.

Analysts believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to find leverage with Western powers in oil-rich Libya. They say he also recognizes that the country is a gateway for many migrants trying to reach European shores.

""Most of this is smoke and mirrors designed to induce fear,"" said Anas Gamati, founder of the Tripoli-based Sadeq Institute. ""Russian influence has done only two things: inflate their size and specter of their power in Libya. They're not positively engaged or trying to play a constructive role with diplomatic or political value.""

Officially, Russia continues to maintain a dialogue with both sides. Hifter has visited Moscow several times the past years, and al-Meshri was part of a GNA delegation that met with Putin during a Russia-Africa summit in Sochi in March.

The allegations of Russian interference come amid a renewed push for international players to reach a consensus on Libya.

Germany is working with the United Nations to host a conference on Libya by early 2020. Observers hope that international players could exert enough pressure to stop the fighting.

But others worry that Hifter's appetite for territory and power might prove too large. Former GNA defense minister Mahdi al-Barghathi, who left in the government in July, says the only way toward peace is for Hifter to be left with no powerful friends, and no other options. Otherwise, al-Barghathi said Hifter will be set to become another Gadhafi.

""We don't want to go back to square one,"" he said.

As long as international powers remain divided, Libya's conflict risks continuing to play out as the world's latest proxy war, some observers warn.

""Putin would like nothing more than to keep Europe busy and divided over Libya, scared of illegal immigration, paralyzed by right-wing populism that threatens the very idea of the EU,"" said Mohammed Eljareh, an analyst who runs Libya Outlook, a consulting company on Libyan affairs.

11403673,2019-12-02,"CAIRO (AP) -- An airstrike that hit a civilian area in a southern neighborhood of the Libyan capital killed at least four children, the country's health ministry said Monday.

Tripoli has been the scene of fighting since April between the self-styled Libyan National Army, led by Gen. Khalifa Hifter, and an array of militias loosely allied with the U.N.-supported but weak government, which holds Tripoli.

It wasn't immediately who was behind the Sunday airstrike on the al-Sawani neighborhood, about 30 kilometers, or 18 miles, from the city center but the Libyan interior ministry blamed the Libyan National Army. The force did not return calls seeking comment.

The health ministry spokesman Malek Merset said a fifth child was wounded in the attack and shared graphic photographs of lifeless bodies and an image of a wounded child, purportedly from the attack.

The fighting for Tripoli has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands. It has stalled in recent months, with both sides dug in and shelling one another along the city's southern reaches.

Libya descended into chaos after the 2011 civil war that ousted and killed long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi. It is now split into rival governments, the U.N.-supported government based in Tripoli, which controls some of the country's west, and the east-based government aligned with Hifter that controls the east. Each is backed by militias and armed groups fighting over resources and territory.

In a political development, the Libyan parliament, which is based in the east and affiliated with the east-based government, called on Monday on the U.N. to withdraw its recognition of the Tripoli-based government.

The move appeared prompted by the parliament's outrage over a maritime and security cooperation deal last week between the Tripoli-based government and Turkey.

The parliament has denounced the agreement, signed by Libya's Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as a ""flagrant breach"" of the country's security and sovereignty. It said the deal grants the Turkish government the right to use Libyan airspace and waters as well as build military bases on Libyan soil.

The parliament speaker, Ogila Saleh, said in a four-page letter to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres that the agreement amounts to Turkish ""occupation of Libyan territory and the violation of its sovereignty. Saleh also said the deal ignores the fact that Turkey has no maritime border with Libya, but that Greece and Cyprus have them.

Greece and Cyprus, along with Egypt, which backs Hifter, have criticized the agreement, calling it a serious breach of international law.

11403674,2019-12-01,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's prime minister said Sunday he will ask other NATO members at the alliance's London summit to support Greece in the face of fellow member Turkey's attempts to encroach on Greek sovereignty, notably last week's agreement with Libya delineating maritime borders in the Mediterranean.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis told the ruling conservative New Democracy party's congress Sunday that NATO can't remain indifferent when one of its members ""blatantly violates international law"" and that a neutral approach is to the detriment of Greece, which has never sought to ratchet up tensions in the area.

Cyprus, Egypt and Greece have all condemned the Libyan-Turkish accord as contrary to international law. The foreign ministers of Egypt and Greece, Sameh Shoukry and Nikos Dendias, discussed the issue Sunday in Cairo.

Spokesman Ahmed Hafez said in a statement after the meeting that the two ministers agreed that the Turkey-Libya deal was ""illegal"" and that Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj doesn't have the right to sign memorandums with other countries outside (the scope of) the U.N.-brokered deal that established his government.

""We agreed that that Mr. Sarraj most likely lacks the mandate to sign (two agreements with Turkey), which anyway function as destabilizing factors in the area,"" Dendias said after the meeting. ""We also agreed with (Shoukry) to accelerate talks between teams of experts to define and delineate Exclusive Economic Zones between Greece and Egypt,"" Dendias added.

While Greece and Egypt are across from each other in the Mediterranean Sea, as are Greece and Turkey, Libya is geographically further from Turkey and the waters between the two countries are mostly those between Greece and Egypt.

The Turkey-Libya deal added tension to an ongoing dispute with Greece, Cyprus and Egypt over oil-and-gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean.

Turkey doesn't recognize Cyprus as a state -- but does recognize the breakaway Turkish Cypriot entity, the only country to do so -- and is conducting exploratory gas drilling in waters where the ethnically divided island nation has exclusive economic rights.

11403877,2019-12-31,"When the European Union started funneling millions of euros into Libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the Mediterranean, the money came with EU promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking.

Instead, the misery of migrants in Libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the EU and enabled by the United Nations, an Associated Press investigation has found. The investigation was based on interviews with more than 50 migrants, Libyan government officials and aid workers; internal UN emails, and budget documents and contracts.

- Huge sums of European money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen, traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants. In some cases, UN officials knew militia networks were getting the money, according to internal emails.

- The militias torture, extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the UN, often in compounds that receive millions in European money. Many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers, sold to traffickers or to other centers.

- The militias conspire with some members of Libyan coast guard units. The coast guard gets training and equipment from Europe to keep migrants away. But coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias and receive bribes to let others pass en route to Europe.

- The militias skim off European funds given through the UN to feed and otherwise help migrants, who go hungry. For example, millions of euros in UN food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader, even as other UN teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center, according to internal UN emails and interviews with at least a half-dozen Libyan officials.

- In many cases, the money goes to neighboring Tunisia to be laundered, and then flows back to the militias in Libya.

- The EU's own documents show it was aware of the dangers of effectively outsourcing its migration crisis to Libya. Budget documents from as early as 2017 for a 90 million euro outlay warned of a medium-to-high risk that Europe's support would only lead to more human rights violations.

Despite the roles they play in the detention system, both the EU and the UN say they want the centers closed. The EU said that under international law, it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers, and that it relies on the UN to spend European money for Libya wisely.

11403880,2019-01-21,"CAIRO (AP) -- Mohamed Ben Khalifa's work as a photographer and video journalist captured the tragedy of refugee corpses washing ashore on Libya's coastline. In urban centers, he documented ferocious militia warfare.

In one photo, a wave rolls gently over the arm of a dead refugee. In another, a love letter written on pink paper is seen next to the body of a Syrian refugee found on the beach of Ben Khalifa's hometown of Zuwara, west of the Libyan capital. In others, gunfire rages, lighting up the night sky.

The work of Ben Khalifa, who was killed in Libya on Saturday, reflected Libya's post-2011 chaos of rival militias fighting for control as well as the humanitarian tragedy of waves of people fleeing North Africa, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.

He was killed on Saturday while accompanying a militia on patrol in southern Tripoli. The group came under fire and attack by a missile, according to a fellow freelance journalist. Ben Khalifa was killed by shrapnel.

His body of work since 2014 for the AP included more than 260 photos and scores of videos. A freelancer, he also contributed to other news organizations.

""The Associated Press is distraught by the death of freelance photographer Mohamed Ben Khalifa, who had contributed important, impactful photos from Libya to AP since 2014. Our thoughts are with his family, especially his wife and young daughter, and we offer our deepest condolences,"" said AP's Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and Ian Phillips, the news agency's vice president for international news.

""It is heartbreaking any time a journalist is killed on the job. AP works closely with its freelance and staff journalists to try to ensure their safety. The safety of journalists everywhere is paramount, especially those who are working in the most dangerous of places,"" they said in a statement.

Ben Khalifa, 35, also covered routine stories, such as visits by diplomats trying to negotiate a peace deal for Libya. The country splintered in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising and civil war that led to the ouster and killing of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

With his sharp eye for detail, Ben Khalifa captured the attempts by ordinary Libyans to carve out normal lives amid the turmoil of the past decade. In one photo, a little boy in a traditional embroidered jacket looks at Ben Khalifa's camera, facing away from rows of male worshippers sitting in Tripoli's Martyrs' Square for Muslim holiday prayers. Another shows a wedding ceremony.

But violence was a constant theme in Ben Khalifa's work, A 2018 photo showed the damage caused by a suicide bombing at Libya's election commission. A photo taken in late December showed the aftermath of a suicide attack on Libya's Foreign Ministry.

Ben Khalifa is survived by his wife, Lamya, and their 7-month-old daughter, Rayan.

11403904,2019-12-31,"TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- When the European Union funneled millions of euros into Libya to slow the tide of migrants crossing the Mediterranean, the money came with EU promises to improve detention centers notorious for abuse and fight human trafficking.

That hasn't happened. Instead, the misery of migrants in Libya has spawned a thriving and highly lucrative web of businesses funded in part by the EU and enabled by the United Nations, an Associated Press investigation has found.

The EU has sent more than 327.9 million euros to Libya, with an additional 41 million approved in early December, largely funneled through UN agencies. The AP found that in a country without a functioning government, huge sums of European money have been diverted to intertwined networks of militiamen, traffickers and coast guard members who exploit migrants. In some cases, UN officials knew the money was going to militia networks, according to internal emails.

The militias torture, extort and otherwise abuse migrants for ransoms in detention centers under the nose of the UN, often in compounds that receive millions in European money, the AP investigation showed. Many migrants also simply disappear from detention centers, sold to traffickers or to other centers.

The same militias conspire with some members of Libyan coast guard units. The coast guard gets training and equipment from Europe to keep migrants away from its shores. But coast guard members return some migrants to the detention centers under deals with militias, the AP found, and receive bribes to let others pass en route to Europe.

The militias involved in abuse and trafficking also skim off European funds given through the UN to feed and otherwise help migrants, who go hungry. For example, millions of euros in UN food contracts were under negotiation with a company controlled by a militia leader, even as other UN teams raised alarms about starvation in his detention center, according to emails obtained by the AP and interviews with at least a half-dozen Libyan officials.

In many cases, the money goes to neighboring Tunisia to be laundered, and then flows back to the militias in Libya.

The story of Prudence Aimée shows how migrants are exploited at every stage of their journey through Libya.

Aimée left Cameroon in 2015, and when her family heard nothing from her for over a year, they thought she was dead. But she was in detention and incommunicado. In nine months at the Abu Salim detention center, she saw ""European Union milk"" and diapers delivered by UN staff pilfered before they could reach migrant children, including her toddler son. Aimée herself would spend two days at a time without food or drink.

Her family paid two ransoms for her, and she finally got on a boat that made it past the coast guard patrol, after her husband paid $850 for her passage. She was rescued by a European aid ship.

Aimée was one of more than 50 migrants interviewed by the AP at sea, in Europe, Tunisia and Rwanda, and in furtive messages from inside detention centers in Libya. Journalists also spoke with Libyan government officials, aid workers and businessmen in Tripoli, obtained internal emails and analyzed budget documents and contracts.

The issue of migration has convulsed Europe since the influx of more than a million people in 2015 and 2016, fleeing violence and poverty in the Mideast, Afghanistan and Africa. In 2015, the European Union set up a fund intended to curb migration from Africa, from which money is sent to Libya.

But Libya is plagued by corruption and caught in a civil war. The west, including the capital Tripoli, is ruled by a UN-brokered government, while the east is ruled by another government supported by army commander Khalifa Hifter. The chaos is ideal for profiteers making money off migrants.

Despite the role they play in Libya's detention system, both the EU and the UN say they want the centers closed. In a statement to the AP, the EU said that under international law, it is not responsible for what goes on inside the centers.

""Libyan authorities have to provide the detained refugees and migrants with adequate and quality food while ensuring that conditions in detention centers uphold international agreed standards,"" the statement said.

The UN said it has to work with whoever runs the detention centers to preserve access to vulnerable migrants.

""UNHCR does not choose its counterparts,"" said Charlie Yaxley, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, one of the main UN agencies in Libya. ""While these officials are employed by the Ministry of Interior......some presumably also have allegiances with local militias.""

After two weeks of being questioned by the AP, UNHCR said it would change its policy on awarding food and aid contracts for migrants through intermediaries.

""Due in part to the escalating conflict in Tripoli and the possible risk to the integrity of UNHCR's programme, UNHCR decided to contract directly for these services from 1 January 2020,"" Yaxley said.

The militia networks make money directly from the abuse of migrants, torturing them and sometimes sending families videos to raise ransom payments. They also work hand in hand with traffickers and some coast guard members, the AP found.

Sometimes members of the coast guard make money by doing exactly what the EU wants them to prevent: Letting migrants cross, according to Tarik Lamloum, the head of the Libyan human rights organization Beladi. Traffickers pay the coast guard a bribe of around $10,000 per boat that is allowed to pass, with around five to six boats launching at a time when conditions are favorable, he said.

The head of Libya's Department for Combating Irregular Migration or DCIM, the agency responsible for the detention centers under the Ministry of Interior, acknowledged corruption and collusion among the militias and the coast guard and traffickers, and even within the government itself.

""They are in bed with them, as well as people from my own agency,"" said Al Mabrouk Abdel-Hafez.

Beyond the direct abuse of migrants, the militia network also profits by siphoning off money from EU funds sent for their food and security -- even those earmarked for a UN-run migrant center, according to more than a dozen officials and aid workers in Libya and Tunisia, as well as internal UN emails and meeting minutes seen by The Associated Press.

Millions of euros in contracts for food and migrant aid went to at least one company linked to Mohammed al-Khoja, a militia leader flown to Rome in 2017 for a UN migration meeting, according to internal UN emails seen by the AP, two senior Libyan officials and an international aid worker. Al-Khoja is also the deputy head of the DCIM, the government agency responsible for the detention centers.

One of the Libyan officials saw a multimillion-euro catering contract with a company named Ard al-Watan, or The Land of the Nation, which al-Khoja controls.

At the time the contract was under negotiation, al-Khoja already ran another center for migrants, Tarik al-Sikka, notorious for abuses including beating, hard labor and a massive ransom scheme. UN emails showed migrants were suffering from severe malnutrition and a tuberculosis outbreak.

11403906,2019-12-30,"There has been no shortage of big news over the last decade. Spanning the globe, some stories were expected while others caught the world off guard. Some were so massive they were visible from space, captured through state-of-the-art imaging satellites belonging to technology company and imagery provider Maxar Technologies. Together, The Associated Press and Maxar assembled a selection of the most striking images.

For much of the decade that began in 2010, hurricanes with winds of 111 mph or more flirted with Florida and other parts the United States, but never made landfall. In fact, not one major hurricane hit the U.S. between 2006 and 2016. Colorado State University hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach called it ""an amazing streak of luck.""

Then came 2017. Three powerful hurricanes -- Harvey, Irma and Maria -- slammed into different parts of the country, causing $265 billion damage in four weeks.

""We set an alarming number of hurricane records in 2017,"" MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel said.

Harvey parked itself over Houston and unleashed a downpour. It killed 68 people and set a U.S. record for amount of rain recorded from a storm: 60.58 inches. Harvey's $120 billion in damages ranks as the second-costliest U.S. storm behind only Katrina in 2005.

Hurricane Irma came next and stayed at maximum Category 5 strength for the longest time ever recorded. Irma was the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic, and it devastated the Caribbean and plowed into Florida. Irma's $50 billion in damages ranks fifth.

The most devastating came last: Hurricane Maria leveled parts of Puerto Rico. Experts still can't agree on how many people died, with some estimates in the thousands. Maria was America's third-costliest storm at $90 billion.

America's biggest offshore oil spill began with an explosion that killed 11 people. It happened April 20, 2010, on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which was extracting oil for BP. The rig sank two days later on the 40th anniversary of Earth Day. For 87 excruciating days, oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico as people including oil engineers, a Nobel winning scientist and actor Kevin Costner came up with plans to plug the leak that left a bathtub-like ring of coagulated oil on the seafloor.

A team of scientists calculated that 172 million gallons spilled into the Gulf. BP said the number was closer to 100 million gallons, and a federal judge ruled that 134 million gallons had spilled. The case languished in court until April 2016, when a federal judge approved a $20 billion settlement, ruling that BP had been ""grossly negligent.""

By then, the surface of the Gulf of Mexico had no visible scars. Beaches and marshes looked oil-free and back to normal.

However, scientists noticed an increase in dolphin deaths, which had averaged 63 a year before the spill. After the spill, they hit 335 in 2011 and averaged 200 a year for five years. Biologists also reported far fewer numbers of endangered Kemp Ripley sea turtles for years after.

Earth's glaciers have shrunk by about 3,860 billion tons (3,500 billion metric tons) this decade, according to research by Michael Zemp at the World Glacier Monitoring Service. That's about 924 trillion gallons of melted ice and snow -- enough to cover the United States in water 14 inches (35.6 centimeters) deep.

Glaciers in Greenland, including the Petermann, started the decade losing about 54 billion tons (51 billion metric tons) of ice a year. It slowed to about 37 billion tons (34 billion metric tons) in 2018 before speeding up again in 2019. Glaciers in the Southern Andes lost about 37 billion tons (34 billion metric tons) a year in the early part of the decade, and by 2018 they were losing nearly 47 billion tons (42.5 billion metric tons) a year.

""The last decade has been devastating for Earth's glaciers and ice sheets, and unlike anything modern humanity has seen before,"" ice scientist Twila Moon of the National Snow and Ice Data Center said in an email. ""Communities have lost drinking, agriculture and hydropower resources as small glaciers have in some instances completely disappeared. Sea level rise from ice loss across the globe has increased flooding, coastal erosion, and health and safety problems, impacting people's lives, communities, and economies.""

In August 2017, Myanmar's military launched a brutal, sweeping crackdown against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, burning villages, methodically raping women and girls, and killing thousands, including children. Human-rights groups have described the assault as a calculated campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide designed to drive the Rohingya from the Buddhist-majority country.

The bloodshed forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, where traumatized survivors crowded onto a stretch of low, rolling hills that would be transformed into the world's largest refugee camp.

That is where they have languished for more than two years in cramped, squalid conditions amid a maze of bamboo-and-tarp shelters that do little to protect them from monsoon rains and stifling heat. Along with fury and fear, a sense of futility swept through the camps as the survivors' pleas for justice went unheeded despite an international outcry over Myanmar's actions.

In November, the Rohingya were given reason to hope: Myanmar was accused of genocide at the United Nations' highest court. In December, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi appeared before the International Court of Justice to defend her nation's army from the allegations, arguing that the Rohingya people's exodus was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.

The African nation of Gambia brought the case against Myanmar on behalf of the 57-country Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

Looking down from space on Nov. 9, 2018, the outskirts of Paradise, California, glowed like burning coal. Hundreds of homes appeared as tiny embers. Entire neighborhoods blazed like bonfires.

The scope of the worst wildfire in California history hits home when seen from 300 miles above Earth.

What happened in Paradise has become a cautionary tale about the kind of devastation that is possible when erratic winds carry sparks across a warming planet.

Eighty-five people died. Some perished in cars on roads so choked by traffic they couldn't outrun the flames. Roughly 19,000 homes, businesses and other buildings were destroyed.

The state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., was blamed for the fire -- one of dozens of blazes its equipment has caused in recent years -- and forced into bankruptcy. A grim new reality emerged: widespread preemptive blackouts to stop power lines from sparking new blazes. Lawmakers approved hundreds of millions of dollars for firefighting and aggressive brush clearing to protect communities.

The fire has not led to limits on construction in especially fire-prone rural and mountainous terrain, where homes are more affordable. During a severe state housing shortage, a new Paradise is rising from the ashes.

The Islamic State group emerged in 2014 during chaotic conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The militants seized towns and cities, quickly gaining control of one-third of both countries. IS created what no other extremist group had before: a so-called Islamic caliphate, with the Syrian city of Raqqa as its capital. Thousands of foreign fighters converged there, and the militants ruled over the local population with a mix of terror and rewards. They levied taxes and extorted the local population. They smuggled oil and collected ransoms, making IS one of the richest militant groups to ever exist.

The group also plotted and executed attacks in the West. It produced thousands of slick online propaganda videos and recruited supporters around the world.

In response to the threat, a military campaign by a U.S.-led international coalition slowly chipped away at the group's territory. The militants made their last stand in March 2019 in a tiny Syrian village on the border with Iraq.

Even though IS has lost most of its territory, the group remains a threat in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and beyond. Its shadowy leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a U.S. airstrike on his hideout in Syria in October. But a successor was named, and pledges of allegiance came in from militants in Asia and Africa. Thousands of IS supporters and family members from all over the world, including children, are imprisoned in Syria.

A young Tunisian fruit vendor, frustrated at what he said was a system that trapped him and others in dire poverty, set himself on fire in December 2010. His death spurred calls for demonstrations throughout the region and started a movement that spread though social media and satellite TV.

People took to the streets with varying degrees of success, and the months that followed became known as ""The Arab Spring."" Protests reached fever pitch in Libya, Egypt, Syria and Yemen.

Calls for basic human rights, the departure of autocratic leaders and a way out of the poverty and unemployment for much of the region's youth were central to demonstrators' demands. But the movements were decentralized and lacked clear leadership. Still, they generated enough momentum to topple longtime presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia.

In Libya, Sudan and Yemen, the uprisings laid bare existing divisions in society that sparked civil wars that continue to this day. In Egypt, pro-democracy demonstrators saw their gains reversed by a military-backed government that brutally suppressed dissent. In Syria, the government's attempt to quash the protests led to years of civil war that devastated much of the country, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and uprooted millions. Tunisia remains the movement's tentative success story, with a peaceful post-uprising transition and democratic elections.

Almost 10 years later, the region is experiencing a second wave of protests in countries that missed out the first time around. Earlier this year, demonstrations in Sudan and Algeria pushed out presidents after decades in power. In Iraq and Lebanon, protesters are calling for an overhaul of the political system.

A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and giant tsunami struck the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Japan on March 11, 2011, causing its key cooling systems to fail, resulting in the meltdown of three reactors and spreading radiation into surrounding communities and out at sea.

Concerns about radiation at one point displaced about 160,000 people, splitting many families and communities. More than 40,000 still have not been allowed back.

The plant has since been stabilized and is being decommissioned, and officials say that could take decades. Removing the estimated 800 tons of melted debris and cleaning up the complex is an unprecedented challenge, some experts say. If or when the task can be done remains in question.

The scrutiny that followed revealed poor risk management practices by the government and plant operators and shed light on the lack of safety measures, prompting the public's distrust and contributing to widespread anti-nuclear sentiment. Japan temporarily shut down all reactors for safety checks and introduced stricter safety standards. The approvals take time, and a handful of reactors have since been restarted.

The Fukushima disaster has chilled the nuclear industry around the world. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe still promotes nuclear energy as a key component of the nation's energy mix, but the government had to largely abandon plans for nuclear plant exports and business overseas.

Across the sprawling and strategic South China Sea, nearly 70 disputed islands, reefs and atolls are occupied by five claimants. China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia have built airstrips, harbors, barracks and other infrastructure for both civilian and military use. Only China has created new islands by piling sand and concrete atop coral reefs.

That has upset the balance of power in the region, strengthening China's claim to the entire waterway. It also has further harmed the fragile environment already threatened by overfishing, pollution and the harvesting of giant clams by Chinese fishermen.

Starting in 2013, China began dredging sand on a massive scale to build its seven new island outposts, creating 3,200 acres (1,295 hectares) of dry land.

Fiery Cross Reef is among the most extensively developed, boasting large facilities for aircraft, missile batteries and marine forces. Whether or not these islands make a difference remains to be seen, however. Not only are they exposed to the marine environment, but as Japan learned in World War II, holding and supplying remote marine outposts during a conflict can be a tricky proposition, particularly in a region where Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, the U.S. and others have shown a willingness to defend their own interests; territorial, economic and otherwise.",AP,energy,,"['Florida', 'United States', 'Syria', 'Myanmar', 'Paradise, Nevada', 'Houston', 'Dolphin', 'Tunisia', 'Puerto Rico', 'Libya', 'Iraq', 'The Gambia', 'Greenland', 'Egypt', 'Bangladesh']",Looking down on a decade: Satellite images tell the stories,https://apnews.com/a33aafd9e1a64d5afdc46d3695b27ef8,None,
11403908,2019-09-22,"ABOARD THE OCEAN VIKING (AP) -- A ship carrying 182 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean Sea said Sunday that Italy has granted permission for its passengers to disembark in Sicily.

Italy's decision to take in the Ocean Viking comes ahead of a meeting in Malta on Monday that will be attended by French, German and Italian authorities. The officials will attempt to make a temporary deal to manage the standoffs that have in the past year kept migrants rescued by NGO ships stuck at sea for days and even weeks.

The Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking, a search-and-rescue vessel jointly operated by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders, picked up 217 people from four boats in the central Mediterranean from Sept. 17-19. The migrants had all departed from Libya.

Malta, a European Union member, on Friday allowed in 35 migrants, but rejected taking in the 182 remaining on the rescue ship. Italy had also referred the ship's request to other European nations before announcing Sunday evening that it could head to the port of Messina.

The ship should arrive in the Sicilian port on Tuesday morning to disembark those who were rescued. They are mostly sub-Saharan Africans and include a newborn baby and 13 other children under the age of 15.

According to the International Organization for Migration, 6,570 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea so far this year, and 2,260 in Malta. Both nations, typically the nearest arrival point for ships crossing the central Mediterranean, want other EU members to share the load.

The 28-nation bloc hasn't reached an agreement on an automatic system for determining where rescued migrants are allowed to land and potentially seek asylum.

Politicians in favor of blocking the ships accuse NGOs of colluding with smugglers. But data shows that most sea arrivals through the central Mediterranean do not happen through charity rescues.

The IOM, which collects data at landing points in Italy, estimates that so far this year, half of the people arriving in the country by sea had been rescued by Italian authorities. Another 38,5% were people arriving in overcrowded wooden boats, and only 11,3% were disembarked after being rescued by NGO ships, according to the IOM.

Italy allowed the Ocean Viking last week to disembark 82 rescued migrants at the tiny island of Lampedusa.

But in a scenario that has played out several times before, the Italian government gave the authorization only after Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg agreed to take some people in the group.

11403909,2019-09-20,"BRUSSELS (AP) -- The death of a Sudanese man from a gunshot wound after a group of migrants fled from guards taking them to a detention center in Libya is raising fresh, troubling questions about the plight of people caught in the conflict-torn country and the role of the European Union-trained Libyan coast guard.

The 28-year-old man was one of several migrants picked up by the Libyan coast guard in waters that are part of a vast search area the country registered last year under an EU-backed plan to hand off control of Mediterranean Sea rescues to Libya and to stop people setting out for Europe.

His death comes two months after 53 migrants were killed in an airstrike on the Tajoura detention center in Libya. The center is still operating despite deep concern about the arbitrary detention in appalling conditions of migrants trying to reach Europe to escape conflict, persecution and poverty.

Some 5,000 men, women and children are being detained in Libya, more than 3,000 in active conflict zones, according to the IOM.

The latest incident happened Thursday after the coast guard returned a group of migrants to shore at Tripoli's Abusitta disembarkation area. The man was shot in the stomach after armed men fired into the air when several of a group of 103 migrants under guard tried to escape, according to the International Organization for Migration. An IOM doctor treated the man at the scene but he died two hours later in a local clinic.

""This was a tragedy waiting to happen,"" IOM spokesman Leonard Doyle said of the latest death. ""The use of live bullets against unarmed vulnerable civilians, men, women and children alike, is unacceptable under any circumstances and raises alarms over the safety of migrants and humanitarian staff.""

The arrival in 2015 of well over 1 million people -- most of them Syrians and Iraqis fleeing war -- sparked a major crisis in Europe as countries bickered over how best to manage the migrants. While they worked with Turkey on a deal to stop people entering from the east, the Europeans, led by Italy, also began channeling millions of euros into Libya.

The effort was ramped up in 2017 even though the EU itself acknowledges that 4,000 to 7,000 people were detained in 24 centers run by Libya's Department for Combatting Illegal Migration and that even more were being kept off the grid.

""Armed groups hold migrants in an unknown number of unofficial detention centers across the country. Migrants and refugees do not undergo any kind of formal registration and don't have access to legal process before and while being in detention,"" notes an EU action plan drawn up to help manage migrant flows through Libya.

""Conditions in detention are generally inhumane: severely overcrowded, without adequate access to toilets or washing facilities, food, or clean water. In several detention centers, migrants are held in large numbers in a single room without sufficient space to lie down.""

At least 46 million euros ($51 million) were earmarked for the Libyan coast guard. Through its flagship anti-smuggling naval effort Operation Sophia -- currently more flag than ship, since Italy's anti-migrant government withdrew permission for naval vessels to take part -- the EU has trained coast guard personnel.

In a move not widely announced, in June last year Libya, with European encouragement, registered a massive search-and-rescue area in the Mediterranean with the International Maritime Organization. The zone reaches out around 160 kilometers (100 miles) -- deep into international waters and about halfway to the Italian island of Lampedusa, where many migrants head when they leave the Libyan coast for Europe.

Aid groups say almost all rescue emergencies happen in international waters about 50 kilometers (30 miles) off the Libyan coast. That means they are obliged to contact the coast guard there first.

""They simply unilaterally declared they would be coordinating activities,"" Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, humanitarian affairs adviser at Doctors Without Borders (MSF) told The Associated Press. ""Considering the capacity of the coastguard, it's a huge portion of the Mediterranean Sea that they're supposed to take responsibility for.

""We had experiences where, when we called the Libyan authorities they would not pick up the phone, they would not answer even if there is an obligation to be available 24 hours a day and in English,"" she said. ""We would call Italy and then the Libyans would pick up the phone.""

Another aid group told AP that they best way they found to reach the Libyan coast guard in an emergency was to send an email.

Hadj-Sahraoui said the Libyans tell them to take people to Tripoli, but bound by international law MSF cannot return migrants to strife-torn Libya. But Malta and Italy say the rescues are not their responsibility either, and Rome has warned that the crew of any rescue ship entering its waters could face fines and jail.

The Libyans have 29 ""naval assets,"" according to a classified Operation Sophia report obtained by AP. Six are operated by the navy. In the summer of 2018, they were at sea about 10 times per week.

The report says they ""need to be sustained not only with the presence of a maritime security provider in the area ... but also with training, equipment and maintenance."" It remains to be seen whether Italy's new government will allow warships to return to sea with the operation, even though European surveillance planes and drones continue to help the Libyan coast guard find migrants from the air.

Migration agency officials are concerned that the coast guard is no longer getting its orders from the weak, U.N.-backed government and that militias and rogue commanders are operating some ships, possibly even refitting them for battle. Meanwhile, the conflict involving militias around Tripoli in the west and the self-styled Libyan National Army led by Gen. Khalifa Hifter in the east drags on.

11403910,2019-08-13,"BRUSSELS (AP) -- The United Nations refugee agency urgently appealed to European governments Tuesday to let two migrant rescue ships disembark more than 500 passengers who remain stranded at sea as countries bicker over who should take responsibility for them.

The people rescued while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa are on ships chartered by humanitarian aid groups, which the Italian government has banned from its territory. The archipelago nation of Malta has refused to let the ships into the country's ports.

It's unclear where they might find safe harbor, even though the Italian island of Lampedusa appears closest. About 150 of the rescued passengers have been on the Spanish-flagged charity ship, the Open Arms, since they were plucked from the Mediterranean 13 days ago.

""This is a race against time,"" Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR special envoy for the Central Mediterranean, said in a statement. ""Storms are coming, and conditions are only going to get worse.""

While the number of migrants reaching Europe by sea has dropped substantially so far this year, UNHCR says nearly 600 people have died or gone missing in waters between Libya, Italy and Malta in 2019.

The agency said many of the people onboard the ships ""are reportedly survivors of appalling abuses in Libya."" Cochetel said the ships ""must be immediately allowed to dock"" and their passengers ""allowed to receive much-needed humanitarian aid.""

""To leave people who have fled war and violence in Libya on the high seas in this weather would be to inflict suffering upon suffering,"" the envoy said.

The captain of the Open Arms, Marc Reig, sent a letter Monday to the Spanish Embassy in Malta asking Madrid to grant asylum to 31 minors on his ship. A senior Spanish official said Tuesday that Reig's request carries no legal weight because the captain doesn't have authority to seek protection for the minors.

The limbo of the Open Arms and a Norwegian-flagged ship operated by Doctors Without Borders and sea rescue group SOS Mediterranee is the latest in a string of standoffs that kept Europe-bound migrants at sea in miserable conditions.

Southern nations that have been the main arrival points since 2015 - notably Italy, but also Malta and Greece - have complained of feeling abandoned by their European Union partners to cope with the influx.

Italy's hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, reiterated Tuesday his intent to ensure that the ships don't enter Italian ports.

Differences among EU member nations over how to manage mass migration have sparked a political crisis in Europe, while attempts to reform the bloc's asylum system have failed. The issue has been a vote-winner for far-right and populist parties.

The EU's executive commission said it has urged member countries to take action to resolve the status of the recently rescued passengers and stands ready to offer national governments support but cannot act alone.

""There's nothing more we can do,"" a European Commission spokeswoman said Tuesday.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said late Monday in a tweet that ""a critical rescue"" had brought 105 more people onto the Ocean Viking, raising the number of migrants aboard the vessel to 356.

Sea-Eye posted photos on Twitter showing the migrants being handed over to the Maltese military. An earlier video showed the migrants cheering at the news that they would be transferred first to Malta, then to other EU countries.

Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced Saturday on Twitter that the small EU nation would allow the 40 migrants aboard the Alan Kurdi to disembark after a request from Germany. He said the EU commission had organized their transfer to other EU nations.

11403916,2019-06-05,"In the Middle East, it has often begun the same way: a popular swell of street protests against long-entrenched autocrats and demonstrators inspired by burgeoning aspirations for democracy and freedom.

But then the military moves in. Its ruthless, harsh force helps prop up the leader and his family, or safeguard the military's own longevity after a leader falls. Death, detention and disappearances become commonplace and in some cases, ruinous civil war with external intervention breaks out.

Organizers of the pro-democracy protests in Sudan say the death toll across the country since the violent dispersal of their sit-in camp in Khartoum earlier this week has increased to 60. Sudan's deadly crackdown has evoked Arab Spring bloodshed from earlier this decade -- uprisings in Egypt, Syria and Libya. Tunisia was the one nation to escape mass carnage.

Here's a look at military crackdowns across the Arab world since 2011:

TUNISIA

The Arab Spring was born in Tunisia, where it was called the Jasmine Revolution. The country had long been wracked by widespread repression, high unemployment, rocketing inflation and endemic corruption under the rule of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.

The self-immolation by a beaten down and humiliated street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi led to nationwide protests fueled by social media that brought down the longtime authoritarian president in January 2011. He fled into exile to Saudi Arabia. That ushered in democracy for Tunisia and inspired similar movements around the Arab world. Though there were deaths in the struggle, it was nowhere near the bloody tolls of other Arab nations. The revolution transformed Tunisia into a fledgling democracy that became a catalyst for the Arab Spring, then miraculously transcended it as the only country to keep its transition peaceful.

There were heady days in Cairo's Tahrir Square when the January 25 Revolution took hold in 2011 and within weeks, toppled autocrat and key Western ally President Hosni Mubarak. There were striking scenes as Mubarak loyalists swept into crowds on camels, beating protesters. Calm was restored when the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took over, and the people cheered the troops. The military was to rule until elections were held in June 2012.

Then, the one-year reign of freely elected President Mohammed Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood subsequently engaged in concerted power-grabbing, was brought to a sudden end by the military's removal of Morsi, following mass protests against his divisive rule. Defense Minister Gen. Abdel el-Sissi took over and won subsequent elections deemed fraudulent by detractors and some analysts.

The worst bloodshed occurred in August 2013, when troops under el-Sissi's command descended upon protest camps filled with Morsi's supporters, killing hundreds in Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya Square and elsewhere in a single day. Morsi remains in prison facing a life sentence while a death penalty against him was overturned.

Voters in Egypt recently approved constitutional amendments allowing el-Sissi to remain in power until 2030, a move critics fear will cement his authoritarian rule. Opposition and freedom of speech has been largely crushed in Egypt while el-Sissi has been lauded by President Donald Trump for his crackdown on Islamic militants.

The Libyan chapter of the Arab uprisings took a violent turn immediately after demonstrations erupted in several cities over housing in January 2011. Protesters were fired upon and fought back in an armed revolt as the country -- held together for four decades by the mercurial cult of personality and wealth cultivated by Moammar Gadhafi -- began to unravel. Civil war raged and widespread abuses were committed by both Gadhafi's forces and the rebels.

Western forces intervened on the rebels' side with punishing airstrikes that helped lead to Gadhafi's ouster as he was caught in his native city of Sirte. His killing was captured on video and then seen online around the world in all its gruesome detail. For days, the rebels showed off Gadhafi's body so the nation would believe he was dead.

After Gadhafi's ouster and killing, Libya sank further into chaos and turmoil, with the country divided today between two governments and an array of militias fighting for power and territory.

The uprising in Syria began in March 2011. In the city of Daraa, youths scrawled graffiti against the rule of President Bashar Assad. Having witnessed cataclysmic events in Egypt and Tunisia, Assad's forces moved quickly to brutally crush the opposition.

But it wasn't to be a relatively swift and merciless crackdown as the 1982 Hama massacre by Assad's father, Hafez, which killed thousands. Instead the country lurched into a civil war, now in its ninth year and counting. Hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions more internally displaced or having fled to other countries. Atrocities committed by the government, including chemical attacks, as well as those by rebel groups and the Islamic State group, which at one time controlled a third of the country before it was vanquished, have been relentless.

The bloodiest chapter in the war may still loom, in rebel-held Idlib, with tens of thousands of civilians in the crossfire as Assad's government, backed by Russian airpower, has pledged to recover the province and every other inch of Syrian territory lost during the war.

Last December, as Sudan grappled with rising prices and shortages, the Sudanese Professionals Association planned a march to the capital, Khartoum, to demand wage increases. When separate demonstrations over rising bread prices erupted in Atbara, a railway hub north of Khartoum, the SPA broadened its demands to the overthrow of the government, invoking slogans from the Arab Spring uprisings.

The umbrella group of unions succeeded in April where war, sanctions and the International Criminal Court, which had indicted President Omar al-Bashir on genocide charges in Darfur, had failed -- ending his three-decade rule. But the military's crackdown this week as security forces overran the main protest sit-in site, followed by its call for snap elections in the coming months and dismissal of protesters demands, appears to show the army has no intention of ushering civilian rule and relinquishing its own power any time soon. The Sudanese generals now say they want to resume negotiations with protest leaders but the demonstrators dismiss such calls as long as troops are shooting and killing them.",AP,energy,,"['Tunisia', 'Egypt', 'Cairo', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Libya', 'Khartoum', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Sirte', 'Daraa', 'Idlib Governorate', 'Russia']",Sudan's deadly crackdown evokes Arab Spring bloodshed,https://apnews.com/f806fa1e18634848a277f3725f3d3bb9,None,
11403917,2019-04-30,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) -- Tunisia and Italy bolstered their ties with a visit Tuesday by the Italian prime minister, concluding commercial deals and pleading for dialogue, not fighting, to prevail in Libya.

Seven cooperation agreements on energy, education and decentralization were signed during the visit by Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte and an array of top ministers for the first inter-governmental summit between the two nations.

Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio and anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini were among those present. Italy's defense minister didn't t make the trip, as initially planned.

An important delegation of Italian business leaders took part in an economic forum.

After taking office last May, Conte made Tunisia his first stop south of the Mediterranean in November. Accords were reached then on help in controlling the more than 400-kilometer (250-mile) Libyan-Tunisian border and development of Tunisia's interior.

On Tuesday, Conte met with Tunisia's President Beji Caid Essebsi, notably discussing the worsening situation in Libya.

""Dialogue is the only means to avoid an escalation and guarantee the unity and stability of Libya,"" Conte was quoted in a statement by the president's office as saying.

He expressed firm support for Tunisia's efforts to fight illegal immigration and extremism, the statement said.

Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, speaking with Conte at a joint news conference, said that Italy and Tunisia are the nations ""most touched"" by the crisis in Libya.

He expressed fear that Tunisia could relive the experience of 2011 when more than 1 million refugees fled Libya for Tunisia in the fighting that ended the rule of Moammar Gadhafi, and said security forces at the Libyan border are in a state of maximum alert.

Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter's self-styled Libyan National Army launched an operation to retake the Libyan capital of Tripoli on April 4 and has been locked in heavy fighting in and around the city with militias loosely allied with a U.N.-supported government. The clashes have killed more than 270 people.

Conte said Italy talks with all sides and ""has good relations with Hifter."" But he rejected the fighting.

Libya slid into chaos after longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown and killed in 2011.

The 2011 Tunisian revolution triggered the Arab Spring that ricocheted to Libya. Now, Tunisia's budding democracy is plagued with economic and security problems, and youth seeking an exit.

Under Salvini, Italy has essentially closed its ports to migrants fleeing Libya aboard smugglers' boats. According to interior ministry data, 722 migrants arrived in Italy in 2019 as of Monday, compared with 9,419 during the same period last year and 37,034 in 2017.

Whereas Nigerian, Eritrean and other sub-Saharan Africans often made up the majority of migrants coming to Italy in previous years, Tunisians now take the top spot.

As of Monday, 226 of the migrants arriving this year were Tunisians, according to the interior ministry.

11403918,2019-03-23,"BEIRUT (AP) -- The announcement of victory over the Islamic State group in Syria marks the end of the extremists' self-styled caliphate, a proto-state in which they held millions hostage to their dark and brutal vision.

But IS, which traces its roots back to the bloody emergence of al-Qaida in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, has survived past defeats and is already waging a low-level insurgency in areas it was driven from months or even years ago.

The grueling 4 ½-year campaign to drive IS from the territories it once held has left entire towns and neighborhoods in ruins, in both war-torn Syria and Iraq. If the long-standing grievances of Sunni Muslims in both countries continue to fester, the extremists could rise again.

What is over is the Islamic State group's physical ""caliphate,"" after the Syrian Democratic forces, a Kurdish-led group supported by the United States, declared on Saturday the capture of the last tiny patch of territory controlled by the militants at the village of Baghouz, in eastern Syria.

That domain once stretched over large parts of Syria and Iraq, which the group conquered in a blitz in the summer of 2014, capturing towns and cities, including Mosul, Iraq's second-largest. The fighters bulldozed berms along the border and proclaimed a contiguous caliphate stretching across a third of both countries. At its height, the territory was the size of Britain, stretching nearly to the northern Syrian town of Aleppo to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, and home to 8 million people.

The extremists governed under a harsh and violent interpretation of Islam. They massacred those who resisted their rule and beheaded hostages including western journalists and foreign aid workers in gruesome videos circulated online. Alleged adulterers were stoned to death, those believed to be gay were thrown from the tops of buildings, and children were made to watch the atrocities as part of their brainwashing. The group captured thousands of women from Iraq's Yazidi minority, forcing them into sexual slavery.

IS also carried out the more mundane actions of a state -- collecting taxes, printing school textbooks, minting its own currency and restoring public infrastructure. It was an experiment in statehood that not even al-Qaida ever tried on a significant scale.

From its de facto capital of Raqqa, in northern Syria, its leaders plotted spectacular attacks abroad, including the 2015 Paris attacks that killed 130 people. As IS began to hemorrhage territory, it began opportunistically claiming attacks without any evidence of its involvement.

The self-proclaimed caliphate attracted tens of thousands of people from around the world, lured by the group's online activism and slickly produced propaganda videos. Young, troubled men were eager to wage war against those branded enemies of Islam, while others were drawn to the promise of life in an Islamic state governed by God's law.

That physical ""caliphate"" was declared dead, for now.

The grueling four-year air and ground campaign against IS has killed or wounded tens of thousands of people, drove hundreds of thousands from their homes and left a swath of destruction stretching from the suburbs of Damascus to central Iraq.

The major cities IS once held -- Mosul, Raqqa, Fallujah and Ramadi -- have all seen major devastation.

The group put up fierce resistance nearly everywhere, using civilians as human shields and launching waves of car bomb and suicide attacks. As it slowly retreated, it left behind booby-traps and explosives that in many areas have yet to be cleared.

The U.S.-led coalition dropped tens of thousands of bombs over Syria and Iraq to help its allies on the ground advance, sometimes pulverizing entire city blocks. Syrian government forces backed by Russian air power battled IS in some areas, as did Iraq's state-sanctioned militias, with help from Iran.

The death toll from the campaign remains uncounted. In a report released last year, the coalition confirmed the deaths of 1,139 civilians in airstrikes conducted between August 2014 and November 2018. Rights groups say the number is much higher.

An Associated Press investigation found at least 9,000 civilians died in the assault to retake Mosul alone. In Raqqa, the U.S.-backed campaign killed hundreds of civilians and caused destruction on a massive scale.

Syria is still mired in civil war, and Iraq estimates it will need $100 billion to rebuild. Local leaders in Mosul say they need that much for their city alone. No one has offered to foot the bill, and hard-hit areas remain empty, even years later.

The official declaration of victory is of mostly symbolic value. Thousands of IS militants have dispersed and gone to ground, and U.S. defense officials have warned that IS could stage a comeback in Syria within a year if military and counterterrorism pressure is eased.

""They've cut the trunk of this malignant tree, but they haven't pulled up its roots, which are still capable of growing and spreading,"" Hisham al-Hashemi, a researcher in extremism and expert on IS, wrote in a Twitter post.

Activists who closely follow the conflict in Syria already point to signs of a growing insurgency and sleeper cells carrying out assassinations, setting up flying checkpoints and claiming roadside bombs in liberated areas across Syria and Iraq.

That insurgency could gain strength as President Donald Trump presses ahead with his planned U.S. withdrawal from Syria. The American commander overseeing the fight against IS, Gen. Joseph Votel, has warned that the group is far from being defeated, saying its leaders have dispersed and gone underground.

""What we are seeing now is not the surrender of ISIS as an organization but a calculated decision to preserve the safety of their families and preservation of their capabilities,"" he said earlier this month, adding that the insurgents are ""waiting for the right time to resurge.""

The withdrawal of American forces from eastern Syria would open the door for major turmoil as various actors -- including the Syrian government, allied with Russia and Iran -- race to fill the vacuum.

IS was all but defeated once before, when U.S. forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011; experts warn it could stage another devastating comeback.

And IS has established affiliates across Asia and Africa, and continues to be active in places like Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, Yemen and the Philippines.

WHAT ABOUT DETAINED FIGHTERS AND THEIR FAMILIES?

Another major concern is jihadis finding their way back to Europe.

Around 1,000 foreign fighters are currently being held in Kurdish-run prisons in northern Syria. Their wives -- many of them from Western countries -- and their children are in camps in northern Syria.

Syrian Kurdish authorities are calling on countries to take back their nationals, saying they cannot afford to keep shouldering the burden. Trump has weighed in, calling on Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to repatriate their nationals and put them on trial.

""The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go,"" he tweeted in February.

But few countries are willing to bring back people they view as a security threat, posing a dilemma for the Kurdish-led forces as the U.S. prepares to withdraw.",AP,energy,,"['Mosul', 'United States', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Beirut', 'Raqqa', 'Damascus', 'Aleppo', 'Baghdad', 'United Kingdom', 'Fallujah', 'Ramadi', 'Russia', 'Iran']","Q&A: The end of the Islamic State group's ""caliphate""",https://apnews.com/7d6592a11d7f4f9596e48c6fd01166e7,None,
11403919,2019-03-20,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- In March 2016, European governments breathed a sigh of relief as the European Union reached a deal with Turkey designed to stop hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants heading into the heart of Europe. For many of those who had fled war, hunger and poverty hoping for a bright future on the continent, the deal shattered their dreams.

Three years on, here is a look back at the agreement and the effect it's had on migration.

WHAT DID THE EU-TURKEY DEAL SAY?

One of the main provisions of the deal, which came into effect on March 20, 2016, was that all those arriving on Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast -- the preferred route at the time -- would be detained and returned to Turkey unless they successfully applied for asylum in Greece. They wouldn't be able to move on to the Greek mainland, from where hundreds of thousands before them had made their way through the Balkans and on to central and northern Europe.

However, the deportations didn't go as planned. Instead of waiting to apply for asylum in their preferred European country, new arrivals applied as soon as they arrived on the islands, which delayed deportations and created a massive backlog in Greece's asylum system. In practice, actual deportations have been very few and far between.

DID THE AGREEMENT WORK?

On a very basic level of reducing the number of asylum-seekers heading to other European countries, the deal was very effective.

More than 1.2 million people registered for asylum in EU member states in 2015 and again in 2016, at the height of the crisis. That number fell by half the following year, with just over 654,000 new asylum applications in 2017 and even fewer -- just over 580,000 -- in 2018, according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat. Germany continues to be the most popular country for those seeking refugee status, followed by France and Greece. The main countries of origin of the applicants are Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

But the reduction in numbers has come at a cost.

Aid groups have repeatedly slammed the deal as inhumane, noting it has left thousands stranded in miserable conditions. On the eve of its third anniversary, 25 human rights, medical aid and volunteer groups signed an open letter calling on European leaders ""to take immediate and sustained action to end the unfair and unnecessary containment policy.""

It has also not completely stopped arrivals on Greek islands, although the numbers are far lower than the thousands per day in 2015 and early 2016.

WHAT IS THE SITUATION ON THE ISLANDS?

The stipulation of new arrivals being held on the islands has left thousands languishing in crammed camps. Samos island has seen the worst overcrowding, with around 4,000 people vying for space in a camp with a capacity of 648. The largest camp in the eastern Aegean, Moria on the island of Lesbos which holds more than 4,800 people in facilities designed for 3,100, has come under the severest criticism from rights groups and even local officials over poor living and security conditions.

Greek authorities note that the terms of the EU-Turkey agreement prevent them from moving people off the islands en masse. Instead, they have tried to ease overcrowding by sending to the mainland those designated as vulnerable -- such as the sick or very elderly, families with young children or single parent families.

But with dozens, sometimes hundreds, arriving each week, that hasn't been enough to definitively deal with the problem. As of Monday night, a total of 14,742 people were being held on the islands, most of them on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos.

""Greece has become a dumping ground for the men, women and children that the European Union has failed to protect,"" Emmanuel Goue of the Doctors Without Borders medical aid group said in a statement on the third anniversary of the EU-Turkey deal.

""What was once touted as a 'refugee emergency' has given way to inexcusable levels of human suffering across the Greek islands and on mainland Greece,"" Goue said. ""The EU and Greek authorities continue to rob vulnerable people of their dignity and health, seemingly in an effort to deter others from coming. This policy is cruel, inhumane and cynical, and it needs to end.""

WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF EUROPE?

The increased difficulty heading into Europe from the Greek islands meant migrants and refugees soon sought out alternative routes to get into the EU. With more than 57,000 unauthorized arrivals by sea in 2018, Spain became the No. 1 route to the EU by sea. The figure was more than double the number of arrivals in 2017 at 21,000. NGOs and the Spanish government itself blamed the increase on the EU-Turkey deal and on later agreements with Libya which essentially shut down the central Mediterranean route which had seen boats head from Libya to Italy.

There has, however, been a sharp decrease in the number of arrivals by sea in Spain in late 2018 and the first three months of this year.

More people are also dying. According to the International Organization for Migration, around 2,300 people died crossing the Mediterranean Sea last year, almost double the year before. Nearly one third of them perished in the so-called Western Mediterranean, which links the northwestern African coast with European coasts in Spain.

A Nigerian-born Canadian college professor, author and satirist. They were all among the 157 people from 35 countries who died Sunday morning when an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 jetliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa en route to Nairobi, Kenya. Here are some of their stories.

-- Hussein Swaleh, the former secretary general of the Football Kenya Federation, was named as being among the dead by Sofapaka Football Club.

He was due to return home on the flight after working as the match commissioner in an African Champions League game in Egypt on Friday.

-- Cedric Asiavugwa, a law student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., was on his way to Nairobi after the death of his fiancee's mother, the university said in a statement.

Asiavugwa, who was in his third year at the law school, was born and raised in Mombasa, Kenya. Before he came to Georgetown, he worked with groups helping refugees in Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, the university said.

At Georgetown, Asiavugwa studied international business and economic law.

The university said Asiavugwa's family and friends ""remembered him as a kind, compassionate and gentle soul, known for his beautifully warm and infectious smile.""

-- Pius Adesanmi, a Nigerian professor with Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, was on his way to a meeting of the African Union's Economic, Social and Cultural Council in Nairobi, John O. Oba, Nigeria's representative to the panel, told The Associated Press.

The author of ""Naija No Dey Carry Last,"" a collection of satirical essays, Adesanmi had degrees from Ilorin and Ibadan universities in Nigeria, and the University of British Columbia. He was director of Carleton's Institute of African Studies, according to the university's website. He was also a former assistant professor of comparative literature at Pennsylvania State University.

The Mediterranea Saving Humans group, which monitors migrant rescues, said Monday on Twitter that it heard about a distress call from a boat near Al Khoms, Libya. It appealed for Italian or Maltese coast guard ships to go to the area so the migrants aren't returned to Libya.
