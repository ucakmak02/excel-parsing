The event, held from January 15 - 17, 2016 in Hammamet, Tunisia, was organized by UNFPA Libya in coordination and with assistance from UNFPA Tunis and UNESCO Libya/EU-funded Project (NET-MED Youth).

It brought together 45 Libyan and Tunisian youth active in civil society to formulate a 2-year national action plans for youth in each of their respective countries. These action plans will serve as starting points to develop a multidisciplinary, multi-dimensional national youth strategy for Libya, and to review with government authorities and elaborate upon the existing national youth strategy in Tunis.

Noting the importance of listening to youth voices and ideas in national policies, Dr. Georges Makram Georgi, country Director for UNFPA Libya, emphasized in his opening remarks ""We need to take concrete steps, in the form of realistic recommendations, to make youth a central focus in national policies"".

Participants represented a broad range of local civil society organizations from both Libya and Tunisia. In a series of intensive workshops, the participants identified the most relevant obstacles youth face in education, health, the job market, and challenges related to civic engagement, gender equality, peace-building and social cohesion.

""We recognize the role that young people play in promoting a culture of peace"", noted Mr. Chokri Benyahia from UNFPA Tunisia.

11400442,2016-10-14,"Verdict ends case filled with claims of threats, toxic trades

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. didn't dupe Libyan officials into investments that lost $1.2 billion, a London court ruled, putting to rest claims the bank leveraged its reputation as well as lavish meals and prostitutes to win the sovereign wealth fund's trust.

The investment bank did not have ""undue influence"" over the Libyan Investment Authority when it pushed for what were ultimately money-losing derivative trades, and there is no evidence Goldman Sachs reaped excessive profits, Judge Vivien Rose said Friday.

The Libyan Investment Authority, a $60 billion oil wealth fund set up under former dictator Moammar Qaddafi, sued Goldman Sachs saying it was misled into signing derivative deals it never properly understood. The trades ended up being virtually worthless after the company shares they were linked to fell in the 2008 crisis.

""Their relationship did not go beyond the normal cordial and mutually beneficial relationship that grows up between a bank and client,"" Rose said in a written decision.

Gifts, Internship

The LIA alleged that the New York bank bought gifts, paid for extravagant entertainment and offered an internship to a Libyan official's brother in an effort to secure the deals. One former Goldman Sachs salesman, Youssef Kabbaj, was accused by the LIA of hiring call girls while at a conference with a Libyan contact. During an argument in July 2008, the court heard how an LIA executive threatened to make Kabbaj disappear and told him to get out of the country.

Judge Rose said the internship, awarded to former LIA executive Mustafa Zarti's brother, ""did not have a material influence on the decision"" to enter a series of derivatives trades linked to companies including Citigroup Inc. LIA officials ""understood at all times that Mr. Kabbaj was a salesman"" and that Goldman would make money from the investments, she said.

The LIA said following the ruling that it was disappointed with the decision, but it was too soon to consider its next steps.

""Time will be needed fully to digest the judgment and all options are being considered,"" the LIA said in a statement.

Goldman Sachs shares climbed 2.5 percent to $171.65 at 10:00 a.m. in New York, as U.S. investment banks broadly climbed after JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported better-than-expected trading revenue in the third quarter.

""We are pleased to win this case, with a comprehensive judgment in our favor,"" said Sebastian Howell, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in London.

The Libya government under Colonel Qaddafi had a long history of using the financial system to evade economic sanctions imposed because of links to terror attacks, said Jason Pack, president of Libya-Analysis, a consultancy focused on the country. ""The idea they were complete babes in the woods wasn't really credible,"" he said.

During the trial, an LIA employee testified he had never heard of Goldman Sachs, or the word derivative, before joining the fund.

11400443,2016-09-14,"Civilian threat overstated and Islamist danger not identified

U.K. intervention in Libya that led to the 2011 overthrow of Moammar Al Qaddafi was based on bad intelligence and inaccurate assumptions about the rebellion in the north African country, according to a panel of lawmakers.

David Cameron, the prime minister at the time, was decisive in pushing the move to carry out airstrikes in support of Libyan rebels through the National Security Council without properly assessing the threat to civilians and the role of Islamist extremists in the uprising, the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said in a report Wednesday.

""U.K. policy in Libya before and since the intervention of March 2011 was founded on erroneous assumptions and an incomplete understanding of the country and the situation,"" the committee chairman, Crispin Blunt, a member of Cameron's Conservative Party, said in a statement. ""Political engagement might have delivered civilian protection, regime change and reform at a lesser cost to the U.K. and Libya. The U.K. would have lost nothing by trying these instead of focusing exclusively on regime change by military means.""

Britain and France led intervention in Libya to protect civilians after Qaddafi threatened to crush a rebellion against his 42-year rule. Only 15 House of Commons lawmakers voted against the attacks after Cameron promised the intervention would be limited to airstrikes.

Repeated Mistakes

Britain ""drifted into a policy of regime change"" and repeated its mistakes in Iraq by failing to plan properly for Libya's government after Qaddafi was overthrown, the committee said. Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy traveled to Tripoli and Benghazi in September 2011 to celebrate the rebel victory and promised to help rebuild the country.

""Having led the intervention with France, we had a responsibility to support Libyan economic and political reconstruction,"" Blunt said. ""But our lack of understanding of the institutional capacity of the country stymied Libya's progress in establishing security on the ground and absorbing financial and other resources from the international community.""

Britain's intelligence about the uprising was flawed and failed to take into account the opportunities that would be created for extremists, the panel found after interviewing key players in the decision to go to war, including the then defence secretary, Liam Fox, and the foreign secretary, William Hague.

Islamist Threat

""It may be that the U.K. government was unable to analyze the nature of the rebellion in Libya due to incomplete intelligence and insufficient institutional insight and that it was caught up in events as they developed,"" the panel said. ""It could not verify the actual threat to civilians posed by the Qaddafi regime; it selectively took elements of Moammar Qaddafi's rhetoric at face value; and it failed to identify the militant Islamist extremist element in the rebellion.""

The U.K. should have used former Prime Minister Tony Blair's contacts with the Qaddafi regime and paused military action once Benghazi was secured to try to broker a deal, the committee said.

The National Security Council, which was set up by Cameron to prevent a repeat of Blair's decision-making errors during the Iraq War, should be reviewed to ensure it is not making the same mistakes, the panel said.

11400444,2016-07-13,"No timing for lifting of force majeure on ports yet: NOC Four of biggest oil ports shut due to politics, fighting

Libya's government of national unity is working to reopen four of the OPEC country's biggest oil ports after securing a deal to unify the fractured nation's state energy company.

Four ports accounting for about 860,000 barrels a day in crude-exporting capacity have been shut due to political turmoil and fighting. A July 2 deal to unify rival administrations of the National Oil Corp. was meant to end the conflict over who can control oil sales in Libya, where factions are working to set up a Government of National Accord to help rebuild the country after five years of strife.

""The unity government is currently working on solving issues to reopen the strategic oil ports,"" Mohamed Elharari, an NOC spokesman, said in a telephone interview from Tripoli. ""There's no timeline yet for lifting force majeure for oil ports. It's not known to us yet, but we hope this happens soon.""

Libya, with Africa's largest proven crude reserves, split into separately governed regions in 2014, leading to the establishment of competing NOC administrations. The Government of National Accord, based in Tripoli, is trying to extend its authority over the rest of the country. Since the ouster five years ago of long-time ruler Moammar Al Qaddafi, Libya's oil facilities and ports have been attacked and its crude output has slumped.

Ports Reopening

The country currently pumps about 350,000 barrels a day of crude and exports 220,000 to 250,000 barrels a day, Elharari said. Libya was producing 1.6 million barrels a day before Qaddafi was toppled in a 2011 revolt and is now the second-smallest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, ahead of Gabon.

The closed ports of Es Sider, Zawiya, Ras Lanuf and Zueitina have a combined export capacity greater than the output of either Indonesia, Qatar or Ecuador -- fellow OPEC members. Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and Zueitina are shut under force majeure, a legal status protecting a party from liability if it can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control.

After the reopening of Es Sider, the country's biggest oil port, and Ras Lanuf, the third-largest, terminal operators will assess how much time they need to resume exporting, Elharari said. Both ports have come under attack, and most of Es Sider's storage tanks are damaged, he said. Zueitina is ""completely functional"" and ready to operate once force majeure is lifted, he said.

Crude exports from Es Sider and Ras Lanuf are to resume within a week, Ibrahim al-Jedran, a regional commander of Libya's Petroleum Facilities Guard, said on July 7 in a phone interview. The shipments will be made under the authority of the unity government, he said.

11400445,2016-06-06,"Advances in Iraq, Syria and Libya pile pressure on extremists

Islamic State militants are under attack on all fronts.

Soldiers and militias are pushing an offensive to dislodge the militants from Fallujah, the first major Iraqi city to fall to the group. Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting to capture the remaining stretch of Syrian territory along the Turkish border controlled by the jihadists. And in Libya, Islamic State's stronghold in Sirte is under pressure as militias advance from several directions.

The extremists are facing increased attacks often backed by airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition. But a well-resourced militant movement and the conflicting agendas of outside powers mean the group remains a powerful force. Here's what you need to know.

Blocking the border in Syria

Losing control of the 70 km (43 miles) of Syrian territory it holds along the border with Turkey would deny Islamic State access to a frontier it uses for smuggling weapons and fighters. The town of Manbij, northeast of strategically important Aleppo province, is at the heart of the battle, Faysal Itani, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said by e-mail.

To Islamic State, Manbij represents a possible ""entry point for enemies targeting the northern Aleppo countryside, and a potential staging point for a flanking operation against forces advancing on Raqqa city,"" the capital of the self-declared caliphate, Itani said. Losing the town would be a significant blow.

Syrian government forces are also pushing toward Raqqa, backed by Russian airstrikes, and are 30 km from the Al-Tabqa military base to the city's west, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Losing ground in Iraq and Libya

In Iraq, Fallujah lies just 50 km west of Baghdad and its fall to Islamic State in early 2014 was a major humiliation for the Iraqi government, one compounded by the loss of Mosul a few months later. Fallujah and nearby Ramadi, which was seized from militant control in December, are the main cities in Anbar province, home to leading Sunni tribes the Shiite-dominated government needs to rally to its side. Taking Fallujah may hasten an assault on Mosul.

European countries have been watching Islamic State's growth in Libya with alarm, given its proximity to Europe's southern shores and more stable North African nations such as Tunisia. Expelling the group from its foothold in Sirte would be a major relief for European leaders hit by Islamic State-inspired terrorism.

Are powers cooperating effectively against Islamic State?

Not always. American and allied planes are providing air support around Fallujah for the Iraqi military, which also benefits from the in-country help of U.S. special forces. Iraq's powerful Shiite militias, meanwhile, are backed by Iran. The Iraqi army and the militias cooperate, but the U.S. and Iran have publicly ruled out working together.

Turkish soldiers frequently fire artillery at Islamic State forces across the border in Syria in response to rocket attacks. But Turkey is hostile to Syrian Kurdish forces, one of the most successful groups in the battlefield against Islamic State. Turkish officials fear that the establishment of a de facto Kurdish state on their frontier in northern Syria would embolden Turkey's own Kurdish autonomy-seeking groups, led by the PKK.

Turkey protested to the U.S. after American special forces were photographed in action wearing insignia of the PYD Syrian Kurdish forces.

The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad is supported by Russia and Iran as it battles both Islamic State and rebel groups. The U.S., European powers and Sunni Gulf monarchies demand Assad's removal in an effort to end the country's five-year war.

Putting Libya back together

In Libya, Islamic State's stronghold in Sirte is under pressure from Petroleum Facilities Guards from the east and militias from Misrata to the west. The new United Nations-backed unity government of Prime Minister Fayez Serraj is in the process of creating a joint command to merge the various militias that support his administration.

But the fight against Islamic State will continue to include armed forces that don't support Serraj, such as those controlled by eastern commander General Khalifa Haftar who is perhaps the single biggest hurdle to reunifying fractured Libya.

Haftar has won support from neighboring Egypt. Other countries support Serraj, but have also helped Haftar because he's got Libya's most capable armed forces. French President Francois Hollande officially backs the unity government, but has signed major weapon deals with Egypt. Some of those ""may end up in Haftar's hands,"" Arturo Varvelli, a research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, wrote May 30.

So, is Islamic State on the back-foot?

They are weaker than at the start of the year. Colonel Steve Warren, until recently a top U.S. military spokesman, said last month Islamic State has lost 45 percent of territory it once held in Iraq and 20 percent of that it controlled in Syria. Targeting oil infrastructure has cut the militants' production by at least 30 percent and oil revenues by as much as 50 percent, he said.

In Libya, Islamic State suffered defeats in Benghazi and was pushed from Derna by a local Islamist group.

Resistance will continue, and Islamic State has scored victories amid its defeats. A week into the campaign to retake Fallujah, Iraqi forces haven't penetrated the city center. Talk about a Mosul offensive remains just that.

The European Union said it was considering sending a fleet closer to Libya's coast amid concern that human traffickers will switch to the central Mediterranean Sea to haul refugees toward Europe.

QuickTake Europe's Refugee Crisis

As migration slows in the eastern Mediterranean, EU foreign ministers may give greater powers to a five-warship fleet now patrolling international waters roughly 22 kilometers (14 miles) from Libya's shore.

""We'll talk about the mission we already have, to what extent we can expand that to also reduce illegal migration into Europe,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders told reporters Monday at an EU meeting in Luxembourg.

Libya's government-in-the-making would have to approve the wider EU operation, part of efforts to dam up migration routes from the Middle East and northern Africa after more than 1 million people made it to Europe last year.

The debate came amid initial reports of a new migrant shipwreck off the coast of Egypt, far from the European patrol zone. Many were feared drowned Sunday after a boat carrying as many as 400 mainly Somali migrants sank en route to Italy, a Somali diplomat told the BBC.

8,000 Saved

Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni spoke of ""a tragedy in the Mediterranean,"" but didn't have details.

Border closures across southeastern Europe and an EU-Turkey deal to send back illegal migrants cut the flow of people across the Aegean Sea to Greece to 2,016 so far in April, according to United Nations data.

During the same period, traffic picked up across the central Mediterranean, with 5,666 crossing to Italy. EU President Donald Tusk last week warned of ""alarming"" numbers poised in Libya to head for Europe.

Foreign ministers hold a teleconference with Libya's prime minister tonight. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he expects EU military planners to be given the go-ahead to map out the expanded mission.

The current mission has bottled up smugglers inside Libyan waters and saved more than 8,000 people since it debuted last June, the EU says. The bloc will now ""look for ways in which that can be made even more effective,"" David Lidington, British European affairs minister, said.

""This is obviously an occasion in which we are deeply concerned about nuclear security,"" Obama said after the meeting.

He said that Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the bombings in Brussels on March 22 that killed 31 people, must be put ""back on their heels"" as it loses territory in Iraq and Syria.

Hollande, whose country is battling a growing terrorist threat, is one of a handful of world leaders granted a meeting with Obama during the Nuclear Security Summit, a gathering of more than 50 nations in Washington on Thursday and Friday.

""We note Daesh is losing ground thanks to the strikes we have taken with the coalition,"" Hollande said, using an acronym for the militant group. Islamic State's capital of Raqqa, Syria, may soon be a target for coalition forces, he said.

Refugees from Syria's civil war and from Libya are putting ""enormous strain on European unity,"" Obama said. The two leaders said they discussed strengthening Libya's government to stem migration from the country.

Intelligence Sharing

Investigators have discovered links between the terrorist attacks that killed at least 130 people in Paris last year and the Brussels bombings, and the White House has proposed better collaboration and intelligence sharing among European counter-terrorism officials.

Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for both attacks, and Belgian police believe one of the suicide bombers in the Brussels attack was also involved in the Paris killings.

""Our European allies could more effectively share intelligence with one another and with the United States in a way that would enhance the security of all our citizens,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday. ""And we continue to make that case.""

Obama said after the meeting with Hollande that the French president has been a leader in efforts to improve intelligence sharing. During the summit, Obama is convening a meeting on combating Islamic State militants, who have threatened further attacks in Europe.

Obama and Hollande have some differences. Hollande has described Europe as being ""at war"" with Muslim extremists, while Obama has refrained from using the term ""radical Islam"" to describe the antagonists in the U.S. war on terrorism, for fear of alienating Muslims.

Hollande said Wednesday that he would drop planned constitutional changes that would have allowed the French government to strip convicted terrorists of citizenship. The plan faced backlash from members of Hollande's own party.

11400564,2016-12-20,"A growing geopolitical role comes at a price in blood, as Russia was forcefully reminded on Monday when its ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was shot in an Ankara art gallery. Russia might not be paying that price had it kept out of the Syrian conflict but, paradoxically, it has now joined the West in footing this bill.

In 2012, when Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, was killed by a mob in Benghazi, Russian propaganda outlets lectured the U.S. for meddling in the Middle East. ""It was on Washington's urging that NATO intervened in the conflict in Libya,"" Russian state television editorialized. ""But warnings that sooner or later this would produce a boomerang effect were drowned out by sloganeering about a victory for democracy in totalitarian countries.""

After Karlov's murder, Russia got a taste of the same medicine from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, who tweeted:

He then added in a follow-up that this was ""no excuse"" for killing the ambassador.

Callous as such statements are, there is some truth to them. Ambassadors are assassinated because they represent their countries, and they don't do it in the same abstract way as innocent victims of attacks like the one in Berlin on Monday night. Diplomats are conduits for their nations' policies. That sets them up as targets for those who want to make a statement against those policies.

Between 1968 and 1979, five U.S. ambassadors were killed in the line of duty, three of them in the Middle East, one in Cyprus and one in Guatemala -- both countries where the U.S. was accused of meddling. Turkey has a long list of diplomats, including four ambassadors, assassinated between 1973 and 1994 by Armenian militant organizations as revenge for the genocide of Armenians 100 years ago, which Turkey won't recognize to this day. In 1981, France lost its ambassador in Beirut as revenge for France's role in the Lebanese civil war. The list goes on, and it includes dozens of lower-ranking diplomats.

Russia has been extraordinarily lucky in this respect. In 1829, its ambassador in Tehran, one of Russia's most revered authors, Alexander Griboedov was killed in a riot against Russia's outsized influence and perceived arrogance after it won a war against Persia; to atone, the Shah sent the Rusian czar an enormous diamond. After that, Russian ambassadors were only killed by White Russian officers as revenge for the Bolshevik takeover of power. Waclaw Worowski was shot in Switzerland in 1923 and Pyotr Voikov in Poland in 1927. For the rest of the 20th century and beyond, top-ranking Russian diplomats were spared despite the Soviet Union's major geopolitical ambitions. One explanation could be that the Soviets took the security of their diplomats extra seriously, turning embassies into fortresses and closely guarding the ambassadors. Another reason is that the Soviet Union often sided with the same violent parties that killed Western diplomats.

Now, however, Russia finds itself in a new, unaccustomed position. It is still not part of the West as far as the West is concerned, but it is Western enough, godless enough to hundreds of Islamist terror groups. Some of them hate Russia and the U.S. equally, others have more hatred for one than for the other. The Turkish policeman who shot Karlov was apparently a strong backer of the rebels whom the Syrian Army, with Russian support, has just defeated in Aleppo. But one could easily imagine a U.S. ambassador being targeted for his country's failure to intervene, seen by some radicals as betrayal, or for the U.S. bombing raids on the Islamic State.

Even though nations that broadly represent the Western secular civilization have been unable to take a common stand in Syria, they are all targets to terrorists -- as indistinguishable as the various groups of fighters in Syria are to a casual Western observer. Russians may think their country intervened in Syria to counterbalance a hostile U.S. influence, but to Islamists, it is merely another crusader nation.

One can blame Karlov's murder on Russian President Vladimir Putin's swaggering assertiveness, on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's encouragement of Islamist values, or on wily Erdogan opponents trying to damage Turkey's budding partnership with Russia on Syria. One can examine the motivations of the specific assassin and decry the specific ambassador's lack of security consciousness. None of this matters much in the final analysis, though.

Broadly, ""Western"" powers meddling in the Middle East today face the same dangers as they did in the 1970s and early 1980s, when the majority of ambassadors were assassinated. The region is once again a powder keg, only this time the wars have displaced tens of millions of people. Many of them have a grievance against the interfering powers or can develop a grudge when recruiters for terrorist groups whisper poison in their ears. It's a war in which every representative of the secular world is a target for someone.

That, perhaps, is why there is no visible rift between Russia and Turkey. On Tuesday, the two countries' foreign ministers laid flowers together in Moscow in memory of the murdered ambassador. If the assassination is a casus belli at all, it should be one against Islamist radicals on all sides of the Syrian bloodbath.

When Donald Trump becomes president next month, he will inherit a long war that risks becoming a permanent one.

George W. Bush began it after 9/11, when he called it the ""war on terror."" Barack Obama has tried and failed to end it. ""Democracies should not operate in a state of permanently authorized war,"" he warned in his last major national security speech Monday. In this spirit, he laid out a series of principles he believed should guide America's counterterrorism efforts.

For the most part they make good sense. Keep the war lawful. Keep the threat in perspective. Drone strikes are the least worst option for taking terrorists off the battlefield. That kind of thing.

But when it comes to understanding the aims of the enemy, Obama makes the same mistake as his predecessor. ""The whole objective of these terrorists is to scare us into changing the nature of who we are and our democracy,"" he said this week. This is the president's version of George W. Bush's ""they hate us for our freedoms.""

On this point, Trump has an opening. The truth is that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other jihadists do not hate us just because of our freedom. Their objective is not to provoke an over-reaction where America ceases to be a democracy. It's much more straightforward. These groups want to force the non-Muslim world -- what they call the Dar al-Harb, or the house of war -- to submit to Islamic rule. Jihadists seek conquest.

Trump doesn't know a lot about foreign policy. But he does understand this. Obama and Bush do as well. But they also deliberately tried to define the enemy in the long war as un-Islamic, as murderous charlatans who defame a great religion.

This was a smart strategy. Many Muslims who believe the state should penalize adultery and blasphemy oppose terrorism. Also, states like Saudi Arabia have been important tactical allies against terrorists, particularly in recent years. Yet, ideologically, the Saudis and other Gulf states are still committed to a vision of political Islam for their own societies. An ideological war waged recklessly would alienate them.

At the same time, the impulse to narrow the definition of the enemy has ironically exacerbated the risks of permanent war. Obama should know. He authorized the raid that killed the head of al-Qaeda's snake, Osama bin Laden. After this, he tried to unwind the long war, arguing the threat had receded. And yet he leaves office with U.S. forces fighting al-Qaeda's affiliates, spinoffs and fellow travelers all over the Muslim world.

For a period, Obama's narrow war led to a bizarre phenomenon. When new outfits sprung up in Libya after the fall of its dictator, waving the black flags of jihad and promising to impose strict Islamic law in their areas of control, Obama's White House did nothing. When the Muslim Brotherhood and more radical parties took control of Egypt's government after the country's first real elections, the Obama White House saw an opportunity to advance U.S. interests by working with them.

This miscalculation was an example of what Andrew McCarthy, the former U.S. attorney who prosecuted the first case against the World Trade Center bombers, calls ""willful blindness."" By defining the enemy in un-ideological terms, Obama was unprepared to take on groups like Libya's Ansar al-Sharia or the Islamic State before they became powerful enough to seize territory. By trying to end the long war, Obama let threats gather and prolonged it.

There is of course a risk in taking the ideological approach too far. If, say, Trump begins purges of suspected Muslim Brotherhood operatives inside the U.S., he will be trampling on constitutional protections for American citizens. He will also be sowing the seeds of his own political ruin, because this is the kind of thing that will provoke fierce opposition from the courts, press and many in his own party.

If Trump is not careful in how he defines the threat, he risks alienating allies he will need in the fight against the terrorists. Finally, Trump would be making a mistake if he gave leaders like Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a blank check. It's true that Sisi has called for a reformation within Islam, which is much needed. But he has also failed to distinguish between his legitimate political opposition and the radicals that briefly thrived in his country after the revolution. This will not end well for Sisi. As Egypt's history proves, the Muslim Brotherhood thrives as a secret society. Its more radical adherents murdered Anwar Sadat when the group was largely underground.

But Trump nonetheless has an opportunity. He can, for example, make it clear that America will be a safe haven for anyone in the Muslim world facing persecution from radicals, whether they are marked as blasphemers or from minority faiths such as Coptic Christians. Trump can also align more closely with leaders like Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan to build a quiet and professional counter-terrorism capability for the region.

Trump could also use America's influence in Iraq and Afghanistan to encourage secular and reformist politicians, instead of embracing, as both Bush and Obama did, any confressional parties that also gave lip service to opposing terrorism. He could use the bully pulpit to encourage Western civil societies to adopt newspaper editors, lawyers, human rights activists and others under threat from radicals in their own faith. Meanwhile, Trump could wind down what remains of Obama's first term agenda to build bridges to Muslim Brotherhood parties that have shown no real interest, with the exception of Tunisia, of accepting pluralism.

There are risks in embracing an ideological war against radical Islam, as opposed to a long war against terrorists. But it has the advantage of defining conditions for victory. The long war will end when Islamic fascism is defeated and discredited. What's more, Trump can set America on this path without engaging in the cycle of regime change and nation-building he has explicitly rejected. Not a bad plan for a guy who keeps asking why America doesn't win anymore.

MICKLETHWAIT: President Putin, thank you very much for talking to Bloomberg. We're here at Vladivostok, on the edge of the Pacific and on the eve of your second Eastern Economic forum. What do you hope to achieve at it?

PUTIN: It's a way to capture the attention of our partners, potential investors in Russia's Far East. In this sense, this event, this occasion is not much different from other regional forums of this kind. We hold a lot of them in Russia, such as the economic forum in St. Petersburg -- usually we hold that in the summer, at the beginning of summer -- or the economic forum in Sochi.

The Far East has particular importance for us, with priority given to the development of this region. In the past few years, let's even say in recent decades, we have encountered many problems here. We paid little attention to this area, and it deserves far more because enormous riches and opportunities for Russia's future development are concentrated here. Not only for the development of Russia itself, but the development of the whole Asia-Pacific region, because this land is very rich in natural and mineral resources.

Usually when we talk about the Far East, we have in mind the Far East proper: the Primorye region, the Khabarovsk region, Kamchatka, Chukotka. But it's also the area called Eastern Siberia. Now, if we take them all together, these lands contain colossal resources -- oil, gas, say, 90 percent of Russia's tin, 30 percent of Russia's gold, 35 percent of its timber. Seventy percent of Russia's fish are caught in these waters.

This is a region where the transport, rail infrastructure is well developed. And in recent years we have been busy developing the road network. There's huge potential! Opportunities for the development of the aviation industry, space industry. If you noticed, we opened a new cosmodrome in one of the regions of the Far East. Traditionally, aviation, as I said, has been developed here, including military aviation, -- the world famous Sukhoi fighter jet is manufactured in the Far East of Russia.

Finally, we have resumed the production of ships, especially for civilian use. Just today, I witnessed the start of work at one of the very promising platforms in this regard.

It's also a very good opportunity for humanitarian exchanges with our neighbors. We're proposing to develop musical activities, exhibitions, theatrical events here. Our outstanding musician and conductor Mr. Gergiev performed here very recently; we're opening a branch of St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theater here. We also plan to open branches of St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum here and the Vaganova Ballet Academy.

You and I are now in a building of the Far Eastern Federal University. I think you can also appreciate the scale of this academic institution. Thousands of young people from foreign countries study here, and there are many foreign teachers. We would very much like to see science, higher education, and learning developing here, so that it can become one of the prominent scientific centers in the entire Asia-Pacific region. Of course, there's still a lot that could be done here, but given the requirements of the labor market, the need for this kind of institution is obvious.

There's another area that's very interesting and promising for us - marine biology. One of the leading institutes of Russia's Academy of Sciences, for marine biology actually, has been here for many years, and we're opening a new center here. We also built an aquarium as part of it, which should become not only a venue for the public, who, I think, would enjoy getting closer to nature, but also be part of this marine biology institute. An interesting and very promising cluster is forming here, and we would like investors and our foreign colleagues, primarily from the Asia-Pacific region, to know more about it.

MICKLETHWAIT: One of the guests who have coming is Shinzo Abe. He's arriving at Vladivostok. There seems to be the beginnings of a political deal, if you like, where you might give up one of the Kuril Islands in exchange for greater economic cooperation? Are you open to a deal of that sort?

PUTIN: We don't trade territories, although the problem of a peace treaty with Japan is, of course, a key one. And we would very much like to find a solution to this problem with our Japanese friends. We had a treaty signed in 1956 and, surprisingly, it was ratified both by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and by the Japanese parliament, but then the Japanese side refused to adhere to it, and then the Soviet Union basically nullified all the agreements within this treaty.

Several years ago, our Japanese colleagues asked us to return to a discussion of this topic. And we did, we met them part way. Though in the past couple years -- not by our initiative, but from the Japanese side -- these talks were frozen, but now our partners are showing a willingness to resume discussing this subject. We're not talking about some swap or sales, we're talking about finding a solution where neither party would feel defeated or a loser.

MICKLETHWAIT: But, are you as close to a deal now as you have been since the 1960s? Is it better now than any time since then?

PUTIN: I don't think it's closer than in 1956, but, in any case, we've resumed a dialogue on this subject and agreed that our foreign ministers and the corresponding experts at the deputy-minister level will step up their work.

Of course, this will always be a topic of discussion for the Russian president and for the prime minister. I'm sure that when I meet with Mr. Abe in Vladivostok, we will also discuss this topic. But in order to resolve it, it should be very well thought out, prepared and, I repeat, not on the principle of damage limitation but rather on the principle of setting the stage for the development of inter-governmental relations for the long term.

MICKLETHWAIT: You seem to be more relaxed about territory on your Asian front. We mentioned the Kurils, you gave the island of Tarabarov back to China. You're not, you wouldn't consider giving Mrs. Merkel back Kaliningrad as a tribute?

PUTIN: We didn't give anything away. These were territories that were disputed, and we held negotiations with the People's Republic of China about them for 40 years and finally found a compromise. Part of the territory was permanently assigned to Russia and part of the territory permanently assigned to the People's Republic of China. I want to stress that this was possible only -- and this is very important -- against the backdrop of a very high level of trust that had been developed between Russia and China by that time. And if we can reach a similarly high level of trust with Japan, then we can find some compromises.

But there's a fundamental difference between the question connected with the Japanese story and, let's say, our negotiations with China. What is it? It's that the Japanese issue arose as a result of World War II and is set out in international documents linked to the results of the Second World War. Our discussions with our Chinese friends about border issues had nothing to do with World War II or any military conflict. This is the first, or rather, I should say, the second point.

Third, about the western part. You spoke of Kaliningrad.

MICKLETHWAIT: I meant it as a joke.

PUTIN: But I'll tell you without joking: if someone wants to start revisiting the results of World War II, well, let's try to debate that topic. But then we need to debate not only Kaliningrad but the whole thing, from the eastern part of Germany to Lviv, which was part of Poland, and so on and so forth. There's also Hungary and Romania. If someone wants to open that Pandora's box and start to work with it, go ahead. Take up the flag and go for it.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I ask you about the Chinese again. Back in 2013, you said you wanted to push trade with China up to $100 billion by 2015, $200 billion by 2020. And last year it went backward to about $67 billion-$70 billion a year. What went wrong? I know the problems with the ruble and problems with oil. But what went wrong, and do you still think that target of $200 billion in 2020 is achievable?

PUTIN: Yes, I think it's completely achievable, and you yourself identified the reason for the fall in trade. At first, we set a goal of $100 billion in trade, and we almost reached that figure, it was about $90 billion, so that figure was almost met. We know the reasons. They include the decline in prices for our traditional exports, they include the exchange rate. This is simple, objective data, you know that well.

MICKLETHWAIT: Did sanctions make a difference?

PUTIN: The sanctions and our relationship with China aren't connected at all, because we have built a relationship with the People's Republic of China that we consider to be at an unprecedented high, both in its level and quality, we call it a comprehensive partnership of strategic quality, and sanctions have nothing to do with it.

The decline in trade was due to objective issues connected with energy prices and the exchange rate, but physical volumes haven't fallen. They're actually growing. Our trade and economic relations with China are becoming more and more diversified, which is something we have consistently sought with our Chinese partners. Note that, in addition to trade purely in traditional goods, from one side, let's say, energy resources -- hydrocarbons, oil, and now natural gas and oil products -- and from the other, say, textiles and shoes, we've moved to a completely new level of cooperation.

We're already working, for example, on joint space programs, we're developing and will soon start production of a heavy helicopter. We're working on a wide-body long-haul airplane, we're cooperating in machine building, high-speed rail, in manufacturing, in timber processing, and atomic energy. We have already built the Tianwan nuclear power plant. Two reactors are already functioning, and running very well, and we'll build another two reactors. The goal that we've set for ourselves to diversify our relationship is being met.

MICKLETHWAIT: Just listening to you speak I wondered if you look back, you know, you became president first back in 2000. I wonder if you look back over that period whether you think Russia has become a little bit more an Asian country and a little bit less a European one?

PUTIN: You know, it's become a more developed country. You know, I don't want to draw a line between Asians and Europeans. The issue is on another level, on the level of development. The size of the Russian economy grew by 70 percent, nearly doubled. And by purchasing-power parity, Russia's economy is now currently the fifth or sixth-largest in the world.

It's completely clear that 10-15 years ago we couldn't have responded to the sanctions that were implemented against Russia with retaliatory measures, say, in agriculture. We couldn't have closed our market to agricultural goods from countries that acted in such an unfriendly manner toward Russia because we couldn't have supplied the domestic market with food of our own. And now we can. That's the first point.

Secondly, the freeing of our market gives our farmers an opportunity to increase production within the country. We had an overall decline in GDP connected to a whole series of events, not only sanctions, but also purely objective issues related to global economic trends; there's been a slight decline in GDP and industrial production. Yet agriculture is growing at 3 percent a year -- growing steadily. And that's stable growth. This year it will be 3 percent, maybe more, and next year too.

Therefore, if we're talking about what took place over, let's say, the last 15 years, then it's a lot. But that's not the only thing. Another thing is that the Russian economy has become significantly healthier. In 2000, we had $12 billion in gold and foreign-currency reserves and more than $20 billion in external debt.

Now Russia is among the top 10 countries with the healthiest ratio of external debt to reserves. On the first of last month we had nearly $400 billion in reserves, $395 billion, and foreign debt of only about 13 percent of GDP. That ratio is considered one of the best in the world.

We had a third of the population living below the poverty line, more than 40 million people. That number has now fallen by nearly two-thirds. Over the past year or year and a half, unfortunately, it has increased a bit given the economic difficulties and the overall decline in the population's wages, but it's still incomparable to what it was 15 years ago.

For example, pensions have increased several times over, real wages have grown, they're incomparable to what they were. These components got us to what we were fighting for, which is at the core of every state's development: demographics. In the early 2000s it seemed that we wouldn't be able to reverse the negative demographic trend. The population of Russia was declining by nearly 1 million people annually, 900,000 each year. Now over the last three years we've observed natural population growth. We have the lowest...

MICKLETHWAIT: You've encouraged romance.

PUTIN: To our credit, we now have the lowest level of infant mortality and maternal mortality in our recent history, and I think even going back to the Soviet period. We've set a goal to increase life expectancy. Over the past five years it's grown at a much higher rate than we planned. All of this gives us reason to believe that we were on the right track. Of course there's a lot we could and should still do and we probably could have attained greater results but on the whole we're moving in the right direction.

MICKLETHWAIT: You've just talked about the Russian economy and we'll come back and I'll ask you about reserves in just a second. But it struck me whilst you were talking, you know, you've detailed all the ways in which Russia has got stronger. You're about to go to the G-20. You have studied and watched the West many times. You've been to the G-20 more than any other leader at the moment.

Have you ever been to a G-20 where the West has seemed more divided, more in doubt, more distrustful in itself. Look at all the things happening in Europe -- the migration, you look at the Brexit, you look at America with all the election and the problems with that. Does the West seem particularly disunited at the moment to you? What do explain that by?

PUTIN: There are many problems in the world economy on the whole, and the economy in the West also has a lot of problems: an aging population, declining productivity growth rates -- these are obvious things. On the whole, such demographics are very difficult. Then, the experts -- and you are one of the best experts in this subject -- surely think that the EU's expansion policy didn't account for the readiness of this or that economy to join the euro zone, for example.

It's very difficult to support growth rates and protect the economy itself from hardship after joining a single currency with fairly weak economic indicators. We in Europe weren't the only ones to experience this. For example, take Argentina, where 10 years ago, or maybe more, they tightly pegged the national currency to the dollar and then didn't know what do to. And that's what entering the euro zone was like...

MICKLETHWAIT: Do you expect the euro to survive?

PUTIN: I hope so. I hope so because, first of all, we believe in the foundations of the European economy. We see that west European leaders in general -- there are disagreements of course, which is understandable, we see, observe, analyze -- but they stick to very pragmatic approaches to resolving economic issues. We can't say whether they're right or wrong. It depends on your perspective.

They don't misuse financial instruments or liquidity. They primarily strive for structural changes. In fact, the same problems are no less acute in our economy, perhaps even more so. I'm referring to a problem that we can't overcome, specifically the dominant role of the oil and gas sector in Russia and, as a result, our dependence on oil and gas revenue.

But in Europe, without dependence on oil and gas, they've also needed structural reforms for a long time. I think that the leading economies have taken a very pragmatic and intelligent approach to resolving the economic problems facing Europe. That's why we hold about 40 percent of our gold and foreign currency reserves in euros.

MICKLETHWAIT: You expect the euro to survive and you expect Europe to keep the existing membership, they are not going to lose any more, they are not going to lose another country like they lost Britain?

PUTIN: You know, I don't want to respond to your provocative question, even though I understand that it could be interesting.

MICKLETHWAIT: Come on, many, many times you've criticized Europe. You could take some...

PUTIN: I've been critical, but I'll repeat: we hold 40 percent of our reserves in euros, and it's not in our interest for the euro zone to collapse. Although I don't rule out that there could be some decisions made that would consolidate a group of countries with equal levels of development and thereby, in my opinion, strengthening the euro. But there might be some other interim decisions in order to preserve the current number of euro-zone members.

It's not really up to us, but we always very attentively monitor and wish our European partners success. What you said about criticism, I criticized their foreign policy, but that doesn't mean that we should agree on everything. We have criticized many things and believe that our partners have made more than a few mistakes, as probably we have too. Nobody is safe from these mistakes, but in regards to the economy I'll say it again: in my opinion, the European Commission and the leading economies of Europe are acting pragmatically and are on the right track.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can we talk about the Russian economy, then. You mentioned... Let's maybe begin with the exchange rate. I know you will say that the exchange rate, a lot depends on the central bank and the exchange rate is set by the market. But I saw back in July, on July the 19th when the ruble was at 62.8 to the dollar you said the ruble was too strong, you criticized that. And the ruble has now come down to 65 to the dollar. Has it weakened enough to make you happy? Or do you want to see it weaken a bit further?

PUTIN: I didn't criticize the central bank's position. I really have always believed, and believe, that the central bank should act independently. In fact, that is how it acts, you can believe me. I don't interfere with central bank decisions and I don't issue any directives to the leadership of the central bank or the governor of the central bank. The central bank looks at what's happening in the economy and, of course, I'm in contact with the governing members and the governor.

But I never give directives. And if I say that the ruble strengthened too much, I'm not saying that the central bank's position is wrong. I'm saying that this is imposing an additional burden on the export-oriented parts of the economy. We are well aware that's the case. When the ruble is weaker, it's easier to sell. You can produce here with cheap rubles, and sell for expensive dollars and earn large revenues in dollars, and then convert them to rubles and make a big profit. These are basic things.

But if we talk about the fundamentals, then the issue of regulating the exchange rate is decided by the main regulator -- specifically, the central bank. Of course, it should consider how the economy and industry will react, but it should also consider its fundamental goals and provide a stable exchange rate.

The main issue is the exchange rate's stability, and this, in one way or another, the central bank manages to ensure, despites all the nuances, and it was finally able to do so after the central bank switched to a floating exchange rate for the national currency. But the central bank should also consider other things. The stability of the country's banking system, how the money supply is growing or contracting in the economy, and how that's influencing inflation. There are many components that the central bank needs to consider, and it's best not to interfere in its competencies.

MICKLETHWAIT: But do you personally, would you like to see the ruble be a little bit weaker still, would that help the Russian economy in your view? I know it's not your job but you made a comment before. Where do you stand now?

PUTIN: You know, my position is that the rate should correspond to the level of the economy's development. So there's always a balance, a balance of interests, and this balance should be reflected. A balance between those who sell something overseas, who benefit from a weaker rate, and the interests of those who buy, who need a stronger rate. Balancing the interests of producers inside the country, for example agricultural producers, since 40 million Russian citizens are connected with our rural areas one way or another. This is very important.

But we also can't forget about the interests of ordinary consumers, who need the prices in shops to be a little bit lower. So, I repeat, the rate shouldn't be oriented toward a specific group or one or two groups. It should correspond to the fundamental interests of the development of the economy itself.

MICKLETHWAIT: So you are no longer complaining. So I will take it that you are not too unhappy where it is... What about reserves?

PUTIN: But I didn't express dissatisfaction and didn't complain. I simply pointed out that one group - exporters - would benefit from a weaker rate.

MICKLETHWAIT: On the question of reserves, you mentioned them earlier... Russia used to have $500 billion. You came down to 400. A lot better than when you came in, but down to 400. You have this target to go back up to $500 billion. What do you think is a realistic target to aim for and in your opinion should the central bank be buying more dollars in order to push it back up toward that $500 billion?

PUTIN: The central bank is constantly buying, buying and selling, buying and selling. That's their job. I believe the gold and currency reserves have risen by 14 percent in the past half year.

MICKLETHWAIT: They've gone back up a little bit, but they haven't been buying dollars in the same systematic way as they did once.

PUTIN: You and I know, about the necessary amount of central bank reserves, and the target is well known. But for the general public we can say that the point of the central bank's gold and foreign currency reserves isn't to finance the economy, but to guarantee foreign trade. And for that we need a level that's sufficient to support foreign trade of a country the size of Russia for at least three months.

But we're at a level that that can support our trade turnover for, at minimum, half a year or more, if everything stops working and we only use our gold and currency reserves. So that's more than enough.

From the viewpoint of safeguarding stability of the economy and foreign trade, we absolutely have enough gold and foreign-currency reserves. And everything else -- the buying and selling of currency -- is related to the regulation of the domestic currency market. But how the central bank reacts to this, whether it will lead to an increase in the reserves, it's so far difficult to say. Let's not forget that we have two governmental reserve funds: the Reserve Fund itself and the National Wellbeing Fund. And together they make up about $100 billion.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I ask you about the oil price - your favorite subject. Almost two years ago you said that if the crude oil fell below $80 a barrel there would be a collapse in oil production. Well, the price is still below $50 and production hasn't stopped. Has your thinking changed on that at all?

PUTIN: Well, if I said that oil output would cease, then I was mistaken. I really don't remember where I said that, probably in the heat of the moment. I don't think I said that. But maybe I just don't remember. I said that new deposits probably wouldn't be commissioned at a certain oil price. Strictly speaking, that is what happened.

But perhaps even surprisingly, our oil and gas companies, mainly the oil companies, are continuing to invest. In the past year, the oil companies have invested 1.5 trillion rubles, and if you take the state's investment in the pipeline network and electricity sector, then the overall investment in energy is 3.5 trillion rubles in the past year. That's quite significant.

Our oil output and electricity production are increasing. Production has declined a little, I think by about 1 percent in... By the way, we are the world's leader in terms of natural gas exports, with a global share of about 20 percent.

In the export of liquid hydrocarbons, we're also among the leaders, we've been first in liquid hydrocarbon exports. Even though we're still first in gas exports, our internal production has slipped a little, but this is due to an increase in hydropower output. Demand for gas from thermal power stations has dropped somewhat. That's the result of the restructuring of the situation on our domestic energy market. On the whole, Gazprom is in great shape and is increasing exports to its traditional partner-countries.

MICKLETHWAIT: You're going to talk to the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince at the G-20 Mohammed bin Salman. Would you still be in favor of a production freeze if the Saudis want that?

PUTIN: Mr. Salman, as far as I know, is the deputy crown prince, but that's a detail. He is a very energetic statesman, and we really have struck up a friendly relationship. This is a man who knows what he wants and knows how to achieve his goals. But at the same time, I consider him a very reliable partner with whom you can reach agreements, and can be certain that those agreements will be honored.

But still, we weren't the ones who rejected the idea of freezing output levels. It was our Saudi partners who at the last moment changed their view and decided to take a pause in taking this decision. But I want to repeat: our position hasn't changed and if Prince Salman and I speak about this, then I shall, of course, put forward our position again.

We believe that this is the right decision for world energy. That's the first thing. The second thing is that everyone knows what the dispute was about. The dispute was that if production were to be frozen, then everyone should do it, including Iran. But we understand that Iran is starting from a very low level, related to the well-known sanctions against this country. It would be unfair to leave it at this sanctioned level.

I think that from the viewpoint of economic sense and logic, then it would be correct to find some sort of compromise. I am confident that everyone understands that. The issue isn't economic, it's political. I would very much like to hope that every participant of this market that's interested in maintaining stable and fair global energy prices will in the end make the necessary decision.

MICKLETHWAIT: So you would be in favor of a production freeze but giving Iran a little bit of leeway to do what they need to do?

PUTIN: Yes.

MICKLETHWAIT: I just want to jump back. One effect of the oil price and of all these different things is on your budget. You have budget deficit, you have just given some more money which you mentioned earlier to pensioners. You will have to go and borrow money at some time. Are you likely to go this year? And will you go to the domestic market or will you go to the international market to borrow money?

PUTIN: There's no need yet, we don't need to borrow on international markets. Although, this is a traditional instrument of international finance, we always use it and we're using it now. We have had sales and there have been enough people willing to buy our financial instruments. We simply don't have the need today with the government's reserve funds of about $100 billion. This is pointless, bearing in mind the cost of borrowing. You always need to look carefully. By the way, borrowing is also possible. You just have to understand what is more advantageous at the given moment. That's the first thing.

Second, as far as the deficit goes, last year the federal budget deficit was 2.6 percent, which is a fairly acceptable level. This year we expect that it will be a little bit bigger, somewhere in the region of 3 percent, maybe three and a bit. This is also an acceptable size.

But what path have we chosen? We've chosen to take the path of optimizing budget spending. In these difficult conditions, we, in my view, have taken a very pragmatic approach to resolving the economic and social issues. We're tackling the main social issues and are fulfilling our promises to the public.

Just recently the government announced we had indexed the pension by 4 percent, but won't index it in the second half of the year, instead making a one-time payment at the start of next year. We'll make a one-time payment of 5,000 rubles to every pensioner, which is basically commensurable.

We're acting very pragmatically, very cautiously. We're cutting expenses on those items that we don't see as priorities and aren't going to mindlessly throw away our reserves, or mindlessly burn through them for some political ambition. We'll act very cautiously and, I hope, at any rate, that we'll have no particular need to seek financing from overseas.

Note, our trade surplus fell, but remains positive. We had last year, I think for the first half of this year a trade surplus of $45 billion. Compared with last year, inflation has slowed considerably, significantly. If we look at August, we had inflation around 10 percent last year, and now it's a bit above 3 percent. Unemployment remains at quite an acceptable level:

5.7 percent.

Our macroeconomic indicators are stable and this gives me grounds to think and hope that we shall calmly and confidently get through this difficult period for our economy, which certainly has already adapted to the current conditions.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I ask you about privatization and oil again? The privatization of Bashneft -- you've delayed it. And now as we reported Igor Sechin of Rosneft has come forward and said he would like to buy half of it for $5 billion. But you have always said that you don't want the big state companies to be buying the newly privatized ones. You wouldn't allow that, would you?

PUTIN: You spoke just now of state companies. Rosneft, strictly speaking, isn't a state company. Let's not forget that

19.7 percent of it belongs to BP, which, by the way, is a British company. You're a British subject, so you're essentially, you're also...

MICKLETHWAIT: I think you may have more control over Rosneft than Theresa May has over BP.

PUTIN: Yes, we may have more control, but, strictly speaking, it's not a state company. I wanted to say that I think this is a clear fact: 19.7 percent belongs to a foreign investor, but nevertheless, given that the controlling stake belongs to the state, probably it's not the best option when one company under state control acquires another purely state company. That's one position.

The second, in the end, the important thing for the budget is who gives the most money in the sale that's supposed to be organized as part of the privatization process. And in this sense, we can't discriminate against market participants, not a single one of them. But it's not relevant at the moment, as the government decided to delay Bashneft's privatization.

MICKLETHWAIT: So that's gone. But on the question of privatization, you said back in 2012 that you wanted to expand privatization. You've had a difficult time of it. Why has that not worked? Is there a case, why does the Russian government need to own 50 percent of these companies? Maybe you could sell more?

PUTIN: The Russian government has no need to hold such large stakes and we are committed to carrying out our plans. The question isn't whether we want to or not, it's whether it makes sense or not, and at what moment?

On the whole this makes sense from at least one point of view, from the standpoint of structural changes in the economy. The state really is perhaps too big in the Russian economy now. But in a falling market, even from the point of view of fiscal interests, it doesn't always make sense, so we're taking it carefully. But our trend, from the standpoint of privatization and the state's gradual withdrawal from certain assets, is unchanged and will remain unchanged.

By the way, you mentioned Rosneft. We're actively preparing to privatize part of our Rosneft stake. This is the best confirmation that we haven't changed our fundamental plans.

For example, one of the world's largest diamond producers is a Russian company, and we sold a stake in it.

MICKLETHWAIT: Alrosa?

PUTIN: Alrosa. We're working the same way in other areas. So we aren't changing our fundamental position. It's just not a moment when we should, as we say, bustle about, that is, react nervously like we must do it immediately at any price. No, we're not going to do that at any price. We should do it with the maximum effect for the Russian state, for the Russian economy.

MICKLETHWAIT: So you would do Rosneft this year? You would sell those shares in Rosneft this year you hope?

PUTIN: We're preparing for this deal this year. I don't know whether the government will be able to prepare and do this deal together with Rosneft's management, whether appropriate strategic investors will be found. I think that we should be talking about precisely such investors, but we're preparing and planning to do the deal this year.

MICKLETHWAIT: And do you, do you, again just to push you on that 50 percent, would you be happy in a world where the Russian state had less than 50 percent of these big companies?

PUTIN: We don't see anything horrible in this. You know I remember that we had one company, I won't name it now, but when foreign shareholders took 50 percent of it, foreign investors, the contributions to the federal budget, tax payments increased several times immediately and the company's efficiency didn't deteriorate at all. So from the viewpoint of the state's interests, the end interests of the state, from the standpoint of its fiscal interests, we have a more positive than negative experience.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I push you a bit on this? Because when I look on your record over all these years, in foreign policy you've been very aggressive, very decisive, very bold and everyone agree on that. On economic policy you seem a little more timid.

PUTIN: I won't agree with that. I acted decisively but not aggressively, I acted in line with the circumstances that arose.

MICKLETHWAIT: So bold, decisive.

PUTIN: I acted in accordance with the circumstances.

MICKLETHWAIT: But on the economy by contrast you've been slightly more, you have been less decisive, in terms of pushing reforms through. If you look at countries like China and Vietnam, you know, they have changed their economies completely. Russia, as you've said, is still one dependent on oil, still dependent on a few companies, still run largely by the same people. Do you think that's been a sort of failing throughout those years that you have not reformed enough?

PUTIN: No, I don't think so. And moreover, we.... Look, we held a land reform. It was hard to imagine that this would be possible in Russia. Note that, unlike many countries in the world with a very developed market economy, our, say, oil sector, it is almost fully privatized. You just mentioned Rosneft and Bashneft, and the rest are private companies. And look what's happening in this sector in Saudi Arabia, in Mexico, and in many other oil-producing countries. Why do you think Russia has made less progress toward these reforms?

Another thing is that with high oil prices it's very hard to redirect economic players from industries where they get big profits, and to encourage them to invest money and resources in other areas. For this we need to implement a whole, pursue a whole set of measures. We are doing that gradually. Unfortunately, the effect may not be as significant as we would like it to be....

One moment, I'll finish. A bit of patience. But still there's a result.

So look, the year before last oil and gas revenue accounted for 53 percent of budget revenue, this is the year before last, in 2014, and in 2015 it was 43 percent, and this year it will be about 36 percent. So, structural changes are also taking place, and it's not only about the price, but also about the distribution, about economic growth, about the expansion of certain industries. Say for example, we're seeing industrial production growth across the country at 0.3 percent. Not much, but it's something. But, say, in the Far East, where we are now, industrial production growth -- industrial, specifically -- is

5.4 percent.

MICKLETHWAIT: Let me give you an example. You've recently made changes on the political side within your administration. If I look at the business, if I look at a company like Gazprom, for instance, I just checked in dollar terms, Gazprom is worth less than a fifth of what it was ten years ago, and it's fallen from being in top-10 companies in the world to the 198th. And you've had the same manager, running it for 15 years - Alexey Miller -you've now given him another 5-year contract. What I'm saying, you're not as tough on business people who are running the oil side as you might be on other people. Why have you put up with this? You're famously efficient man.

PUTIN: Listen, Gazprom is clearly undervalued. This is an absolutely obvious fact. We have no plan to sell it yet. And this is because of the peculiarities of the Russian economy, the social sphere and Russian energy industry. One of Gazprom's functions is to ensure the country gets through the peak periods of autumn and winter, to supply Russia's big power companies. And it fulfils this function.

I think Gazprom's valuations today are quite speculative. This absolutely doesn't worry us or bother us. We know what Gazprom is, what it's worth and what it will be worth in the coming years, despite, for example, the development of shale gas in the United States or in other regions of the world. Pipeline gas will always be cheaper. And Gazprom is increasing its exports to traditional partner countries, to Europe. Look at Gazprom's reports, especially for the past few months -- sales are rising.

I'm certain this will be the case in the future. Why? Because in the near future, despite the development of alternative energy, when you look at the economics and environmental standards, then there's no other source of primary energy in the world than natural gas. Well, perhaps there is nuclear energy but there are also a lot of issues there and there are opponents of nuclear energy. Gas doesn't have those opponents. But there is a country that is, obviously, the world leader in gas reserves. That's our country, the Russian Federation.

And Gazprom carries out all the functions that it has been assigned, that management has been assigned. Of course, there are issues and there are problems. We see them. I know that Gazprom's management is taking the necessary steps to resolve these issues and that it fights for its interests on world markets. Whether it does that well or poorly? That's another question.

Many criticize it, they say that it needed to be more flexible, that it should have switched to a floating price depending on the current state of the economy, but the gas business is very specific. It's not even like trading oil. It's a separate business that's linked to big investments in output and transportation, and this means that production structures must be sure that they can sell at a certain price.

You can of course agree with partners on some kind of floating limits depending on certain conditions. I think this could also be the subject of negotiations. But, if, for example, our European partners want to guarantee their competitiveness on world markets, they should themselves ultimately be interested in long-term contracts with Gazprom.

Look, when prices were high, how many complaints were made against Gazprom about how it needed to do something to lower the upper plank of prices a bit? Now oil prices have fallen, but gas prices are tied to oil and for some reason no one is raising the question about whether gas prices need to be raised. Everyone is fine with it. There are natural contradictions between sellers and buyers, but there are some frameworks within which they can agree to minimize their risks. But, probably, they can talk about this.

MICKLETHWAIT: But all the same, I know you're a generous man, but if you had a general who had lost 80 percent of his army, you might not keep him as a general. Gazprom still has the export monopoly, you wouldn't think of taking it away from them, given that performance, because it is worse than other gas companies.

PUTIN: Listen, that's a different story. If we were talking about a general, then the general in this case has lost nothing, he's sent troops into reserves, which can be called back at any moment and put to use.

MICKLETHWAIT: The G-20. This will be one of the last times you will see Barack Obama. And as you well know, there is an American election underway, and as you well know, there is a choice in that between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Who would you rather have at the other end of the telephone if there is a geopolitical situation - Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Do you have a feeling at all?

PUTIN: I would like to work with a person who can make responsible decisions and implement any agreements that we reach. Their last name doesn't matter. Of course, it's necessary for that person to enjoy the trust of the American people, so that they won't just have the desire but also the reinforced political will to fulfill all those agreements. That's why we never interfered, don't intervene and try not to intervene in domestic political processes. We'll closely monitor what happens and wait for the election results. And then we'll be ready to work with any administration if the administration itself wants that.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I just push you on that? Back in 2011, you accused Hillary Clinton of seeking to trigger the protests that you were facing in Russia at the time. And by contrast, when I look at some of things that Donald Trump has said about you... Back in 2007, he said Putin is doing a great job, in 2011 he praised your no-nonsense way, the next year he said you were his new best friend, next year he said you're outsmarting the Americans, he said you have good ratings together ...

I could go on and on like that. And you are really telling me that if you have a choice between a woman, who you think may have been trying to get rid of you, and a man, who seems to have this great sort of affection for you, almost sort of bordering on the homoerotic, you are really going to go for, you are not going to make a decision between those two, because one of them would seem to be a lot more favorable towards you?

PUTIN: You know, I essentially already answered your question. I'll reformulate it again, say it in different words. We are ready to work with any president, but, of course -- I also said this -- to the extent that the future administration is ready. If someone says that they want to work with Russia, we'll welcome it. And if someone, as you said -- although it may be an inaccurate translation -- wants to get rid of us, that will be a completely different approach. But we will survive it, and it's not clear who has more to lose with that approach.

But the thing is, I've repeatedly seen the anti-Russian card played during domestic political campaigns in the States. I think that it's a very short-sighted approach. At the same time, they send us all sorts of signals from all sides that actually things are just fine. With previous administrations, that's the way it was during the campaign. That we'll restore everything later. You know, it seems to me that it doesn't fully meet the level of responsibility that lies on the shoulders of the U.S. I think that all this should be more dignified, calm and more balanced.

As for the fact that someone is criticizing us, you know, criticism is leveled at us by Mr. Trump's team as well. For example, one of the members of his team said that we paid, that Russia allegedly paid money to the Clinton family via some foundations. What's that? Does that mean that we control the Clinton family? It's complete nonsense, I don't even know where Bill spoke and through which funds. So both one side and the other are using it as a tool, using it as a tool in a domestic political struggle, and that's bad in my opinion. But, obviously, when someone says that they want to work with Russia, we'll welcome it. Regardless of that person's surname.

MICKLETHWAIT: Very quickly: the other accusation you've faced -- or that they've said a lot -- is that people connected with Russia or backed by Russia were the people who hacked into the Democratic Party's database. Is that, you would also say that is completely untrue?

PUTIN: No, I don't know anything about that. You know how many hackers there are today and they act so delicately and precisely that they can leave their mark at the necessary time and place or even not their own mark, camouflaging their activity as that of some other hackers from other territories or countries. It's an extremely difficult thing to check, if it's even possible to check. At any rate, we definitely don't do this at the state level.

And then, listen, does it even matter who hacked this data from the campaign headquarters of Mrs. Clinton? Is that really important? The important thing is the content that was given to the public. There should be a discussion about this, and there's no need to distract the public's attention from the essence of the problem by raising some side issues connected with the search for who did it.

But I want to tell you again, I don't know anything about it, and on a state level Russia has never done this. And to be honest, I couldn't even imagine that this sort of information is interesting to American society -- specifically that the campaign headquarters worked in the interests of one of the candidates, in this case Mrs. Clinton, rather than equally for all of the Democratic Party candidates. It would simply not even occur to me that this could be interesting to anyone. So even from this point of view, we couldn't have officially penetrated it.

You understand, to do that you need to have a finger on the pulse and understand the specifics of domestic political life in the U.S. I'm not sure that even our Foreign Ministry experts are sensitive enough.

MICKLETHWAIT: Do you not think, this is sort of time when everyone should sort of come clean about it? You know, Russia tries to hack America, America tries to hack Russia, China tries to hack America, China tries to hack Russia. Everyone tries to hack each other. That one of the purposes of the G-20 is to come up with a new set of rules so this can become a more ordered version of foreign policy when everybody is doing it. Allegedly.

PUTIN: I think that it would be better for the G-20 not to get involved as there are other venues for this. The G-20 was formed as a platform to discuss issues mainly concerning the global economy.

If we are going to add to that -- of course politics influence the economic process, that's a clear fact -- but if we add some squabbles or not squabbles but very serious issues that relate purely to world politics, then we'll overwhelm the G-20's agenda. And then instead of working on the issues of finance, structural changes to the economy, taxation and so on, in place of that, we'll endlessly argue about Syria's problems or some other world problems -- and there are plenty -- then we'll talk about the Middle East. It's better to find other venues and other forums and there are plenty. The UN Security Council, for example.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I ask you one last question on Donald Trump. Some people say that he is to? volatile to be an American president. You would be happy with him as American president in the same way as you would be happy with Hillary Clinton in that role.

PUTIN: You know, we can't answer for the American people. After all, with all the shock tactics of not only one but the other candidate, they are both busy using shock tactics, just each in their own way.

They are smart, they are very smart people. They understand which buttons they need to press a bit so that the voters of the United States understand, feel and listen to them. Trump is focusing on the traditional Republican electorate, the average man, people with average incomes, the working class, a select group of business people, and people who support traditional values. Mrs. Clinton is focusing on a different part of the electorate and is trying to influence them in her own way. So that's why they attack each other. In some cases, I wouldn't want us to follow their lead. I don't think they are setting the best example.

But that's the U.S. political culture. You have to just accept it as it is. America is a powerful country and it has earned the right that nobody from the outside can interfere with it or comment on it. To answer your question for a third time, we will work with any administration, with any president who will win the support of the American people, if of course they are ready to cooperate with Russia.

MICKLETHWAIT: Let me ask you about another country. Another person you're going to meet at the G-20: Theresa May. Britain has ended up in the same situation as Russia, it is in Europe, but not, likely not to be in European Union. Will you approach them with a free-trade deal?

PUTIN: Look, to finish my answer to the previous question: You've been working in journalism for many years, you're very well-informed and you understand all the threats linked to the deterioration of the international situation, right? Especially between the biggest nuclear powers. We all understand that. Of course, it's you interviewing me, and not vice versa. But I'll allow myself to ask you. Do you want to see an escalation to the level of the Cuban Missile Crisis? No?

MICKLETHWAIT: No, nobody does.

PUTIN: No, of course not, no one wants that.

MICKLETHWAIT: But that is one reason why I asked about Donald Trump because he is seen as a more unpredictable force than Hillary Clinton.

PUTIN: You surely would also want for Russia to have good relations with the U.K. and the U.S. Am I right? And I also want that. And if someone in the U.S. says ""I want to establish good relations with Russia,"" then we need to welcome that -- you and I, and people like me and people like you. And what's going to happen in reality, what's going to happen after the elections, we don't know yet. And that's why I'm saying that we will work with any president that the American people elect.

As for the U.K., we have a meeting scheduled with the prime minister in China on the sidelines of the G-20. We've spoken by phone. Unfortunately, relations between Russia and the U.K. haven't been the best lately, but that's not our fault, we didn't scale back our relations with the U.K. It was the U.K. that decided to freeze our mutual contacts in many areas. If the British side thinks that there's a need for dialogue in some areas, then we're ready, we aren't going to pout or be mad at someone, we're very pragmatic about cooperation with our partners, and see it as beneficial for our two countries.

We've talked about our biggest oil company, Rosneft. And I've already mentioned at the beginning that about 20 percent of it, 19.7 percent, belongs to BP -- whose company is that? British Petroleum, right? Perhaps, that's already not bad. I must say that British Petroleum's capitalization is meaningfully tied to the fact that it owns more than 19 percent of Rosneft, which has large reserves in Russia and abroad. That has an effect on the company's stability. BP landed in a tough situation after the well-known tragic events in the Gulf of Mexico, and we did everything to support it. Is Britain not interested in that? I think it is.

And the same goes for other areas. Right now we're celebrating the anniversary of the Arctic Convoys. Do you know about that, yes? We really -- and I'm not saying this to sound good -- we see the veterans of the Arctic Convoys as heroes. They were heroes indeed. We know in what conditions they fought, in the most challenging ones. They faced death every time for the sake of our common victory. And we remember that.

MICKLETHWAIT: Do you think Britain might be more compliant or more likely to do a deal with Russia now it is outside or going to leave the European Union?

PUTIN: The U.K. is leaving and has practically left the European Union, but it hasn't exited its special relationship with the U.S. I think the U.K.'s relations with Russia depend not on its presence or absence from the EU, but on its special relationship with the U.S. If it conducts a more independent foreign policy, then, perhaps, it would be possible to achieve. If Britain will be guided by a commitment to its allies and will think that this is of greater national interest than cooperation with Russia, then let it be that way.

It's not our choice at the end of the day. It's the choice of our British partners. It's a choice of priorities. But in any case, we understand that in light of relations with the U.S., Britain in its relations with Russia will need to take into consideration the opinion of its key partner, the U.S. We see this reality as a given. But I'll repeat that as far as the U.K., will be ready to go in its renewal of the partnership with us, that's how far we'll be ready to go as well. This doesn't depend on us.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I ask you about one last person in the G-20: President Erdogan. You didn't protest that much when Turkish tanks rolled across the Syrian border the other day. You know, why? Do you think Turkey has now moved closer to your idea that the future of Syria has to involve President Assad staying in some way or have you changed your mind about President Erdogan. Only a little bit ago you were complaining that you had been stabbed in the back and you had the problems to do with the jet being shot down. Has something changed in Turkey in terms of what you can see?

PUTIN: First off, we're operating on the basis that Turkey apologized for the incident that took place and for the death of our people. It did it directly, without any reservations, and we value that. President Erdogan took this step. We see a clear interest on the part of Turkey's president in restoring full-scale relations with Russia.

We have many common interests in the Black Sea region and more globally, and in the Middle East. We very much expect that we'll be able to establish a constructive dialogue. We have many big projects, including Turkish Stream in the energy sector. And I think that ultimately we'll complete it, at least the first part relating to expanding transport capacity and boosting deliveries to the domestic Turkish market. There will be the possibility of transit to European partners, again, if they want it and if the European Commission supports it.

We have a large project to build a nuclear power station on unique terms. They consist of several elements: We will finance, own and operate it. This uniqueness gives us reason to believe that the project is realistic, taking into account the agreements on its economic terms, which are based on the price of a kilowatt hour of energy. This will be an economically beneficial project for both sides.

In addition to everything else, as I already said, we have a mutual desire to come to an agreement about the region's problems, including the Syrian one. I continue to believe that nothing can be decided externally about the political regime or a change of power. When I hear someone saying that some president must go, not domestically but externally, it raises major questions for me.

I am simply sure and I get this confidence from the events of the last decade, specifically the attempts at democratizing Iraq and attempts at democratizing Libya. We see that in fact led to the collapse of statehood and the growth of terrorism. Where do you see elements of democracy in Libya? Maybe they will emerge eventually, I very much count on it. Or the continuing civil war in Iraq. And what will happen in general with Iraq in the future? So far these are big questions.

It's the same with Syria. When we hear that Assad should go, for some reason someone peripheral thinks so, I have a big question: what will it lead to, will it be in line with international legal standards and what will it lead to? Wouldn't it be better to be patient and facilitate changes to the structure of the society itself, to muster this patience, allowing changes to the structure of the society, waiting for when these changes happen naturally within the country? Of course it won't happen today or tomorrow. Maybe that's what political wisdom is, not rushing or getting ahead of yourself, but gradually working toward structural change. In this case, within the society's political system.

In regards to Turkey's actions: We are in contact with our Turkish partners, and we consider everything that violates international law to be unacceptable. But we are in contact on a political level and at the level of the Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry. And I'm sure that at the meeting with Turkey's president, Mr. Erdogan, in China we'll also discuss this.

MICKLETHWAIT: Very quickly on Syria. Are we any closer to having a Russian-American deal about how, a plan for what to happen with Syria. You've had talks recently. It seems that you've got a little bit closer, but is there any progress on that? And do you think we're closer to that than we have been?

PUTIN: You know, the talks are very difficult. One of the key problems is that we insist, and our U.S. partners are not opposed to this, that the so-called healthy part of the opposition should be separated from the radical groups and terrorist organizations such as Jabhat al-Nusra, while we get the impression that Jabhat al-Nusra and the like are hiding under other names, they already call themselves differently, but in fact nothing is actually changing -- they are starting to absorb the so-called healthy part of opposition and there is nothing good in this.

Besides, this is not an element of the internal conflict; these are foreign fighters, who get arms and ammunition from abroad. And in essence our American partners agree with this, but they don't know what to do about it. Nevertheless, despite all these difficulties, we're on the right track and I have to mention that Secretary of State Kerry has certainly done colossal work. I'm surprised by both his patience and determination.

But nevertheless, in my opinion, we're gradually, gradually heading in the right direction, and I don't rule out that we'll be able to agree on something in the near future and present our agreements to the international community. It's too early to talk about this, but I think, as I said, we're working in the right direction.

MICKLETHWAIT: If you look back over all the time you've been president, you could argue the relationship with the West has had all these problems to do with trust... And we can go through each of the individual conflicts. But when you look back over that period in the way that relationship with the West has not always worked, do you think there are things looking back you would have done differently if you would had known about it?

PUTIN: No, I wouldn't do anything differently. I think that our partners should have done a lot of things differently. When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, a new Russia emerged; we just opened our arms to our partners in the West. Remember at least what it cost us, the gesture to reveal our bugging systems at the American Embassy in Moscow. Nobody has done anything similar to that, do you think that CIA has no bugging devices somewhere with us? Of course, they have. Moreover, they've intensified their work.

We, for example, halted flights of our strategic aviation along U.S. borders. We didn't make any flights for a decade. But the U.S. didn't stop, they've kept flying. Why? We've said that we were ready to create new European security systems involving the United States. Instead, the process of NATO expansion closer to our borders began. One stage, and then a second.

We spoke about the need to solve problems connected with missile defense systems together and to keep or modernize the anti-missile treaty. The United States unilaterally withdrew from the ABM treaty and pursued the intensive development of a strategic anti-missile system, precisely strategic systems, as part of their strategic nuclear forces. They have been deployed on the periphery, and construction work was started on missile-defense facilities in Romania and then Poland. At the time, initially, you remember that this was done citing the Iranian nuclear threat. Then Iran signed the agreement, the United States among others ratified it, and there's no threat, but the missile-defense facilities are still being built.

The question is against whom? They told us then that it's not against you. We responded, ""then we'll improve our own strike systems."" We were told -- ""do what you want, but we'll think that it's not against us.""

We are doing this and we now see that when something starts to get going for us our partners start becoming worried. They think what's going on there? Why was there such a response? Because no one thought, probably, that we were capable of doing it.

We started from the early 2000s against the backdrop of the complete collapse of Russia's defense complex, against the backdrop, to put it mildly, of our Armed Forces' low military capabilities, and it crossed no one's mind that we would be able to restore the Armed Forces' military potential and resurrect the military-industrial complex. We had observers from the United States, you know about this, who sat in our nuclear weapons factories; they sat right in the factories. That was the level of trust. Then the steps followed: first, second, third and fourth.

Well, should we respond to this somehow? And we're told all the time: this isn't your business, this doesn't concern you, and it's not against you. And that's not even mentioning the sensitive period of our history, of the difficult times in the Caucasus, in the Chechen Republic. You're a journalist, you know how the West's political establishment reacted. And the press. Would you call that support for the lawful Russian authorities and bolstering the statehood? No, absolutely the opposite. It was support for separatism and, in essence, terrorism, because no one wanted to hear that al-Qaeda was fighting on the side of the militants and separatists. We were told not to worry, 'we're just thinking about the development of democracy in your country.' Thanks so much for that concern.

But nevertheless we're favorably disposed, we understand the logic of the political and geopolitical struggle. We're ready for cooperation if our partners are ready for such cooperation.

MICKLETHWAIT: If I had to look at the West and to sum up where they think, their side of the argument would be, that they, I think, at the root of their distrust is the idea that they think that you want to expand Russia's zone of influence, in some cases geographically, but at the very least to control the countries on your border. And at the moment, the main area of nervousness on that is the Baltics -- Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia. Would you be able to... You talked about the trust... Would you be able to say something that would give them reassurance on that count?

PUTIN: I think all sober-minded people who really are involved in politics understand that the idea of a Russian threat to, for example, the Baltics is complete madness. Are we really about to fight NATO? How many people live in NATO countries? About 600 million, correct? There are 146 million in Russia. Yes, we're the biggest nuclear power. But do you really think that we're about to conquer the Baltics using nuclear weapons? What is this madness? That's the first point, but by no means the main point.

The main point is something completely different. We have a very rich political experience, which consists of our being deeply convinced that you cannot do anything against the will of the people. Nothing against the will of the people can be done. And some of our partners don't appear to understand this. When they remember Crimea, they try not to notice the will of the people living in Crimea -- where 70 percent of them are ethnic Russians and the rest speak Russian as if it's their native language -- was to join Russia. They simply try not to see this.

In one place, Kosovo, you can use the will of the people, but not here. This is all a political game. So, to give reassurances, I can say the Russia has pursued and plans to pursue an absolutely peaceful foreign policy, directed toward cooperation.

As far as expanding our zone of influence is concerned: it took me nine hours to fly to Vladivostok from Moscow. This is a little less than from Moscow to New York, through all of Western Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Do you think we need to expand something?

The question is not at all about territory. And in terms of influence, yes, we would like Russia's influence to be more noticeable, more significant, but we are putting absolutely peaceful and positive content into this: economic influence, humanitarian influence, the influence derived from developing equal cooperation with our neighbors. And this is what our foreign policy is aimed at. And no one should doubt this.

MICKLETHWAIT: Just to use one example on the issue. You mentioned Crimea, you mentioned what happened then and back then in terms of the reassurances you might give is, back then, on March 4th 2014, we just checked -- three times our reporter asked you what is happening inside the Crimea, did you know anything about the Russian troops, which were taking over the Ukrainian government. And you said no, you knew nothing about that, nor the military bases. Then a year later you talked about directing the operation to bring Crimea home yourself. Do you accept that sometimes you could maybe have said things in a much clearer way when they are actually happening?

PUTIN: Of course, I have already commented on these things on many occasions. There is nothing simpler than that, I have already spoken about it. Yes, our servicemen guaranteed safe voting in the referendum. If we had not done this, then we would have been confronted with a worse tragedy than the burning alive of people in the Trade Union house in Odessa, when nationalists surrounded defenseless, unarmed people and burned them alive. This would have been widespread in Crimea. We didn't allow this to happen.

That people came themselves to the polling stations and voted is a fact. No one would have gone to the polling stations under the barrel of a gun. It's so obvious that you can't argue with it. Go to Crimea yourself now, take a walk and everything will become clear. And that's the end of the matter. So yes, our troops were in Crimea. We didn't even exceed the numbers of our units that were there in accordance with our agreements with Ukraine. But that's not the most important thing.

The most important thing is that the Crimean parliament voted for the referendum, and then for independence, and they were elected two years previously under Ukrainian law. In other words, this was an entirely legitimate body representing the people living in the Crimea. That's the first position. And the second is that the element of international law.

During the decision on Kosovo, a UN international court made a ruling, and all the western partners applauded this ruling. And the ruling was that decision of the central authorities of one or another state isn't needed when determining issues of independence. And that's that. So we acted entirely in accordance with international law, the United Nations charter and on the basis of democratic principles. And this, above all, is nothing more than an expression of the people's will.

MICKLETHWAIT: One last set of questions about your legacy or your current achievements. The future: Have you yet decided if you will run in the presidential elections of 2018?

PUTIN: We are now on the brink of parliamentary elections. We need to hold these elections, to see the results. But after that, there will be almost another two years. So it's far too early to speak about this. In the modern, rapidly changing world it's simply harmful to talk about this. We need to work, to make sure the plans and tasks we set ourselves are completed. We need to raise people's quality of life, develop the economy, the social sphere, and increase the country's defense capabilities. Depending on the resolutions to these tasks, we'll see how to organize the presidential election campaign in 2018 and who should take part. I haven't yet made a decision for myself.

MICKLETHWAIT: Do you think Russia is getting easier to run or harder?

PUTIN: Easier than when? Compared with Ivan the Terrible's time, Nicholas II's, Brezhnev's, Khrushchev's?

MICKLETHWAIT: In your time.

PUTIN: I think it's more complicated because, despite all the criticism of our western partners, our domestic democratic process is developing. Significantly more parties are going to take part in these elections than in previous years, and this will obviously leave its mark on the course and result of the campaign. There is a practical dimension. We now see that the rating of our leading political force -- the United Russia party -- slid a little. And many people are asking: What's up? What's going on? What's happened?

Clearly, it's the start of an active election campaign. And the large number of parties that are now taking part in the election process, they are all on the television screens, in the media and the papers. And what do they have to offer? They all criticize the authorities. They, meanwhile, don't say how to make things better and even say such things that even a person who has superficial understanding would find barely realistic and sometimes totally unfeasible. But then they look great on the television, they criticize and pour scorn on the representatives of the ruling party. But they don't say if they are ready to take responsibility for taking some not very popular but ultimately necessary decisions.

MICKLETHWAIT: Are you envious of the Chinese who don't have to go through these elections?

PUTIN: There is a different political system in China, and it's a different country. I don't think you'd like to see 1.5 billion people sense some sort of a disorder in their society and in their government. So let's give the Chinese the right and the possibility to decide how to organize their country and their society. Russia is a different country. We have different processes, a political system that's at a different level of development. It's a different quality - it's not about the level per se - it's about the quality of the political system. But it's developing and it's becoming more complex. In fact, that only makes me happy, and I'd like for the system to become stronger so that we have a balance in our political system that would allow it to be always in an effective state and aimed at development.

MICKLETHWAIT: Do you have an exit strategy? In 2018 you will have been the longest-serving president since the war. You will have been longer than, about the same as Brezhnev. Do you have an idea about how eventually you will leave power?

PUTIN: I can either participate in the elections or not. If I don't participate, then there will be another head of state elected, another president, and the citizens will decide how to cast their vote. In any case, and I want to draw your attention to this, in any case we already need to start thinking about how we -- and when I say ""we"" I mean myself, the members of my team, the government, the presidential administration -- how we see the future development of the country. Both the political and the economic processes - that's why we're already working on the economic development strategy and, most importantly, the economy after the year 2018.

And regardless of how the internal political process develops, I'm sure that we'll have to offer our vision to the country. The role of the future president, and the future government, is to agree or disagree with that vision, to adjust it, or to propose something completely different.

MICKLETHWAIT: You've just reorganized part of your government. You've promoted some people, some former bodyguards and people like that. Do you think that might be the sort of area where the next leader from Russia will come? Will it come from this younger generation of people who are beginning to emerge?

PUTIN: Yes, of course, I think the future leader has to be a fairly young person.

MICKLETHWAIT: A young man like Alexey Dyumin or someone like that?

PUTIN: But also a mature person. As for members of various special forces and the military - this is nothing new, this is not the first time that we have members of the Defense Ministry and the Federal Security Service being promoted to a regional administration. The Federal Guard Service shouldn't be an exception, why are they any worse?

The most important thing is that the right person wants to grow, is capable of growing and wants to serve the country in a line of work with wider powers and more responsibility. And if he wants it, and I can see that the person has potential, then why not let him work? And then after all representatives of regional governments will also have to participate in elections and let the region's citizens judge their proposals, get to know their programs, them personally. There must be a certain chemistry between the head of the region and the people who live there. The people must have a feel for what kind of person their potential future leader is, and if they vote for him, for me that means that they trust him.

MICKLETHWAIT: You just referred to the system surviving after you. People might say there were two ways in which Russia is very difficult to rule. One is it is a very personal system at the moment. Many people vote for you rather than for a party. And the other reason is Russian is still a fairly, you know, lawless place. You still have difficulties in Chechnya, you have things like murder of Boris Nemtsov which I know you've condemned and you have brought people in, but the people, whatever, mastermind is still being sought. Is Russia a very, very hard place to govern at the moment?

PUTIN: Any country is hard to govern, believe me. Do you think the U.S. is easy to govern? Is it easy to solve what would seem to be simple tasks, such as, say, Guantanamo? President Obama said in his first term that he would close Guantanamo, but it's still open. Doesn't he want to close it? Of course he does, I'm certain that he wants to. But a thousand things come up that don't let him completely settle the matter.

Speaking of which, that's actually bad, but that's another topic. Any country is hard to govern, even a very small country. It's not a question of whether the country is large or small. It's a question of how you relate to the work, to what extent you feel responsible for it.

Russia is also hard to govern. Russia is at the development stage of both its political system and the creation of a market-based economy. It's a complicated process, but very interesting. Russia, actually, is not just a large country, it's a great country. I mean its traditions, and its cultural particularities.

Yes, there are particularities and traditions in the political sphere. Why hide it? We all well know that we had an absolute monarchy, and then almost immediately the Communist period began. The base broadened a bit, but to a certain degree, the country's leadership became even harsher. It was only in the 1990s that we moved toward building a completely different system of domestic politics, a multiparty system, and that's also a difficult, ambiguous process.

You can't skip over steps of it. You need the public to get used to it, so that they felt their own responsibility when going to vote. So that they don't put their faith in populist decisions or reasoning, or one group of candidates that's just bashing another group. The public needs to carefully analyze what's being proposed by the candidates. That goes for elections to parliament, and it goes for presidential elections.

By the way, in places where it's a clear presidential system of government, people generally tend to vote not so much for the party as for the president's candidate. It's like that almost everywhere. So there's nothing unusual in this sense about our country's situation.

MICKLETHWAIT: Surely if you look at Chechnya and, say, the influence of someone like Ramzan Kadyrov. He has a very full rein, it does not seem as if he is brought under power much. That is completely different to what would happen, say in Mississippi or Tennessee. That is a different system, what is happening in Chechnya. Surely that is different. It is more lawless and it is more personal.

PUTIN: You know, that depends on how you look at it. We shouldn't forget what things were like there not long ago. People were bought and sold openly at markets, representatives of international terrorist organizations were in charge, including al-Qaeda. People were beheaded. Do you think we've forgotten all that? No.

The head of Chechnya now, Ramzan Kadyrov, was armed and fighting against federal forces in the so-called First Chechen War. That's a very complicated and big transformation. When his father, at first, the first president of Chechnya, and then he himself came to the conclusion that Chechnya's future was tied with Russia, they didn't do that under coercion. They did that based on their internal convictions.

I remember extremely well my first conversations with Ramzan Kadyrov's father, with the first president of Chechnya. He said to me directly - I was prime minister at the time in 1999 - he said that we see - we see - that the future of Chechnya can't be separated from Russia, otherwise we would fall under the way of other powers of the world, and there we'd be worse off.

But most important, and I'd also remember this very well, was that you didn't betray us. It was a very complicated situation then. The federal government wasn't acting consistently. It attacked, then retreated. It agreed with someone and then ripped up the agreements. The Chechen people needed a consistent, clear position from the federal authorities.

And don't forget the transformations that those people have undergone. We signed an agreement with Chechnya. That document is entirely in line with the constitution of the Russian Federation. We have a federal state, and the members of the federation are endowed with certain rights. As we see in Chechnya, for example, that doesn't destroy and it doesn't damage the country, but rather unites it.

Sure, probably there's a lot that still needs to be improved, a lot needs the difficult events of the mid-1990s to be finally forgotten, healed. That all takes time, and I'm certain that we will strengthen our domestic political structure and economy. I have absolutely no doubt about that. I think Russia has already turned the toughest pages in its history. We're only moving forward now, only get stronger.

MICKLETHWAIT: Can I ask you a personal thing? You've managed to rule Russia for 16 years. If you look at the chief executives and the business people who tune in to Bloomberg and watch it, very few of them last longer than 5 years-6 years, what advice would you give them to hang on to their jobs for longer?

PUTIN: As strange as this may sound, you shouldn't cling to it, you shouldn't try to remain in your position at any cost. After all I wasn't, as you said, here for 16 years. I was president of the Russian Federation for eight years, and then, not violating the constitution, not changing it for myself, I simply didn't run for a third term, which was impossible under the constitution.

Our constitution says: we can run for two consecutive terms. That's what I did. I was elected to two terms, and then I simply left for a different job. I worked for four years as the prime minister. According to the constitution I had the right again after four years, and I ran again for the presidency. And I was elected, and I'm working now. So it's not 16 years. It's four and four - eight, and now four. I've worked as president for 12 years.

MICKLETHWAIT: What is the reason for your success?

PUTIN: As for the length - one of the Canadian prime ministers, I think, was in power for 16 years. The German chancellor - how long has she been in power? If we're talking about the top job in the executive branch.

MICKLETHWAIT: Not 16 years. You have done longer than most.

PUTIN: And I haven't been for 16 years, I've been for 12. For her, I think, it's not less. And that's not the main thing. I don't know how there could be secrets here. I have always tried to sense the mood of the people, their needs, their attitude toward ways to solve problems, their priorities. That's mainly what I go by. And I think that's the most important thing in any person's work, in the work that the people of Russia entrusted in me.

MICKLETHWAIT: You look around the world at the moment and there are so many countries that have become dynasties - the Clintons, the Bushes in America. You have, as you say, on your southern fringe a lot of people. You have children whom you have very successfully kept out of the public eye. Would you ever want your daughters to go into politics? Would you want them to have the same life as you?

PUTIN: I don't think I have the right to wish something for them. They're young, but already adults, they should determine their futures themselves. On the whole, to the extent I see it, they've already made those choices. They're doing science and some other things that are absolutely noble and needed by people. They feel needed, they get joy from their work, and that makes me very happy. They are responsible and honest about the profession they have chosen for themselves.

MICKLETHWAIT: When I flew here on Korean Airlines I had a choice of two films to watch: one was Doctor Zhivago, and the other was the Godfather. Which would you recommend to somebody trying to understand Russia?

PUTIN: You know, we have a well-known phrase. ""Russia cannot be understood with the mind alone. No ordinary yardstick can span her greatness: She stands alone, unique. In Russia, one can only believe.""

Russian culture is multifaceted and diverse. So if you want to understand, to feel Russia, then of course you need to read books, Tolstoy and Chekhov and Gogol and others. Listen to music. Tchaikovsky. Watch our classical ballet.

But the most important thing is that you need to talk with people. Believe me, when you start to meet with ordinary people you understand that a Russian person, really any person from Russia, a Tatar, a Mordvin, a Chechen, a Dagestani, they are very open people, even a little naive. But there's one defining trait that probably all peoples have, although it comes out especially strongly in us. That's a drive toward fairness. It's one of the dominating, I think, traits in the mentality of a person from Russia, a Russian person. It is the drive toward something - and of course I'm speaking generally, we have millions of people, but on average.

We of course want to be materially well off, and I will try to do everything that I possibly can so that people live better, so that their quality of life improves. But despite all that, in the soul of a Russian person there is always a drive toward some kind of lofty moral ideal, lofty moral values. That definitely sets us apart, and I'm certain it's in a good way.

MICKLETHWAIT: That sounds like Doctor Zhivago to me. President Putin, thank you very much for talking to us. You've been very generous with your time. Thank you.

PUTIN: Thank you very much for your interest.

Flush with success in supporting his ally in Syria, Vladimir Putin has a new ambition: supporting another one, this time in Libya. The effort is beginning to undermine the UN-backed government there.

Russian President Putin's government is befriending a powerful military leader, Khalifa Haftar, who now controls more territory than any other faction in the tumultuous, oil-rich North African state. In two visits to Moscow in the past half-year, Haftar met the defense and foreign ministers, plus the national-security chief, to seek support. A top ally also visited last week and Russia is supplying funds and military expertise to Haftar's base in the east.

""The longer we wait, the more likely it becomes that Haftar wins,"" said Riccardo Fabiani, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at Eurasia Group in London. ""It's clear he's getting military, financial and diplomatic support.""

By backing Haftar in his standoff with the government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj in the west, Russia could bolster its role in the region and secure billions of dollars from Libya in arms and other contracts. At the same time, it also risks igniting more conflict in the divided country, where forces loyal to Haftar, as well as rival armed groups, are accused by the UN of human-rights abuses including torture and extra-judicial killings.

Other players also support Haftar, though he's opposed by powerful militias mostly across central and western Libya, where 70 percent of the population lives. Among his allies: the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, whose ex-army chief president, Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, has close ties to the Kremlin. Putin branded the NATO-led campaign that overthrew Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi as a ""crusade.""

Russia lost at least $4 billion in arms deals and billions of dollars more in energy and transport contracts after Qaddafi was ousted and killed, according to government and state-company officials.

Libya, 5 Years After Qaddafi, Still Caught in Chaos: QuickTake

The U.S. and the European Union support the UN-endorsed government in Libya. State Department spokesman John Kirby on Nov. 29 called on Haftar and his forces to submit to ""civilian command"" of the Tripoli authorities.

Putin's strategy could cement a new partnership with President-elect Donald Trump, should Moscow and Washington align in backing Haftar's self-proclaimed fight against radical Islamic groups, according to Mattia Toalda, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Trump has waxed enthusiastic about Egypt's El-Sisi and his proclaimed war on terror.

Haftar, 73, a one-time Qaddafi ally, received military training in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. He speaks good Russian, according to media reports in Moscow. He also lived for two decades in the U.S. after falling out with the Libyan leader, working with the CIA by keeping contact with anti-Qaddafi forces, according to Saudi-Arabia-owned Al Arabiya channel.

After returning from exile to fight with rebels during the revolution in 2011, Haftar set up his own power base. He announced a campaign to take control of most of the strategic city of Benghazi in 2014 and in September of this year seized most eastern oil installations.

""You have to work from reality -- the key here is military might and control of oil,"" said Rafael Enikeev, head of Middle East studies at a Kremlin advisory group run by a former Foreign Intelligence Service general. ""In such conditions, Haftar can dictate terms to Tripoli.""

Still, resistance to Haftar in the west of Libya is unlikely to crumble, raising the prospect of continued violence in the holder of Africa's largest oil reserves. Armed forces from the West backed by U.S. air strikes this month ousted Islamic State from its last major stronghold outside Syria and Iraq after a seven-month battle that Haftar's forces didn't participate in.

Russia has used its military intervention in Syria to bolster President Bashar al-Assad against rebels backed by the U.S. and its allies, and against terrorist groups. This month Russian-backed government forces wrested back full control of Aleppo, the former commercial capital, in a major reversal for the opposition in the almost six-year civil war.

While UN resolutions allow only the unity government to export oil and receive weapons, Russia has friendly ties with Egypt, which is likely sending arms to Haftar and his Libyan National Army, according to Oleg Bulaev, an expert from the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences. El-Sisi in May called for Haftar's military to be allowed to import weapons, the Egypt Daily News reported.

In addition, Russia printed 4 billion Libyan dinars ($2.8 billion) on contract for the Libyan central bank -- and transferred it to an eastern city that is loyal to the military chief. The money is being used across the country except for Tripoli and the western Misrata region, a hotbed of anti-Haftar sentiment.

In other ways too, Russia is helping Haftar's efforts to gain the upper hand over the Government of National Accord. Set up in December 2015, its influence doesn't extend much beyond the capital. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow said Dec. 2 in Rome after meeting his Italian counterpart that Haftar ""can and must become part of the national accords.""

A Haftar supporter, Ali El-Tekbali, a defense-committee member of the eastern-based assembly, said that if the stalemate continues, ""Russia's involvement will be inevitable and it will be in support of the legitimate Libyan army that will restore stability.""

That's not guaranteed to produce the outcome Putin may prefer, according to a report this month by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It noted: ""Russia's support for Khalifa Haftar in the name of countering terrorism could instead escalate Libya's conflict and undermine the UN-sponsored political process.""

So far, Haftar has allowed oil to flow from the fields and ports he controls and revenues go to the central bank in Tripoli. Wednesday, Libya reopened two of its largest oil fields in the west and began loading its first crude cargo in two years from those fields. But the country's economy has crumbled amid the continued political stalemate.

One possible outcome of the pressure: the Libyan prime minister could accept a deal in which Haftar would formally recognize Serraj's government in return for getting full command of Libyan armed forces and becoming de facto ruler of the country, said Karim Mezran, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.

That kind of ""militarization"" isn't the solution, said Ahmed Maiteeq, the deputy prime minister in Tripoli.

Russia's view is that people like Syria's Assad and Haftar are ""authoritarian leaders who are not liberal democrats and are unlikely to introduce democracy in their countries but they can bring order, and therefore we should support them,"" said Andrey Kortunov, director general of a foreign policy research group set up by the Kremlin.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Moscow', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Tripoli', 'Syria', 'Washington, D.C.', 'London', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Iraq', 'Benghazi', 'Rome']",Putin Wants to Install a New Strongman in Libya,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-21/putin-promotes-libyan-strongman-as-new-ally-after-syria-victory,None,

Army engineers defused three bombs hidden by Islamic State militants in Ibrahim Mohamed's home before letting him enter. One was concealed in his mother's favorite chair.

""I didn't take anything with me as I thought I'd only be gone for a day or two,"" the 39-year-old said as he wiped footprints from photographs discarded by jihadists who used his three-story house as a hideout during 18 months of fighting in Libya's Benghazi. ""It seems they experienced the same feeling during their last moments in my home.""

Mohamed's return was made possible by Libyan forces' biggest victory over Islamic State, an achievement welcomed by world leaders alarmed that the holder of Africa's largest oil reserves is becoming the latest stronghold of the militant group. Yet in a twist typical of the country's chaos, the success bolstered a general whose ambitions are an obstacle to United Nations efforts to forge a national unity government, highlighting the struggle to catch up with ground realities dictated by local strongmen.

""Khalifa Haftar's profile is rising,"" Mattia Toaldo, a Libya analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London, said of the general. ""He has a lot of control over everything that happens in Tobruk,"" he said, referring to the headquarters of Libya's eastern administration, which has repeatedly rejected a UN plan that could topple Haftar from his top security role. A rival government is based in Tripoli.

Shifting Priorities

Events in Benghazi, Libya's second city which shot to prominence in 2012 when U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was killed at the American consulate there, sum up the challenges Libya has posed since the revolution that removed Muammar Qaddafi with the help of a NATO bombing campaign spearheaded by France and Britain.

Two governments and dozens of allied militias have put control over the country's oil wealth and territory above reconciliation, leaving global powers with no effective partner to ease a crisis that allowed militancy to take root and fueled Europe's refugee crisis. As it's pushed back in Iraq and Syria, Islamic State has turned its attention to Libya, bringing a new set of priorities for commanders like Haftar.

Flushed by his recent success, the general is less likely to support the UN unity accord, which also calls for new leadership for the national military, a post he occupies, said Toaldo.

'Held Hostage'

Either Haftar's allies in Tobruk will ""manage to renegotiate the terms of the UN agreement in their favor or they will keep not voting, or voting on things that won't fly,"" he said. ""They'll keep buying time.""

Western powers have been hitting Islamic State in Libya, including a U.S. airstrike on Feb. 19 in Sabratha. Officials in Washington, Paris and Rome have denied reports of special forces deployments, and say they'll only step up operations when requested to by a unity government.

'Benghazi Will Remain'

The extremist group still controls coastal territory, and the destruction in Mohamed's neighborhood of al-Lithie is testament to how entrenched it had become. An airstrike had flattened one home, with others destroyed by gunfire. Last week, shipping containers filled with sand blocked the main road as newly returned residents embraced amid rubble. Women and children are barred until the streets are cleared of booby-traps.

Graffiti that read ""Islamic state will remain"" had been altered to ""Benghazi will remain."" According to a local saying, whoever controls the city, the cradle of the uprising against Qaddafi, controls Libya.

The head of the military's media office says the entire city will be free within days but that appears unlikely, with only three neighborhoods retaken.

Haftar defected from Qaddafi's army in the 1980s before heading into U.S. exile. He joined the February 2011 rebellion that ousted the dictator and three years later made his move for a larger role, attempting to rally the nation against Islamist gunmen and their political allies in Tripoli. He's had failures and successes, the most recent advance in Benghazi.

Rami al-Shihaibie, a security analyst in the city, warned that any unity administration that doesn't recognize de facto authority will fail.

""To reach a political settlement you need to share the power between those politicians who have a say over the foot soldiers on the ground,"" he said. ""Otherwise, you'll have an imaginary government.""

The problem for the UN is that few in Libya can agree on much. The two key administrations have feuded since mid-2014 when the Tripoli-based legislature, the General National Congress controlled by Islamists and revolutionaries, refused to hand power to the elected House of Representatives, which fled to Tobruk.

In the past week, lawmakers in Tobruk failed twice to hold scheduled votes of confidence in the UN proposal that appeared heading for success after talks in Tunis in January.

The ever-shifting dynamic of Libya's conflict is outpacing slow-moving diplomacy, said Zied Ragas, another political analyst in Benghazi. ""By the time we reach a deal for the current reality, we might have new parameters that require another agreement.""

Libya's UN-backed government is under mounting pressure to devalue its currency, joining other energy producers from Nigeria to Kazakhstan that have buckled in the face of tumbling revenue and domestic turmoil.

The dinar has been steadily weakening on the black market over the past year as the nation's political rifts thwarted a recovery in oil output. It hit a record low of 7 to the dollar this week, according to currency dealers in Tripoli. The official rate is 1.4.

The currency crisis is undermining Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's efforts to unite a country fractured by five years of conflict following the 2011 ouster of Muammar al-Qaddafi, leading instead to public discontent as prices surge. Libya is split between two rival administrations and militias vying for power in the holder of Africa's largest oil reserves.

Officials from the Tripoli-based central bank attended meetings along with other government members earlier this month in Rome. There they discussed a possible devaluation of the dinar and a removal or reduction of fuel subsidies, deputy minister of finance Abu Bakr al-Jafal said in an interview. Representatives of the central bank in eastern Libya also see a need for a devaluation to crush the black market, but say they must be involved in the decision.

""Devaluation is a must,"" said Ali Jihani, an official at the eastern regulator, based in al-Bayda. ""We might suggest making two exchange rates -- one for national imports, and another higher one for business importers and personal transfers."" But if officials in Tripoli attempt to impose a solution on the east, there ""will be consequences,"" Jihani said by phone without elaborating.

While the oil-price slump has battered all energy producers, OPEC's most vulnerable nations were dealt a double blow of sharply lower revenues and the increased risk of political turmoil. This includes Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela, a group dubbed the ""Fragile Five"" by RBC Capital Markets Ltd.

In Nigeria, a black market for foreign currency has boomed since the crash in oil prices strangled the inflow of dollars. The central bank has made several attempts to defend the naira after it plunged to a record in 2014, including a tightening of capital controls and restricting banks' ability to trade foreign-exchange, as well a currency peg that deterred foreign investment and worsened the shortage of dollars companies need to pay for imports.

With the World Bank estimating inflation will average about 20 percent this year in Libya, the Presidential Council on Monday allocated 300 million dinars to import food and distribute it at fairer prices.

Libyan officials have been forced to tap foreign reserves to keep the country running, and as revenues declined they also limited access to hard currency. That made both ordinary citizens and importers reliant on the black market, and as demand for dollars outstripped supply, the informal exchange rate climbed.

Ultimately, Libya needs to ramp up oil production to boost revenue and stabilize the currency. Output doubled to about 600,000 barrels per day since September when Khalifa Haftar, the general who holds sway over the nation's east, seized key ports and ended a blockade. the National Oil Corp. says it could rise to 900,000 barrels even without major investments to fix oil infrastructure. But that wouldn't generate the revenue needed to meet current spending and the production gains are fragile in the absence of a lasting political solution.

Authorities have discussed devaluation before. ""I'm surprised how the state is still reluctant to take these measures,"" said Ahmed Sanussi, a commentator on Libyan issues based in Amman. ""The delay means the continuation of the crises and the nonstop increase of black market prices,"" he said. Waiting means ""a bigger devaluation would be required in the future.""

Pushing through a credible economic program that curbs the dinar's collapse could lead to a surge in support for Serraj and his beleaguered government. If it tries and fails, Haftar could be the one who benefits.

In Tripoli, university employee Moftah Faraj said the country should be able to solve its economic crisis but the existence of rival governments, financial institutions and militia pose big hurdles. He said he worries about the consequences of devaluation.

""We have problems with liquidity, high living costs, a lack of medicine and health care,"" he said. Weakening the dinar ""will only create more problems for Libyan citizens as prices will rise.""

For a devaluation to work, officials will need to improve access to credit and hard currency, said Amr Farkash, a Libyan economic analyst. ""If there are no support measures, the devaluation will amount to a declaration by the central bank that it is struggling and might have to do it again.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Nigeria', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Kazakhstan', 'Iraq', 'Rome', 'Venezuela', 'Algeria', 'Amman']",Another Oil Producer Under Pressure to Devalue Its Currency,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-24/another-oil-producer-is-under-pressure-to-devalue-its-currency,None,
11400799,2016-06-12,"Last year's oil price rally ran out of steam in early May after 112 days. This year's has already lasted longer (140 days so far) and prices have risen further, but there are worries that, it, too, may be running ahead of market fundamentals. While prices seem unlikely to collapse again, there are good reasons to expect a pause in their upward march.

Crude prices have nearly doubled from the lows reached in mid-January. Brent rose above $50 a barrel last Monday and stayed there all week. West Texas Intermediate crude narrowly failed to do the same after breaking through the psychological barrier on Tuesday. Brent prices have risen an average 18 cents a day since mid-January, remarkably similar to the 19 cents a day early last year.

Sure, there's a real risk of structural supply shortages down the road, as oil companies have slashed spending on new projects, but they're not here yet. What we do have is a number of unforeseen disruptions, most recently in Canada and Nigeria, with a further deterioration in Libya, which have helped eliminate the surplus.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration saw disruptions removing more than 3.6 million barrels a day of potential supply in May, probably more than at any time since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Many stoppages have lasted years already and may last many more. Some output may never be fully recovered.

But some might return quite quickly. The biggest new disruption is already being resolved: the wildfire that swept through Alberta's oil sands and cut daily production by about 1.2 million barrels. Canadian production is returning slowly and will continue to add supply.

And while even the cheeriest optimist would hesitate to call an end to U.S. output declines, production there has just risen for the first time in three months on a week-by-week basis. Continental Resources has started fracking wells that it had drilled, but left uncompleted as prices collapsed. There were 4,290 such wells in the U.S. at the end of 2015 and others may follow Continental's lead, although Bloomberg Intelligence's Peter Pulikkan believes crude may need to rise another $5-$10 per barrel before that happens.

It's true that other lost supply is much less likely to return quickly. Nigerian output remains highly uncertain, with Shell indicating that workers' safety will remain a priority over repairing infrastructure and every day bringing reports of fresh attacks. ""There's clearly better organization and targeting,"" Shell's finance director Simon Henry said this week, comparing the latest attacks with those of 2009. Nevertheless, they remain focused on nearshore and onshore facilities, with deepwater platforms untouched so far.

Libya's political chaos also means there's little chance of output there recovering soon. It fell to 250,000 barrels a day on average in May, the lowest since February 2015, though it was reportedly back above 300,000 barrels by early June.

Yet despite the outages, the EIA still sees global inventories building through August. The resumption of Canadian supply, or any lasting evidence that U.S. output has stopped falling, could quickly tip bullish sentiment bearish again. Doubly so if there's any improvement in Nigeria or Libya. Crude's upward trajectory is still a fragile thing.

Authorities in eastern Libya pledged to export more crude oil soon, two days after shipping their first cargo in defiance of a national unity government based in Tripoli.

A representative of the National Oil Corp. based in eastern Libya said he expected payment within a month for the shipment. A separate branch of the company based in Tripoli, in the west of the divided country, said it hoped international forces would seize the ""illicit"" cargo. A United Nations official condemned the sale, while the buyer of the crude said it was legitimate.

Libya, with Africa's largest proven crude reserves, split into two separately governed regions in late 2014. The western region, centered around Tripoli, is home to the nation's official oil company, while the internationally recognized government is based in the east. Libyans are currently working with foreign support to set up a Government of National Accord that would represent both factions.

The tanker Distya Ameya loaded crude at eastern Libya's Hariga port on Monday. The NOC leadership in Tripoli, which is recognized by international traders such as Glencore Plc and Vitol Group as the country's official crude marketer, has repeatedly warned the NOC administration in the east against making its own shipments. The vessel carrying the cargo was stranded in the Mediterranean Sea east of Malta after the island state refused entry.

International Forces

""The ball is in the court of the international community,"" Mohamed Elharari, spokesman for the NOC in Tripoli, said by phone Wednesday. ""We are waiting for the coalition forces to return the cargo to Libya.""

In 2014, U.S. Navy SEALs seized a crude tanker that rebels tried to ship from central Libya. The ship was subsequently re-routed to a port under the control of the Tripoli authorities. Martin Kobler, head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, cited Wednesday in a Twitter post the UN Security Council Resolution 2278, which ""condemns attempts to illicitly export crude oil from Libya.""

The NOC based in eastern Libya expects payment within a month for the shipment of 650,000 barrels of crude, Chairman Nagi Elmagrabi said Wednesday by phone. The money will be deposited into an account at Bank Al Etihad in Jordan, he said, without disclosing the amount.

Legitimate Cargo

""We are planning to export more crude shipments in the near future,"" Elmagrabi said.

DSA Consultancy, which operates from Dubai and was identified by Elmagrabi as the buyer of the shipment, said the cargo was legitimate.

""DSA always work strictly within the local and international legal frameworks, as of today DSA is not in receipt of any legal basis for challenging the cargo's legitimacy,"" it said in an e-mailed response to questions.

Libya's oil production has fallen by 100,000 barrels a day due to a lack of port-storage capacity at Hariga, an Arabian Gulf Oil Co. official said Wednesday. The company, an NOC unit known as Agoco, reduced output to 130,000 barrels a day from 230,000 barrels, the official said, asking not to be identified because of company policy. A tanker moored now at Hariga has been blocked from loading a cargo of 1 million barrels, and Agoco may need to halt production in four days if the situation persists, the official said.

Armed Militias

Libya pumped about 1.6 million barrels a day of crude before the 2011 rebellion that ended Moammar Al Qaddafi's 42-year rule. It's now the smallest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping 330,000 barrels a day in March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Since Qaddafi's ouster and death, armed militias are also competing for control of the nation's oil facilities.

The NOC in eastern Libya has been trying for several months to export oil independently, Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa analyst with the Eurasia Group, said by phone from London. The eastern administration needs the revenue such sales can generate, but its main goal is to undermine the Government of National Accord, he said.

""No one is willing to accept that the eastern government is able to sell oil independently because it would have devastating consequences for Libya,"" Fabiani said. ""It would be much, much harder to form a national unity government in that case.""

The cargo refused by Malta was sold to DSA Consultancy FZC, a company based in the United Arab Emirates, according to Elmagrabi of the eastern NOC.

Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his French counterpart Jean-Marc Ayrault made an unannounced trip to Tripoli for talks with Libyan officials as Europe seeks to prevent a potentially overwhelming wave of refugees from the war-torn country.

Steinmeier and Ayrault plan to meet Libya's presidential council and Prime Minister Fayez el-Sarraj, who heads the United Nations-sponsored unity government, the German foreign ministry said in an e-mailed statement Saturday.

""The path to peace and stability in Libya comes via the implementation of the peace accord and the national unity government,"" Steinmeier said in the statement. ""We want to help people in Libya notice: political understanding comes with the chance to return to a normal life in security and peace.""

As Europe gets a grip on the biggest refugee wave since World War II through an agreement last month with Turkey to stem flows to Greece, politicians are shifting their focus to Libya. A fledgling unity government there is struggling to halt a collapse that has uprooted nearly half a million people and enabled Islamic State to establish a presence along the Mediterranean Sea.

European Union President Donald Tusk on April 13 warned about a possible overwhelming influx of refugees from Libya, saying that Italy and Malta may need EU support to cope. The number of refugees headed to Italy jumped to 9,676 in March from 3,828 in February, according to the United Nations.

A failure to adequately plan for the aid and governing of Libya after the U.S.-led NATO attacks in 2011 ""probably"" was his biggest error in office, President Barack Obama said in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Asked by host Chris Wallace about the ""worst mistake"" of his soon-to-end White House years, Obama listed the aftermath of the ouster and death of Moammar Qaddafi, even as he defended the intervention.

""Probably failing to plan for the day after,"" Obama said in the session, which was taped at the University of Chicago on April 7. He added that intervening in Libya ""was the right thing to do.""

The Libya operation and its chaotic aftermath has been resurrected in the 2016 presidential campaign. That's in part because of the increasing presence of the Islamic State there, and U.S. airstrikes to disrupt its operation.

Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, as Obama's secretary of state, strongly supported the intervention. In a 2011 interview with CBS News when still secretary, Clinton said of Qaddafi, ""We came. We saw. He died.""

'Deeply Regrettable'

At a March 7 town hall meeting, Clinton said what has happened since then ""is deeply regrettable. There have been forces coming from the outside, internal squabbles that have led to the instability that has given terrorist groups, including ISIS, a foothold in some parts of Libya.""

""I think it's fair to say, however, if there had not been"" an intervention ""we would be looking at something much more resembling Syria now, than what we faced in Libya,"" she said in March.

Army General David Rodriguez, head of U.S. Africa Command, told reporters last week that the Islamic State presence in Libya has doubled since 2015 to as many as 6,000 fighters.

Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Yahoo News in January that he thought Clinton's ""influence was pivotal in persuading the president to broaden the goal in Libya beyond just saving the people in Benghazi"" from Qaddafi's forces and ""essentially focusing more on regime change. The president told me that it was one of the closest decisions he'd ever made, sort of 51-49, and I'm not sure that he would've made that decision if Secretary Clinton hadn't supported it.""

'Political Transition'

The Congressional Research Service this month wrote that Libya's ""political transition has been disrupted by armed non-state groups and threatened by the indecision and infighting of interim leaders"" after the armed uprising toppled Qaddafi's regime.

""Interim authorities"" have ""proved unable to form a stable government, address pressing security issues, reshape the country's public finances, or create a viable framework for post-conflict justice and reconciliation,"" according to CRS, the public policy research arm of the U.S. Congress.

A United Nations-sponsored unity government led by Fayez Serraj assumed office last month and has won support from politicians and militias, offering hope that Libya may begin to emerge from the turmoil that has uprooted nearly half a million people since Qaddafi fell in 2011 after more than four decades in power.

Obama told Fox News that his best day in office was the one on which his signature health care plan was passed, and his worst was ""the day we traveled up to Newtown,"" after the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adult staff members at an elementary school in Sandy Hook, Connecticut.

11401017,2016-06-01,"In its 50-year history, the publicity-shy energy company hasn't seen an annual loss. Now business is becoming more competitive than ever.

It wasn't a normal business trip, even for Ian Taylor. Over an almost 40-year career in oil, the Oxford-educated Brit had set down in plenty of hot spots, from Tehran to Caracas, Baghdad to Lagos. Yet this journey -- destination Benghazi, Libya, in the midst of a civil war -- was different.

All Taylor had to do was peer out the window of the private plane he was in for a reminder. A thousand feet below, a NATO drone chaperoned the aircraft. Taylor, the compactly built chief executive officer of Vitol Group, the world's biggest independent oil trader, found himself wishing it were a proper fighter jet.

It was early 2011. Forces revolting against the 42-year dictatorship of Colonel Muammar Qaddafi had just taken control of the city and founded their own government. This meeting with the ragtag group of former military officials and local politicians had come together quickly, but if anybody could arrange something with them, Taylor figured, it was Vitol. A few weeks earlier, one of his top executives, Christopher Bake, had fielded a call from Doha. Qatar's oil minister, an intermediary explained, wanted to know if Vitol would be willing to supply fuel to the Qatari-backed Libyan rebels. Vitol had just four hours to reply.

Bake, based in Dubai, signaled Vitol's interest ""in about four minutes."" He then looped in his colleagues, most of them in London, to pull together a firm proposal. Vitol, he soon told the intermediary, was in. That they could move on a deal like this -- in a bloody war zone -- spoke volumes about the company's culture. As anybody in the oil business could attest, Vitol was a nimble and hungry opportunist, always ready to pounce.

Now, inside the plane, Taylor and Bake, who looks almost like a bodyguard thanks to his rugby-player frame, were en route to clinch the deal. But there was a catch: The rebels had no money. Vitol would have to be paid in crude. Western governments tacitly approved the arrangement, although aside from the lone drone, there wasn't any official support. If something went wrong, Taylor and his company were on their own.

The two men braced themselves as the plane banked hard. The risk of anti-aircraft fire from Qaddafi forces made a conventional landing impossible, so the pilot descended rapidly in a series of stomach-churning turns. Once on the ground, Taylor and Bake made their way to the designated meeting point.

Back then, the center of Benghazi, a tired collection of dusty 1970s buildings around a fetid lagoon, was a far more dangerous place than the one portrayed in this year's Hollywood film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, about the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens in September?2012. In the early days of the civil war, Benghazi was a city where nearly every man -- and often even children -- carried a Kalashnikov, and the rest of the population lived under the constant threat that Qaddafi troops could breach the city's defenses.

After some discussion, Vitol accepted the deal. Things went awry within days. Despite promising to keep it secret, the rebels announced they'd made an arrangement to sell oil. In response, Qaddafi's forces immediately blew up a key pipeline. Without oil, Vitol couldn't be paid.

Still, the company upheld its end of the bargain. Over the coming months, its tankers shipped cargo after cargo of gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil into eastern Libya. ""The fuel from Vitol was very important for the military,"" Abdeljalil Mayuf, an official at rebel-controlled Arabian Gulf Oil in Benghazi, later said.

In the end, the rebels brought down Qaddafi, and once the fighting subsided, Vitol got its oil. At one point, as everyone waited for production to restart, the amount owed by the rebel government ballooned to more than $1 billion.

Five years later, Taylor, now 60, recalls the Benghazi affair over breakfast at London's St. Pancras station ahead of the 9:18 a.m. Eurostar to Paris. ""It was a deal which, to be honest, got much larger than it should have,"" he says.

The boldness of the Benghazi deal epitomizes the world of Vitol -- a high-stakes mix of business and energy geopolitics conducted in some of the most difficult corners of the world. The closely held company, which last year made a net profit of $1.6 billion, is a hidden giant of the global economy, handling more than 6 million barrels a day, enough to meet the combined daily needs of Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.

Over half a century (the company will celebrate its 50th anniversary in August) Vitol has never suffered an annual loss. Profits surged from just $22.9 million in 1995 to a record $2.28 billion in 2009, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg Markets. At its peak, Vitol's return on equity, a measure of profitability compared with the money that partners have invested, was a geyserlike 56 percent. Even Wall Street pales in comparison; Goldman Sachs's best ROE since going public in 1999 is 31 percent. ""Vitol has established itself as the ultimate energy trader,"" says Jean-François Lambert, who as former global head of commodity and structured trade finance at HSBC dealt extensively with the company.

This is the story of how Vitol got there and how at times it stumbled along the way -- reconstructed by Bloomberg Markets through two dozen interviews with current and former executives and others in the industry, and reviewing hundreds of pages of previously unreported financial and legal records filed in the Netherlands, the U.S., and Luxembourg.

Vitol, which trades about 6.5 percent of the world's oil, fights in a tough arena. It competes with other independents such as Glencore, Trafigura Group, Mercuria Energy Group, Gunvor Group, and Castleton Commodities International. It also grapples for market share against Big Oil's in-house trading arms, including those of BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, and, increasingly, state-owned Chinese oil companies.

As for the future, Vitol faces a daunting fact: The best days of oil trading are almost undoubtedly in the rearview mirror. Margins are shrinking as the market becomes ever more transparent and competitors emerge fighting for the same barrels. Even as Vitol sinks more capital into assets such as refineries and terminals, returns are falling. Last year's ROE was 16 percent -- for Vitol, a less-than-stellar number.

Taylor became an oil trader by chance. Of Scottish descent, raised and educated in England, he went to work at Shell for a simple reason: It paid better than other jobs he was considering. Starting in 1978 he learned the oil-trading ropes through stints in Singapore and Caracas, where he met his wife.

Vitol has grown like a Silicon Valley startup under Taylor, who came on in 1985 and took the top job a decade later, transforming the company into one of the world's top traders as oil demand surged in China and other emerging markets. During his time as CEO, Vitol has increased its equity value by 3,500 percent, from $278 million in 1996 to almost $10 billion last year. Over the same period, Glencore went from $1.2 billion to $35 billion, a smaller though still impressive 2,800 percent rise.

Vitol was born amid more modest ambitions. In August?1966, two Dutchmen, Henk Viëtor and Jacques Detiger, invested 10,000 Dutch guilders (about $2,800 at the time) to start a Rotterdam company with the aim of buying and selling refined petroleum products by barge up and down the Rhine. They crunched Viëtor and ""oil"" to get Vitol. The money was a loan from Vietor's father and the pair agreed to pay an annual interest rate of 8 percent. Detinger, now 81 years old, remembers that Vietor's father told him: ""You have 6 months -- if it doesn't work, you're out.""

The company's first accounts showed a small profit and a balance sheet of 200,000 guilders including the value of the owners' two cars. The business grew as the competition -- major producers that controlled long-term contracts -- began breaking apart in the late 1960s and '70s. Small traders, including Vitol, started buying and selling oil on the nascent spot market.

""It was tricky,"" Detinger says in an interview in London. He's sitting alongside Taylor -- recalling some ""very dangerous"" moments, such as the first oil crisis in 1973-74, when the price of refined products fluctuated wildly.

Back then, the energy market had yet to develop any futures, options or swaps contracts to hedge price risks, so traders like Vitol were facing a massive exposure every time they bought a cargo: If the market moved against them, they could loss everything.

As business grew, Vitol expanded geographically, opening offices from Switzerland to London to New?York. Tension followed, with the founders split on strategy. In 1976, Viëtor, then CEO, left, and Detiger took over. By the time Taylor joined to run the crude oil side of the business, Vitol was handling about 450,000 barrels a day -- a decent figure but only half what the industry's leaders did. The kings of the oil trading game back then were Phibro, which had just bought Salomon Brothers, the investment bank, for $550 million; Marc Rich + Co., founded by the eponymous trader and onetime tax fugitive; and Transworld Oil, controlled by John Deuss, who'd risen to prominence and infamy by doing business with South Africa in the days of apartheid.

The modern Vitol began to take shape in 1990, when Detiger and seven other partners sold the company for $100 million to $200 million (the actual figure wasn't disclosed) to a group of about 40?employees, including Taylor. The management buyout was financed by what was then ABN, the Dutch bank, and trader Ton Vonk took over as CEO.

Since that time, no single shareholder has controlled more than 5 percent, creating what Taylor and others describe as a ""we"" culture that's the cornerstone of Vitol's success. ""If anyone thinks they are bigger or better than the sum of the entity,"" says Bake, ""he tends to get indirectly smacked down.""

Vonk pushed Vitol into crude trading, expanding beyond refined products, and started signing so-called processing deals with refiners, supplying crude and receiving fuels. Those agreements led to what would be the most profitable deal ever for Vitol -- and one that also almost brought the company down.

In the early 1990s, Vitol was processing crude at a seemingly cursed refinery in a town called Come by Chance on the eastern edge of Canada. When a fire tipped the refinery into bankruptcy, Vitol bought it for $300 million in 1995, then booked a $1 billion profit when it sold the plant a decade later. It remains the company's best-ever return from a single deal.

What's little known is that Vitol almost went belly-up as it struggled under the cost of upgrading the Come by Chance refinery just as its trading business floundered. In 1997 net profit fell to just $6.6 million, far below the consistent earnings ranging from $60 million to $70 million it achieved in 1992, 1993, and 1994 before it bought Come by Chance. As an investment, the refinery ""was too big"" relative to the company's size, says Kho Hui Meng, head of Vitol in Asia.

The experience continues to resonate. In the wake of Come by Chance, Vitol became fanatically conservative and overcapitalized. (Rating companies S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings privately give Vitol an investment-grade BBB rating, according to a presentation reviewed by Bloomberg Markets.) Since then, Vitol has sought out partners, including an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, when buying assets. Today it co-owns five refineries with a capacity of 390,000 barrels per day. But Kho says Vitol never forgets its key strength. ""Our core business is trading, moving oil from A to B efficiently,"" he says.

On a sunny April morning in Rotterdam, Jack de Moel oversees the bread and butter of Vitol's business. The company owns the massive Euro Tank Terminal here, which De Moel manages, and the barges Noorozee and Citrine are taking on fuel oil from tank 404, which rises taller than a 10-story building. A few meters away, a big tanker, the 144-meter-long (472-foot) Blue Emerald, is also loading fuel ahead of a North Sea crossing. Its ultimate destination is the Thames Estuary in England.

The terminal loaded 3,900 barges and tankers last year -- one every two and a half hours. Each of those ships represents a potential profit, albeit a relatively small one. As the round-the-clock work here shows, oil trading is a business of big volumes but razor-thin margins. It also requires a huge investment. Since 2006, Vitol has built 28 towering storage tanks alongside Rotterdam's deep-water Calandkanaal. They can hold enough fuel to fill up 22 million Volkswagen Golfs.

Vitol's financial health isn't linked to oil prices the way Big Oil's fortunes are. ""We are long volatility,"" says Paul Greenslade, who was Vitol's head of trading until he retired in 2014. That's industry jargon meaning Vitol benefits from price fluctuations, regardless of market prices. In 2009, for instance, the year the company reported its best profit, oil plunged to $30 a barrel from a record $150. Last year, as most of the energy industry struggled amid cascading oil prices, Vitol reported its fourth-highest?profit.

For Vitol, oil is just a starting point. It blends different fuels to create the exact grade needed for each region, customer, and even season. To ensure supply, Vitol will provide cash upfront to companies such as Russia's Rosneft or governments like the one that runs oil-rich Kurdistan in northern Iraq -- more than recouping its money when it sells the oil.

""The perception of them is as speculators,"" says Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston. But, in reality, he says, Vitol is an intermediary between consumers and producers. It will turn supertankers into floating storage farms, timing sales to beat roller-coastering prices. In 2015 it hired one of the world's largest tankers -- a 380-meter vessel as long as the Empire State Building is tall -- to store crude. On any given day, Vitol has about 200 ships at sea. Last year the company logged 6,629 ship voyages.

For the most part, Vitol is a passenger riding the oil market. Sometimes the market severely restricts profit-making; this was the case in 2012, 2013, and the late 1990s. At other times, the market provides opportunities, often unexpectedly. The war in Libya was one such case; the 2011 nuclear crisis in Fukushima was another, leading to a massive shift in energy flows to Japan. ""Opportunity is defined externally,"" says Russell Hardy, a senior Vitol executive. The job of the company's traders, he says, is to find ways to profit from those opportunities.

Vitol's opportunity-driven culture has forged a fiercely loyal staff. It can't hurt that many have become fabulously wealthy. They keep a notoriously low profile, and little is known about their individual wealth. However, a messy divorce proceeding a decade ago involving one of the company's most senior traders offers a rare glimpse into Vitol's riches.

According to documents filed in Texas' 14th Court of Appeals, Mike Loya, who heads the company in the Americas out of Houston, controlled Vitol shares valued at $140 million at the end of 2007. Since then, Vitol's book value has almost doubled, with profits and payouts surging, suggesting that top executives are each worth hundreds of millions. Loya says that what lured him to move from his old job at Transworld in the 1990s was a chance to earn a stake in a dynamic business. ""If you do well, you become one of the owners,"" he says.

In 2014 alone, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg Markets, Vitol distributed a special dividend-like payment of more than $1.1 billion to its 350 or so employee shareholder-partners. From 2008 to 2014, these shareholders were awarded payouts totaling almost $5.6 billion. Even so, says Chief Financial Officer Jeff Dellapina, ""over the past 10?years we've reinvested 50 percent of the profits in the business -- an appropriate level for an established and growing company.""

Vitol is a private company in more ways than one, and it's never found the oxygen of publicity to be particularly inviting. ""When Vitol makes headlines, they are bad headlines,"" says Oliver Classen of the Berne Declaration, a Swiss nongovernmental organization that has researched commodity trading and advocates formal regulation of the industry.

In 1995, for instance, Vitol paid a Serbian warlord $1 million for help resolving a business dispute. Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as ""Arkan,"" was indicted in 1997 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague for crimes against humanity. He was assassinated in 2000 before his trial could go to court.

Vitol took its most damaging reputational hit in 2007 over paying the regime of Saddam Hussein about $13 million in ""surcharges"" to secure oil shipments under the United Nation's scandal-plagued Oil-for-Food Programme. The investigation, led by Paul Volcker, the former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, exposed a world of illicit payments, secret bank accounts, and diplomats for hire. Rather than paying a fine without admitting wrongdoing, Vitol agreed to plead guilty in the Supreme Court of the State of New York; other companies, including Chevron, resolved similar civil and criminal cases at the time, but only a few pleaded guilty. ""We did a settlement to protect our own staff,"" Taylor says, suggesting that without the deal, U.S. prosecutors could have charged individual traders. He points out that there were plenty of others paying the same surcharges. ""It was chaos,"" Taylor says of the UN program.

Vitol's reputation was rattled again in 2012 after the company purchased Iranian fuel oil, skirting U.S. and European Union sanctions. Vitol, which used its Bahrain subsidiary for the deal, denied wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the episode marked a watershed for the company. Scarred by bad publicity and the negative reaction of some of its banks, Vitol tightened its internal compliance standards. Other changes soon followed. The company, for example, scaled back much of its trading activity in Nigeria as corruption allegations piled up against officials under then-President Goodluck Jonathan.

Even so, Vitol lags in disclosing information that activists such as the Berne Declaration consider imperative. While Glencore and Trafigura have joined a voluntary scheme to improve transparency in the commodity sector, Vitol has resisted. Unlike other privately owned traders, including Cargill, it refuses to disclose its financial results.

Taxes are another rallying point for critics. In 2015, judging from calculations based on the company's accounts, Vitol paid an effective global tax rate of 14.1 percent, less than half of Goldman's 30.7 percent. Although Vitol is incorporated in Rotterdam, the partner-owners control it through two Luxembourg-based shell companies, Vitol Holding II and the Tinsel Group, according to information disclosed in the Loya divorce papers. It settles a large chunk of its trades in tax-friendly jurisdictions, including Switzerland and Singapore, longtime hubs for commodity traders. ""Our main trading offices were established a long time ago in key trading centers,"" says Dellapina.

Although Vitol isn't the only company that tries to reduce its tax bill, it's been particularly successful at it. In 2013 it paid no tax at all -- thanks to the use of tax credits -- in a year when its net income was $837 million.

Even though the CEO and most top executives are based at the company's sleek, minimalist offices near Buckingham Palace, Vitol pays the bulk of its corporate taxes outside Britain. Criticism of Vitol's tax practices -- from the Scottish National Party and others -- has been exacerbated by Taylor's donations of more than $2 million to U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party and to causes supported by him. ""Vitol has an open and transparent relationship with the tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which it operates and pays its corporate taxes in each of these jurisdictions,"" Dellapina says.

Having thrived for more than two decades, Vitol may need to prepare for choppier seas. Trading margins keep shrinking as the minute-by-minute movements of the global oil industry are disseminated on the internet. Possession of market information that others don't have -- once Vitol's edge -- is fast disappearing. So what will Vitol do?

As quick-witted as he usually is, Taylor struggles a bit to answer the question over his breakfast at St.?Pancras. ""You will be surprised,"" he finally says. ""I don't know the answer.""

After mulling things over, he says Vitol will benefit from ""natural market growth."" He also says he wants to buy more assets to complete the creation of what in the oil industry is known as ""a system"" -- a cache of oilfield stakes, refineries, tanks, and petrol stations spanning the cycle from the ground to the gas tank -- just like Big Oil. It would be Vitol's own brand of vertical integration, he says, featuring minimal investment or exposure to actual oil production. ""I will kill -- kill! -- to have that system,"" he says.

Although building such a structure wouldn't come cheap, Taylor, along with his colleagues, is determined to stay private. Glencore's 2011 initial public offering, which created several paper billionaires overnight, doesn't tempt Taylor or his team, he says.

At least that's the case now. Bob Finch, a former Vitol senior executive and for years the largest shareholder, says Vitol considered the idea of hiring a bank to explore going public about 10?years ago. Unbeknown to those outside Vitol's inner sanctum, the IPO option reached the executive committee, where it was defeated by what Finch says was a ""narrow vote."" Taylor says the idea of hiring a bank was ""rejected by most members"" of the executive committee.

Over the course of Vitol's history, a number of companies expressed an interest in buying the oil trader. At one point, Vitol talked about selling a stake to Petronas, the state-controlled Malaysian oil company with which Taylor had developed a close relationship during his time in Singapore. It didn't happen. Perhaps the most serious conversation happened in the late 1990s when Enron considered buying the oil trader. The partners turned down the offer, thereby staving off a disaster: Enron, which went bankrupt in 2001 amid an accounting scandal and criminal investigations, was offering to pay with its own shares, which later turned out to be worthless.

The biggest challenge for Vitol may be internal as it wrestles with succession. Transitions at other trading houses show they're anything but easy. Taylor, who recently battled throat cancer that's in remission, says he isn't going anywhere soon. But he and at least three other members of the nine-member executive committee are either past or near 60. His lieutenants -- including David Fransen, who heads the office in Geneva, Loya in Houston, and Kho, the boss in Singapore -- will at some point retire. Vitol has been grooming the next generation -- including Hardy, Dellapina, Bake, and Mark Couling, head of crude trading -- to take the baton. One of these men, all in their 40s or 50s, is expected to be the next CEO.

Until then, Taylor says he's adhering to his usual schedule, which means traveling for almost half the year. The commodities business is still ruled by the centuries-old pledge of ""my word is my bond."" Face-to-face meetings are imperative.

""You need to have relationships,"" he says. Which is the reason Taylor flew into Benghazi -- a deal he didn't want to do ""unless I knew who I was dealing with,"" he says. ""It could have gone very, very badly wrong.""

And with that he's off to catch the Eurostar -- in search of the next deal.

France is no longer France, Donald Trump said provocatively after the nation came under repeated terrorist attack. Now a new report casts the country as riskier for disrupting businesses than many developing nations with a history of violence and upheaval.

London-based risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft has put together a Civil Unrest Index that ranks almost 200 countries in terms of their exposure to protests, mass demonstrations, ethnic or religious violence. France ranks 16th, just behind Argentina and barely in front of Afghanistan and Mali, a former colony. It is the only European country in the top 20 and considered ""high risk."" Greece, which almost got the boot from the euro, came in 25th. Germany and the U.K. are still considered ""low risk.""

""It is notable that civil unrest does not just occur in the 'usual suspects' of high risk political violence countries,"" such as Syria, Yemen and Libya, the report specifies. Several of them -- India, Mexico, South Africa, France, Brazil -- have weathered significant protests on a weekly basis in the past 12 months and ''companies operating in key G-20 countries must deal with an increasingly complex set of risks in relation to political violence,'' it said.

To be sure, places like Afghanistan and Somalia are far more dangerous environments for businesses to enter. But in France, the value of the infrastructure coming under attack is so much higher. That means there is more at stake with more frequent and more violent civil disorder. Last year, Air France workers ripped the shirts off the backs of executives after the airline slashed jobs.

So what's the science behind this index? The results are compiled from a survey that assigned scores and importance to a range of different factors. How frequent is unrest? What's been the impact in the past, from damage to property to actual deaths? What instruments are used to tackle discontent? What are the underlying economic conditions, from cost of living to inflation? Are government subsidies on fuel and food being cut? These factors are considered drivers to civil disruption.

The report draws a key distinction between France and Germany: ""While France has an active civil society and trade unions, these actors tend to encourage demonstrations, as protest and industrial action are key facets of the country's political culture. In contrast, Germany's more consensual political culture supports close cooperation between trade unions, industry and government.""

In light of Brexit, the report says U.K. should be more vigilant.

""The implications of the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU increase the potential for unrest in the country,"" the report says. ""The possibility of price rises for imported goods, combined with a slowdown in economic activity is likely to serve as a key source of popular discontent.""

11401045,2016-04-14,"If international confrontations over Ukraine and Syria have dominated Vladimir Putin's third term in the Kremlin, the president focused far more on domestic issues in his latest annual call-in show as parliamentary elections approach.

With Russia enduring its longest economic downturn of his 16-year rule, Putin the micromanager took center stage Thursday to chastise officials over unpaid wages and dilapidated roads, and even pronounce on the size of labeling for products containing palm oil. He assured Russians the economy will resume growth next year and offered understanding for those struggling with soaring food bills, even as he explained that a government ban on imports of foreign foodstuffs was partly responsible for higher prices.

""Putin this year was very focused on domestic issues,"" Nikolai Petrov, a professor at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, said by phone. ""There's a major electoral campaign and people are far more interested in what is happening at home than abroad.""

State television said that social issues and the economy dominated the more than 3 million questions submitted for Putin's 14th live call-in show, a Kremlin-controlled exercise that lasted three hours and 40 minutes. Russians enjoyed rising prosperity during Putin's first two presidential terms from 2000, when the economy of the world's largest energy exporter grew at an annual average of 7 percent. The number who fell into poverty in 2015 rose by 3.1 million to 19.2 million, the most since 2006, as wages fell and the ruble tumbled following the collapse in oil prices.

Elections, Economy

Parliamentary elections in September present Putin with his biggest test since he returned to the Kremlin in 2012 after unprecedented protests against him. While his personal ratings remain above 80 percent, the government and regional authorities are becoming targets of popular discontent.

The difficult situation ""hasn't been resolved yet but the trend is positive,"" Putin said, pointing to forecasts that the economy will contract by 0.3 percent this year and expand by 1.4 percent in 2017. ""We have grounds for optimism.""

Despite the almost 50 percent plunge in oil prices, Russia is rebuilding its international reserves, which now total more than $387 billion, he said. Unemployment remains low, the Russian leader added.

The central bank sees the economy contracting by as much as 1.5 percent in 2016 and it won't grow faster than 2 percent a year after that without economic reforms, even if oil prices recover to $100 a barrel from around $45 currently, central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said Tuesday.

Rapid Results

Putin's domestic engagement produced some speedy results on air. Shortly after he criticized officials when workers at a fish-products plant complained about unpaid wages and poor conditions, one of the show's hosts announced that a criminal case had been opened into the factory. After a woman in the city of Omsk condemned potholes in the roads, a local official pledged that 21 roads would be repaired by May 1.

Even as Putin was promising businesses more relief from official audits and checks, however, law enforcement were carrying out searches at the Moscow offices of IKEA and at billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov's Onexim company. IKEA said the probe related to a local firm seeking to seize land where its Moscow office is located, while the independent Dozhd TV reported that the raid on Onexim was an attempt to pressure Prokhorov into selling his RBC media holding.

Food Prices

People chosen for the studio audience that's also part of Putin's broadcast were given instructions and training after being gathered at a hotel outside of Moscow since Tuesday, Prokhorov's RBC daily reported Thursday, citing people close to the organizers. Questions were screened and dozens of people selected to pose them to the president from among hundreds of participants, it said.

Putin said sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and the EU over the Ukrainian conflict are unlikely to be repealed ""for the foreseeable future."" He defended Russian countermeasures banning some food imports, saying they created ""conditions for the development of our agriculture,"" after Lyudmila Safronova from Moscow complained that rising prices had doubled the cost of her weekly family food basket to 10,000 rubles ($150) this year.

Putin, who in recent years rallied sentiment against the U.S. and Europe amid the worst stand-off since the Cold War over Ukraine, offered warm words for President Barack Obama, calling him a ""decent man"" and a ""strong person"" for his admission that he'd mishandled Libya. Russia needs a ""stable, prosperous Ukraine,"" and has kept to its word over the Minsk peace accords to resolve the conflict, Putin said.

Putin even eschewed a chance to bang the patriotic drum when asked by Alina, a first grader, in a video question whether a woman can become president because ""papa says only Putin can deal with that America.""

Russians ""shouldn't be thinking about how to overcome America,"" he replied. ""We should be thinking about dealing with domestic problems such as roads and making sure the economy will grow. Then we won't need to overcome anyone because we will feel invulnerable.""

11401046,2016-03-15,"Militants range stretches from Mali desert to Ivorian beach

Militants linked to al-Qaeda are broadening attacks across West Africa from their base in the desert to the coast. Their goal is to present themselves as the champions of resistance to France's military in the region and prevent Islamic State's expansion.

Two groups -- al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Mourabitoune -- have claimed joint responsibility for assaults in Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast that killed more than 65 people, many of them foreigners, since November. The weekend attack on a seaside town in Ivory Coast was the first strike hundreds of miles from the Sahel, an arid region below the Sahara where French soldiers have been fighting militants since 2013.

The French presence in former colonies from Mali to Niger to Ivory Coast is being used by al-Qaeda as a justification for its high-profile assaults on West African cities. The two groups recently reunited to compete with Islamic State, which has bases to the north in Libya and is trying to recruit fighters and expand in the Sahel, according to Mathieu Guidere, an analyst of Islamist groups in West and North Africa at the University of Toulouse II.

""Al-Qaeda has changed strategy and is competing with Islamic State in the region,"" Guidere said by phone. ""They are presenting their actions as resistance to the new colonialist movement of France in Africa. There is a consistency in their attacks and this means that their fighters no longer want to leave for IS in Libya.""

France has deployed 3,000 soldiers in the Sahel following the seizure of northern Mali by Islamist rebels in 2012. Even after French fighter jets pushed them back, militants kept bases near desert towns like Kidal and regularly carry out hit-and-run attacks on United Nations peacekeeping troops. The UN says its mission in Mali has suffered the highest death toll of any of its operations globally.

Kidal is about 2,200 kilometers (1,367) miles from Grand Bassam, the site of this weekend's attacks. That's about the distance from Paris to Kiev.

Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer of cocoa, had been on high alert since November, when gunmen stormed into a luxury hotel in Mali's capital, Bamako, killing more than 20 people. Authorities thwarted several militant plots before Sunday's assault, Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko said Monday.

Even with increased security, it will be extremely difficult to prevent future attacks, said Bjorn Dahlin van Wees, an Africa analyst at the Economist Intelligence unit.

Core Areas

""The Ivory Coast attack was new in the sense that it was so far away from the core areas of these groups,"" he said. ""There's certainly a risk of more attacks: they use simple weaponry, the borders are porous. Cities with a large western or French presence are the main targets.""

Analysts agree that Senegal may be targeted next. Senegal, formerly the seat of the French colonial administration in Africa, has beaches that attract thousands of European tourists, as well as the biggest population of French citizens in West Africa, with 20,000 residents. The predominantly Muslim country has so far been spared militant violence.

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb surfaced in the early 2000s as an offshoot from an Algerian militant group and gained notoriety through kidnappings of tourists in West Africa. It was based in desolate areas for years and appeared mainly interested in collecting ransom and smuggling in the Sahel, according to the Brussels-based International Crisis Group.

Easily Spread

Today's anti-western rhetoric from al-Qaeda sympathizers is spread easily across social media, and sending more troops to patrol the region isn't going to be effective, Guidere said.

""The combination of their expanding ideology and the anti-colonialist trend within the population makes it very difficult to stop militants from making these kinds of attacks,"" he said. ""You need a strategy to counter radicalization, an awareness campaign to explain to people why the French are there.""

11401048,2016-01-07,"European governments showed little inclination to open a new front in the war against Islamic State after a terrorist attack rocked Libya, bringing the extremist advance closer to Europe's shores.

France and Britain, which spearheaded the NATO campaign that ousted Libya's Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 and are currently bombing Islamic State redoubts in Syria and Iraq, said the priority is to get a functioning government in Libya.

European leaders are tentatively planning to send peacekeeping troops to back up the future government, the product of a power-sharing arrangement struck in December between two delegates of rival regimes on opposite sides of the oil-rich state. It is meant to be up and running within a week or two.

""The most likely scenario is that it will be a Libyan government which will intervene with the help of a foreign coalition,"" said Arturo Varvelli, an analyst at the Milan-based Institute for the Study of International Politics. ""No one wants to put boots on the ground, so any foreign coalition will be limited to small units for training and some special forces, there is too much anarchy out there.""

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization air war provided a lesson in what can go wrong. It exposed Europe's military limitations and political fault lines -- Germany sat it out -- and turned Libya from a dictatorial state into an ungoverned one.

Sea Patrols

European navies are patrolling the central Mediterranean Sea to intercept human traffickers operating out of Libya, but have been unwilling to intervene on Libyan soil in the absence of a viable government.

The urgency of implementing last month's settlement was highlighted by Thursday's explosion at a police training center in the western city of Zliten that killed at least 50 recruits, the deadliest terrorist attack ever in the nation. While no one claimed responsibility, speculation focused on Islamic State's Libyan branch, which shelled the country's largest oil port earlier this week.

European officials renewed appeals for a joint administration, with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier saying ""how important and urgent it is for all Libyans to join forces against the cancer of terror.""

Tunisia Talks

European support for the nascent government is on the agenda Friday when EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini meets Libyan Presidency Council members in Tunisia.

France, which attempted to rally a military alliance after November's terrorist attacks in what President Francois Hollande called a ""war"" on Islamic State, dispatched the nuclear-propelled Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean as the launchpad for strikes on the group's headquarters in Syria. On its way there, the carrier conducted reconnaissance flights over Libya.

France too placed the emphasis on ""all the Libyan parties to rapidly form a government of national unity which will be the partner of the international community against terrorism,"" Romain Nadal, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in an e-mail.

Italian Colonial Power

Italy's proximity to Libya, coupled with its status as Libya's former colonial power, puts Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government on the front line of Europe's response to developments just a few hundred kilometers across the Mediterranean. Italian oil producer Eni SpA is the biggest investor in Libya.

Renzi said last month it was ""crucial that Libya be considered the pivot of policy in the Mediterranean, and if there is one country in which Italy will play a significant role, that can only be Libya.""

For all the talk of Italy leading a military coalition, Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the first response to the terrorist threat must be political unity in Libya.

""It is therefore urgent that the recently-signed political accord be enacted,"" he said in a statement, allowing the new government to ""concentrate on the common fight against terrorism and on the reconstruction and pacification of the country.""

11401073,2016-07-31,"Results of vote had been largely expected as criticism mounted

Tunisia is looking to form a new government after lawmakers fired the prime minister in the latest skirmish reflecting the struggle for political stability and economic growth in the birthplace of the Arab Spring.

A total of 118 of 217 lawmakers voted late Saturday in favor of a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Habib Essid. The vote sets the stage for a new national unity government sought by President Beji Caid Essebsi for weeks. Essid becomes a caretaker leader with a new prime minister named within 10 days and a government seated a month after that, according to the country's constitution.

Essid's government didn't follow through on pledges to revive the economy, Ibrahim Nasfi, a lawmaker from the Nidaa Tounes party, said in an interview after the vote.

While Tunisia has largely avoided the political instability and violence that ravaged Arab Spring nations such as Libya and Egypt, the gains made for democracy weren't matched in the economy. Youth unemployment remains high despite being cited as a priority by successive governments since the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.

The challenges have been compounded a series of terrorist attacks that have battered the vital tourism industry. In May, the International Monetary Fund approved a $2.88 billion, four-year loan aimed at supporting Tunisia's economic and financial reform program.

Opposition had been mounting to Essid, who refused to resign and vowed to take the issue to parliament. Ahead of the vote, Ennahda, a one-time moderate Islamist party that voted to keep politics and religion separate after losing seats in parliament, said it voted against him to ""make way for the formation of a national unity government with a political base able to deliver"" more of what Tunisians have been calling for in terms of opportunities and economic growth.

Sudan has deported at least 442 Eritreans this month, including six registered refugees, putting them at risk of government abuse in their home country, Human Rights Watch said.

The Eritreans were caught and repatriated in two groups, at least one of which had been planning to cross into Libya, the New York-based rights organization said in a statement on its website. Eritrea requires all citizens younger than 50 to participate in national service, often for an extended period, with those leaving the country without permission risking imprisonment and torture on their return, Human Rights Watch said.

""Sudan is arresting and forcing Eritreans back into the hands of a repressive government without allowing refugees to seek protection,"" said Gerry Simpson, the organization's senior refugee researcher. Sudanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali al-Sadig declined to comment when contacted by phone.

Sudan is a major transit point for Horn of Africa migrants who travel on to Libya and Egypt, with many then trying to cross to Europe by boat. The European Union says it's working with Sudan and other countries in the region on steps including tightening border controls and improving the lives of potential migrants in their home countries.

Refugees' Rights

Human Rights Watch said it's concerned over whether Sudan will respect refugees' rights as it cooperates with the EU. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was denied access by Sudanese authorities to identify the Eritreans and Ethiopians held this month who may have wanted to claim asylum, Human Rights Watch said.

Sixty-four Ethiopians caught with some of the Eritreans seeking to travel to Libya are still detained in Sudan and risk deportation, according to the group. Ethiopia's restrictions on political rights have spurred citizens to leave and a crackdown that began November in its Oromia region may have led to ""thousands"" fleeing to neighboring countries, Human Rights Watch said.

11401075,2016-05-18,"Top officials from 21 countries and four major international organizations want Libya's fledgling unity government to receive weapons to fight Islamic State militants dug in along Mediterranean shores.

The U.S., Russia, European powers, as well as Libya's neighbors, are attempting to build the first stable government since NATO countries intervened in 2011 to oust Muammar Qaddafi. Here's a guide to how decisions made at diplomatic meetings this week in Vienna could change Libya's direction.

QuickTake Libya's Breakdown

Who governs Libya?

Well, no one. Or at least not anywhere near the whole country. Elections in 2014 were disputed, leading to a government in Tripoli that refused to cede power and an internationally recognized parliament that decamped to the eastern city of Tobruk.

The United Nations brokered a deal in December to create a unity administration headed by Fayez al-Sarraj, who has been in Tripoli since March. While Sarraj has steadily built support, and on Tuesday ordered key ministries to begin work, dissidents in the capital and the east have prevented the creation of a new government with full powers.

Adding further complexity, Islamic State controls territory around the central coastal town of Sirte, while General Khalifa Haftar, a self-proclaimed savior of Libya whose Libyan National Army militia has been attacking Islamist militants, leads the country's most effective fighting force.

Libya has between 10 and 12 major militias vying for territory, power and influence, said Mattia Toaldo, a Libya analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. Hundreds of smaller ones also hold territory, some as little as a few streets in a city.

Who would receive the weapons, and how soon?

Libya has been under a UN arms embargo since 2011, with the latest modifications approved by the Security Council two years ago. Monday's meeting in Vienna won't lift the sanctions but allows Sarraj to apply for exemptions ""to procure necessary lethal arms and material to counter UN-designated terrorist groups.""

The meeting called for a joint command structure to combine military forces of the Tripoli and Tobruk administrations. According to Toaldo, that would take months but ""something that could satisfy the Security Council could be ready in a few weeks."" Sarraj said he would supply the UN with a list of needed weapons ""as soon as possible.""

Why is the international community so concerned?

Libya hosts Islamic State's most successful franchise outside its Syrian and Iraqi bases. Terrorists based in Libya carried out deadly attacks in Tunisia and tried to occupy a border town in early March, only being repelled after intense fighting. There are between 3,000 and 6,500 Islamic State fighters in Libya, according to the Jamestown Foundation, mostly from existing militias that declared their allegiance, but also foreign fighters.

""Islamic State doesn't hold large amounts of Libyan territory"" but uses the areas it does hold to support affiliates in Sinai, Yemen and Somalia, Hans-Jacob Schindler, an expert with the UN's sanctions monitoring team, said by phone from New York.

Libya's shores were once the main embarking point for migrants seeking refuge in Europe, with thousands a year dying before reaching Sicily. Later an alternative route through Turkey dominated. But with a Turkey-European Union curbing refugee movements, traffickers could attempt to revive the shipping of desperate families from Libyan soil.

Libya has Africa's largest proven crude reserves. Competing factions of Libya's state-run National Oil Corp. have agreed to resume exports from the Hariga port to revive the OPEC member's production.

What chance unity?

Haftar has been the main figure standing in the way of a unity government but that could change, says Umberto Profazio, an adviser at Rome-based Institute for International Affairs. ""Haftar is very popular among those with a nostalgia for a strongman,"" he said. ""But if he was offered a major job in a new government, such as head of the army or an important ministry, he could accept.""

Sarraj's government has created a presidential guard that could receive weapons, he said. And Sarraj went to Egypt and appears to have won the backing of President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who in the past supported Haftar.

""The risk of course is that the weapons aren't used solely against Islamic State, but to settle scores among competing factions. Plus there's the question of whether one should send weapons to a country that has plenty of them,"" Profazio said.

Did foreign military intervention cease in 2011?

Not at all. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said on Monday that ""small teams of U.S. forces"" are in Libya to gather intelligence about Islamic State. France, Britain and Italy also have special forces or intelligence officers in country, according to reports in those countries. U.S. warplanes in February bombed an IS training camp, and in November attacked another militant group.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. ""won't hesitate"" to carry out further airstrikes. But he said that's ""not a substitute"" to building up the fighting capacities of the Government of National Accord.

In January, Italy and the U.S. agreed to allow American drones to fly from Sigonella military base in Sicily. France has troops in Niger, Mali and Chad, in part to prevent incursions from militants based in southern Libya. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni Monday ruled out putting ""boots on the ground"" in Libya. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, have been providing military support for Haftar.

German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that the European Union's refugee deal with Turkey is at risk as proposals for visa-free travel for Turks run into turbulence.

De Maiziere, 62, a confidant of Chancellor Angela Merkel, made it clear the German leader won't be diverted from her goal of stemming migration at the EU's outer borders rather than within the 28-nation bloc. The EU's refugee deal struck with Turkey in March is working, even though the country still needs to fulfill all of the conditions laid down in the pact, he said.

""We see the following risks: to start, that the accord between the EU and Turkey collapses due to the government crisis in Turkey, due to disagreements over the issue of visa liberalization,"" de Maiziere, 62, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday.

One of Merkel's longest-serving cabinet members, de Maiziere's acknowledgment of the risk of trouble ahead adds to signs that the accord reached with Ankara to curb the influx of refugees to Europe may come undone. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stepped up his rhetoric challenging the EU, and a former Erdogan adviser said Wednesday that Turkey would send refugees to Europe should the EU Parliament make a ""wrong decision"" in the deliberations over visa-free status for Turkey.

""One shouldn't take every interview with an adviser too seriously,"" de Maiziere said in the interview at his ministry, across the Spree River in Berlin from Merkel's chancellery. ""Visa-free travel will come once Turkey fulfills the criteria it has to meet."" EU governments and the bloc's parliament must then approve it, and ""that will be hard,"" he said.

De Maiziere credited the accord and border closings in the Western Balkans with drastically reducing the refugee influx to Germany this year, partly by signaling to migrants that most of them have no hope of winning asylum if they reach Greece from Turkey. The deal's centerpiece is the EU's offer of 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion) in aid in return for Turkey restricting the flow of refugees to Europe.

Pursuing Deals

""Naturally, we are very satisfied with the decline,"" de Maiziere said. On Turkey, ""we're adamant that all the pieces of the agreement will be fulfilled, on both sides.""

Europe needs to pursue similar deals with North African countries such as Libya and Tunisia, though war and political instability make that effort ""much more complicated,"" he said.

""It's a pretty long road,"" de Maiziere said. ""But we have to take it.""

De Maiziere, who is the minister charged with ensuring law and order in Germany, also hinted at her government's emerging strategy for countering advances by Alternative for Germany, an anti-immigration party spurred by the arrival of some 1 million asylum seekers last year, the most since World War II. Polls suggest the party has as much as 15 percent voter support, enough to win seats in the federal parliament if elections were held now. Germany's next national vote is due in the fall of 2017.

Pandering

Europe's established parties can't defeat populist movements by adopting similar policies or labeling them extremists, he said, citing Austria as proof that pandering to populists won't work. Directing rare criticism at a neighboring country's government, he said that Austria, whose Social Democratic chancellor resigned Monday in the latest fallout from Europe's refugee crisis, ""certainly can't be a model for Europe.""

""We have populist parties all over Europe, in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Britain, Sweden, Finland and now also in Germany,"" de Maiziere said. ""Now all of us, not just Austria, are confronted with the question of how to react.""

Calling populist parties ""right-wing extremists"" or adopting their rhetoric ""will fail"" because they channel ""understandable fears"" among voters regarding globalization or immigration, he said.

""There are no easy answers to complicated questions,"" he said. ""The modern world is complicated. It leads to change. We have to have the confidence and strength to handle this within a framework of freedom and pluralism.""

11401077,2016-05-11,"Tanks at Hariga will be full in 4 weeks: NOC spokesman Harari Crude exports through port account for 75% of Libya's total

Fields responsible for the bulk of Libya's oil exports will be forced to halt production within a month unless a blockade is lifted on the port of Marsa el-Hariga, according to the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp.

""In less than four weeks we will have to shut production completely because the tanks at Hariga will be full,"" Mohamed Harari, a spokesman for NOC, said in an e-mailed statement late on Monday. ""The blockade will cause serious harm and bring no benefits.""

Factions controlling the east of the North African nation said April 30 that they wouldn't allow any tankers to depart Hariga without their approval. The move came after the region's bid to sell a crude cargo independently of the NOC in Tripoli was stymied as the United Nations blacklisted the shipment. Output from the nation has slumped about 80 percent since the 2011 ouster of dictator Muammar Al Qaddafi as different groups compete for control of oil facilities.

Oil officials in eastern Libya said Monday that they have no plans to block shipments from Hariga. No tankers have left the port since April 28, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. The tanker Seachance is still moored off eastern Libya after being prevented from exporting 1 million barrels of crude from the terminal, the data show.

Rising Tensions

As tensions rise between the UN-backed western-based government of national unity led by Fayez al Serraj and a rival administration in the east, oil production by Arabian Gulf Oil Co., which ships crude through Hariga, has dropped to 90,000 barrels a day from 240,000 barrels, the producer said last week.

Exports from the port account for three quarters of the country's total, Harari said, adding that payments to the central bank will dry up and the dinar will be affected if eastern fields are shut down. Oil flowing from some of the fields to Hariga is high in wax and will solidify in the pipelines if it doesn't move, causing permanent production loss, he said.

""Open the ports for the wellbeing of our country,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in the statement. ""Unity is the only solution.""

11401078,2016-04-22,"German chancellor says accord offers path to legal migration

German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed back against critics of the European Union's refugee accord with Turkey and pressed her EU partners to help resettle migrants more evenly across the region.

Two days before scheduled talks with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu at Gaziantep near the Syrian border, Merkel insisted that the agreement with Turkey to send back refugees across the Aegean Sea is the best chance to stem the flow of migrants to Europe. The chancellor spoke on Thursday as she received the Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award in the Dutch city of Middelburg, partly for her open-door policy on refugees.

It was a rebuff to criticism in Germany and Europe of Merkel's push to enlist Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's help and questions about the accord's legality.

""The EU-Turkey agreement negotiated four weeks ago offers a real perspective to end the horrible business of smuggling in the Aegean,"" Merkel said in a speech. ""Far too many people have died as they flee. The EU-Turkey accord truly didn't come early enough.""

As Europe grapples with the influx of more than 1 million refugees since last year, the EU said this week that its agreement with Turkey is helping stem the flow. Leaders are turning to the prospect of new migration routes as the path via Greece through the Balkans has closed, foreshadowed by a United Nations report that 500 migrants may have drowned in a sea-crossing attempt from Libya to Italy.

Merkel faced a hail of criticism last week after granting Turkey's request to allow the prosecution of a German satirist who directed a lewd poem at Erdogan. The episode exposed a rift in her government and the discomfort of dealing with a leader scaling back press freedoms.

Seeking 'Solidarity'

Merkel defended the agreement's legal foundation and said EU leaders must move ahead on a distribution system for refugees, which many member states have resisted.

""It's now important that we continue efforts in solidarity toward a distribution of refugees in Europe,"" Merkel said.

The March 18 agreement, under which illegal migrants who enter the EU in Greece are sent back to Turkey and Syrian refugees in Turkish camps are resettled in Europe, is meant to discourage people smuggling and dangerous sea crossings. So far, 325 migrants, including two Syrians, have been sent to Turkey from Greece and 103 Syrian refugees on Turkish soil have been resettled in the EU, the European Commission said Wednesday in Brussels.

11401079,2016-04-22,"German chancellor's realpolitik risks leaving voters behind

Angela Merkel is pushing the boundaries of her realpolitik.

A leader whose pragmatism trumps ideology every time, the German chancellor faces international criticism, alienated voters and a rift in her coalition because of her choices in combating the refugee crisis.

QuickTake Libya

That might just be the start of her difficulties. With the European Union deal she pushed with Turkey beginning to deter illegal migration, Merkel is shifting her focus to the surge in refugee flows across the central Mediterranean to Italy. And that means engaging with Libya and Egypt.

Merkel will host U.S. President Barack Obama and the leaders of the U.K., France and Italy in Hanover, western Germany, on Monday to discuss Libya and migration, Syria and Islamic State, along with what the White House described as additional steps NATO allies must take to address the ""challenges on Europe's eastern and southern periphery.""

German intelligence suggests some one million refugees are waiting in the Maghreb countries to cross to Europe, causing alarm in the Chancellery in Berlin, according to an official from Merkel's party who asked not to be named discussing internal deliberations.

German foreign policy is now ""driven by the domestic imperative to bring down the number of refugees: this is Merkel's live-or-die issue,"" said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Germany is set to become ""much more active"" in North Africa, and ""for Merkel this is a challenge, because you have to be cautious about doing things that the public doesn't understand.""

Insulting Erdogan

Faced with Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War II, Merkel is being forced to shed her traditional caution and expand her engagement into geopolitical spheres traditionally off-limits to Germany. Her dilemma: the further she reaches, the harder it is to keep voters on board, risking a backlash that further undermines her domestic standing at a time when Europe is beset by instability on all fronts.

Take Turkey. Merkel was accused of sacrificing press freedom to appease President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after she allowed the prosecution of a German comedian for insulting him. The decision was contested by her coalition partner, criticized by Human Rights Watch and prompted a drop in her approval rating to the lowest level of her third term.

Yet she's already looking to replicate the Turkey deal with Europe's ""many other neighbors,"" Merkel told reporters Monday. Libya ""gives us particular worry,"" so Germany is seeking to help build a unity government in the war-torn state under Fayez Serraj even without it having parliamentary legitimacy or an army at its command, she said.

""A lot of refugees from Africa are in Libya,"" said Merkel. ""Naturally, it's not as easy to conduct negotiations there and to get some kind of burden-sharing as with Turkey.""

It's the latest example of how Merkel, driven by the imperative to stabilize Europe, has rebooted German foreign policy in her 10 years in office. First, Greece compelled her to openly embrace Germany's role as Europe's economic leader, then Russian aggression in Ukraine saw her become Europe's counterpoint to Vladimir Putin. Now she's being forced to look beyond Europe's borders in an attempt to get at the root cause of migration from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi is emerging as the next partner, with Merkel dispatching one of her top lieutenants to Cairo to meet with him this month. Volker Kauder, the parliamentary leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, pledged German help in securing the border with Libya.

""The yardstick for whom we talk to and with whom we are ready to make agreements always has to be whether we can influence events in a positive direction,"" said Juergen Hardt, the foreign-policy spokesman for Merkel's bloc in parliament. ""Germany's well-being depends on it.""

The diplomacy was given added urgency by a United Nations report Wednesday that 500 migrants traveling from Libya to Italy may have drowned, highlighting the fact human traffickers are already switching routes away from the Aegean. Germany is among EU nations that agreed to consider sending a five-warship fleet closer to Libya's coast to deter trafficking.

Italy, which is once again becoming the main landing point for refugees as the so-called Balkan route is closed off, has floated its own plan to stem migration across the central Mediterranean.

Merkel's coalition is meanwhile pressing for Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to win EU designation as so-called safe-origin countries, a step that would ease the process of repatriating citizens who don't qualify for asylum in Germany.

Time may be running out for such agreements. Three state ballots in the first half of next year followed by the federal election next fall means German policy-making effectively ends in 2016, according to another person familiar with the chancellor's strategy. If she runs, the key to a fourth term for Merkel will be if she can keep voters on her side with her version of realpolitik.

""There was a sense that Germany's role in the middle of this was to simply enjoy it and not to have to defend it,"" Hamilton said in an interview. ""That's the difference: Either you project stability east and south or instability comes to you. That is what Germany is grappling with.""

The March 18 agreement, under which irregular migrants who enter the EU in Greece are sent back to Turkey and Syrian refugees in Turkish camps are resettled in Europe, is meant to discourage people smuggling and dangerous sea crossings. The returns to Turkey from Greece started on April 4.

So far, 325 irregular migrants -- including two Syrians -- have been sent to Turkey from Greece and 103 Syrian refugees on Turkish soil have been resettled in the EU, the European Commission, the 28-nation bloc's executive arm, said on Wednesday in Brussels.

""The message is starting to get through that turning to smugglers is the wrong choice to make,"" Frans Timmermans, the commission's principal vice president, said in a statement.

The combination of the EU-Turkey deal and the stranding of Mideast refugees in Greece as a result of the reintroduction of national border checks along the Balkans migrant route to northern Europe has caused Aegean Sea crossings to Greek islands from the Turkish coast to slump. The number of refugees arriving in Greece by sea more than halved to 26,971 in March from February and fell further to 2,257 in the first 17 days of April, according to the United Nations.

""We have seen a sharp decrease in irregular arrivals, which now needs to go hand-in- hand with opening up the legal channel of resettlement to those in need of protection,"" Timmermans said.

As the EU gets control of migrant arrivals from Turkey that number around 1 million since early 2015 and represent Europe's biggest refugee wave since World War II, the bloc faces the threat that human traffickers will begin sending hordes of people in war-torn Libya to Europe.

EU President Donald Tusk warned last week of ""alarming"" numbers of potential migrants in Libya. Italy, which would be the EU entry point for many of those people, called over the weekend for more European cooperation on the matter.

11401083,2016-03-03,"Wheat crop may fall more than 50% from last year, survey shows 'Harvest is going to be catastrophic,' grain farmer warns

Morocco's drought has probably wiped out half of its wheat harvest -- devastating a country where even the King has called on the nation to pray for rain.

The driest start to winter in two decades in the center of the country has decimated crops in Africa's second-biggest wheat grower, where just 15 percent of fields are irrigated. Imports may double to a record next season to account for the reduced harvest, a Bloomberg survey of six analysts showed.

Moroccans consume more than three times as much wheat as the global average, eating it in everything from thick soups to filo-dough pastry. The grain is a staple in North Africa, where higher food costs and shortages in the past six years helped trigger unrest that led to the toppling of governments in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. The drought evoked King Mohammed VI to lead rare national rain prayers after normal Friday worship for a second time in January.

""The harvest is going to be catastrophic,"" said Abdelaziz Oumarrou, a 31-year-old farmer whose 5 hectares (12 acres) near the city of Midelt support his family of four. ""This kind of agriculture has no future. We have to change and start doing things such as irrigating.""

Dry weather will slow economic growth to 1.2 percent from 3.8 percent last year, researcher Centre Marocain de Conjoncture said last month. Agriculture's contribution to the economy ranges from 12 percent to 17 percent because harvests are so rain reliant. The government wants to boost farming, partly though subsidizing seeds and irrigation equipment.

Not Enough?

The most rain since September fell in wheat-growing central regions in the 10-days to Feb. 20. Still, the drought has been so bad that total precipitation this season has been 77 percent below normal, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service show.

The country may harvest 3.72 million metric tons of wheat this year, 54 percent below 2015's record and the lowest in four years, the average estimate in the Bloomberg survey showed. To meet demand for its 34 million people, the country may almost double imports to 4.76 million tons in the 2016-17 season.

More imports may benefit growers particularly in France, researcher Agritel said. French farmers have been among the hardest hit by a global surplus that's swelling world grain stockpiles to a three-decade high and has pushed wheat prices to a five-year low.

""If you have to import a lot, the market is favorable,"" said Caroline Bitton, an analyst at Paris-based Agritel. ""We've seen the Moroccans buying very actively since January to cover immediate needs but also to build some stocks.""

Moroccan farmers had planted 3.2 million hectares of grains by early February for this year's harvest, about 40 percent less than usual, the national federation of grain traders said. Satellite data show plant strength similar to the poor crop harvest in 2007, said Bob Ellison, a spokesman for the USDA's FAS. Wheat output that year fell to 1.58 million tons.

Oumarrou, who has been farming since he was a teenager, said this is one of the worst years in memory and the recent rains probably won't save his crops.

""Rain is welcome, but it might be too late to reverse the impact,"" said Monika Tothova, an economist at the United Nations' Food & Agriculture Organization.

Libya splintered into rival political and armed groupings after the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and remains deeply divided between factions based in the east and west that backed rival governments and parliaments.

The leaders of a U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) arrived in Tripoli in March. But they have failed to fully displace the previous administration in Tripoli or win endorsement from power-brokers in the east, who accuse the GNA of being beholden to Islamist-leaning militias.

Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) have been fighting a two-year military campaign against Islamists and other opponents in Benghazi and elsewhere in the east. Many suspect he seeks national power.

Haftar is aligned with the eastern parliament and government, both of which were quick to congratulate Trump on his win.

""I strongly support Trump because of his and the Republicans' resolute and decisive attitudes,"" said Tarek al-Jaroushi, a member of the parliament whose father commands Haftar's air force. ""The Republican Party, which understands the truth about Daesh (Islamic State) and the positions and the victories of the Libyan army, will support us.""

A statement from the parliament to Trump said: ""We hope for your support ... and we call for the lifting of the arms embargo on the Libyan army which is waging a war against terrorism.""

Trump's win is likely to result in a retreat of U.S. support for the struggling GNA's leadership, or Presidential Council, said Claudia Gazzini, a Libya analyst at International Crisis Group.

""Up until now it's the U.S. Democratic administration that has been the major cheerleader of the Presidential Council, and the U.S. position on Libya has really dictated the international alignments, at least among Western countries,"" she said.

That could benefit Haftar, who in September seized control of key oil terminals from a rival faction aligned with the GNA.

Change is unlikely in U.S. counter-terrorism policy in Libya, which has included air strikes against Islamic State in its former stronghold of Sirte, said Frederic Wehry of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, but shuttle diplomacy and ""the follow-on task of rebuilding Libya's government and especially security"" could be reduced.

Any lessening of U.S. involvement in Libya could leave regional powers freer to act. In recent years western factions including Islamists have been close to Qatr and Turkey, whilst their eastern rivals have relied on support from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Haftar's allies have also cultivated ties with Russia, which printed banknotes for an eastern breakaway branch of Libya's central bank.

Trends in eastern Libya of ""disengagement from party politics, a tightening of control over civil society, over mosques, over journalism"" are a reflection of what is happening in Egypt, and close relations between Trump and Sisi could ""strongly affect Libya"", said Wehry.

Egypt said its President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was the first international leader to congratulate Trump by telephone. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is ready to repair ties with the U.S. under Trump.

On Facebook, some Libyan supporters of Haftar expressed hope that a Trump victory would lead to a crackdown on Islamists in the region.

Opponents said they would fight to defend the 2011 revolution regardless. In one widely shared post a woman from the western city of Misrata wrote: ""They (the LNA) may be supported by Trump, Russia, Sisi, and Haftar, but we still have God with us.""

11401168,2016-10-07,"The pledge is a sign authorities in the east, who have resisted a U.N.-backed unity government in Tripoli, may not try to take direct control of oil resources and revenues, at least for now. They have previously failed in attempts to export oil independently.

Agila Saleh, president of the east's House of Representatives (HOR), said production should be managed by a unified National Oil Corporation (NOC) and revenues distributed fairly across Libya.

His comments came after the state-run NOC reopened major oil terminals seized last month by eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, boosting national production by more than 200,000 barrels per day (bpd).

""The revenues of oil will be deposited in the central bank of Libya and will be for all Libyans according to geographic distribution and density of population,"" Saleh said. ""All Libyans benefit from this wealth.""

The HOR has been based in the eastern city of Tobruk since 2014, when rival armed factions took control of Tripoli, deepening the political turmoil and conflict that emerged after an uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Libya was left with two competing sets of institutions in Tripoli and the east, including rival branches of the NOC and the central bank.

The U.N.-backed government is now operating from Tripoli, but has failed to win endorsement from the east. Its leadership is currently drawing up a new list of ministers after seeing two proposed cabinets rejected by the HOR.

The NOC announced a deal to unite in July. The central bank is still divided, though NOC revenues continued to go through the bank's Tripoli headquarters throughout Libya's conflict.

Saleh he was planning to meet NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and eastern central bank governor Ali Hibri, noting the HOR had previously sacked Tripoli central bank governor Sadiq al-Kabir.

""We will work to draft a new agreement with the (eastern) parliament's finance committee for harmonizing operations in the Libyan central bank and the NOC,"" he said.

Conflict, political disputes and local protests had reduced Libya's oil output to a fraction of the 1.6 million bpd the OPEC member was producing before the 2011 uprising.

Following the NOC's reopening of terminals seized by Haftar, national production rose this week above 500,000 bpd, from lows over the summer of between 200,000 and 300,000 bpd.

The European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on Saleh, accusing him of blocking political progress in Libya. HOR members who support the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) have said they were repeatedly obstructed from holding or participating in votes to approve it.

Saleh dismissed the sanctions as a ""violation of Libyan sovereignty and democracy"". He said he would accept civil society observers to monitor any future vote, but they had to be Libyan.

""The government has to be small, given the condition of the country, and it has to take into account all parts of Libya, east and west, and all constituents of the Libyan people,"" he said.

11401169,2016-09-25,"Fayez Seraj also told Reuters in an interview that the battle against Islamic State militants in their former stronghold of Sirte was in its last stages, although bombings and booby traps still posed a challenge.

Gaddafi's fall in 2011 brought chaos that splintered the North African country into rival armed fiefdoms. The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) has been seeking endorsement for months as it tries to extend its authority beyond its base in Tripoli, in western Libya.

""In the last five years, Libya has been through a very difficult and critical phase ... many political divisions,"" Seraj said in New York, where he was attending an annual U.N. gathering of world leaders. ""There was disintegration of the social fabric as a result of bloody conflicts.

""So we need a real reconciliation between Libyans inside and Libyans abroad ... there will be no exclusion of any political faction,"" he said. ""Reconciliation will provide political stability, which will give way for economic stability.""

Seraj said he expected to begin the drive before the end of the year but he faces an unenviable task.

General Khalifa Haftar, who has been waging a military campaign against Islamists and other opponents in Benghazi and the east, and his backers in eastern Libya have been in a stand-off with the GNA for months. They have blocked a parliamentary vote to endorse the GNA and challenging the U.N.-mediated deal to unify Libya.

Haftar also has resisted the GNA's efforts to integrate his self-styled Libyan National Army into the national armed force.

The eastern-based parliament has twice rejected lists of ministers put forward by the GNA's leadership, or Presidential Council, which is meant to represent all sides of Libya's fractured politics.

The Presidential Council has struggled to win popular support and secure the loyalty of Libya's political and armed factions since they arrived in Tripoli from Tunisia in March.

Frustration has mounted at its inability to tackle everyday problems including a liquidity crisis, frequent kidnappings, power cuts and a failing health system.

""We expect within coming weeks to end negotiations on shaping a new government,"" Seraj said.

""We have, until now, not received any official letter from the parliament to present again a newly reshaped government. Despite that we dealt positively with the results of the parliament ... (it) has to now bear its responsibility and carry out its duty,"" he said.

Seraj has said repeatedly he was open to talks with Haftar, whose recent seizure of oil ports has risked deepening the long-standing east-west divisions and alarmed the west.

""As a Presidential Council we are open to all political factions ... I have no reservations. Anything that helps solve the Libyan crisis and that can open bottlenecks, we are ready to meet anyone,"" he said.

Seraj struck a conciliatory tone over the port seizures but warned that protection of the vital installations had be done by the internationally recognized government.

""We would not have hoped that there would be escalation in the area but what happened has happened ... and we tried to deal with it with wisdom and calculation,"" Seraj said.

""But we sent a clear message that oil installations must be protected and should not be damaged ... Whoever protects the oil must be under the umbrella of the Presidential Council,"" he said.

Haftar's forces handed operational control to the National Oil Corporation (NOC), which Seraj said operated under the Presidential Council.

11401171,2016-08-08,"TUNIS While U.S. jets and drones are pounding Islamic State in the Libyan city of Sirte, Western powers are unlikely to expand their military involvement rapidly, anxious to avoid exacerbating factional divisions as the government they support struggles to establish itself.

The United Nations-backed government asked for the U.S. air strikes which began on Aug. 1, but it has still not made a long-awaited request for broader security help - including a possible easing of an international arms embargo on the factions which emerged during and after the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

""They know that the international community is ready to help with training and advice, but specific requests are not emerging yet,"" said a Western diplomatic source.

Forces aligned to the Government of National Accord (GNA), which set up in Tripoli four months ago, have battled for weeks to remove Islamic State fighters from Sirte, the jihadist group's former North African stronghold.

Now U.S. ""Operation Odyssey Lightning"" is targeting tanks, armed pick-up trucks and fighting positions in the slowly shrinking area of Sirte that Islamic State still holds, easing the passage for Libyan ground forces.

However, the GNA has moved slowly to formulate its own security strategy and seek more foreign help, handicapped by internal political splits, a lack of capacity, and sensitivity to criticism that it is dependent on external support, Libyan and Western officials say.

Discussion of a 5,000-strong Italian-led peace keeping mission has fizzled out, and foreign ground intervention has been limited to small-scale special forces deployments.

Coastguard training is being planned, but programs to train and equip national security and police forces have yet to be developed.

One request that is expected sooner or later is for exemptions to the U.N. arms embargo. World powers said in May they were ready to consider this to help the GNA combat Islamic State, but much depends on its ability to show that arms will not end up in the wrong hands, from a Western point of view.

Among the likely recipients would be fighters from the city of Misrata, which lies roughly midway between Tripoli and Sirte.

They have backed the GNA, providing security in Tripoli and leading the battle against Islamic State in Sirte, Gaddafi's home town.

However, the loyalty of Libya's armed factions has been fickle in the past and the GNA's leadership, or Presidential Council, has yet to form a unified military command structure.

""Only regular units under the command of the Presidential Council will get an exemption from the arms embargo,"" U.N. Libya envoy Martin Kobler told Reuters.

""The Presidential Council has to be accepted as the Supreme Commander of the army. The question is does it really have control over the Misrata forces? Maybe yes, maybe no.""

The Misrata brigades say they will return home after securing Sirte from Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

However, some people see a risk of renewed conflict between loose alliances of armed groups that fought for control of Tripoli in 2014. The fear is that the Misrata brigades will end up fighting forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, a military commander based in eastern Libya.

Haftar and his allies have so far loudly rejected the GNA, and foreign powers intervening anywhere in Libya risk being seen to take sides among the local factions.

""The challenge for the West will always be to surgically fight ISIS whenever that implies not getting dragged into Libya's civil war,"" said Mattia Toaldo, a Libya expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The limited foreign involvement so far has met with a mixed reception locally. While the United States and Britain are popular around Misrata, France is out of favor there.

French special forces have been operating for months in the eastern city of Benghazi, where fighters loyal to Haftar have been battling opponents including Islamic State.

After three French soldiers were killed last month in a helicopter crash south of Benghazi, confirming their presence, there were protests in Misrata and Tripoli, and the GNA summoned the French ambassador.

However, the U.S. strikes against Islamic State - both in Sirte and in the western city of Sabratha in February - have provoked few protests.

Libyan militants returning from fighting in the Syrian civil war helped to implant Islamic State in the country in 2014, but the group has struggled to win support or hold territory, with most local people regarding it as a malign import dependent on foreign fighters.

The GNA-backed forces wonder why the U.S. strikes did not come sooner. ""We just want this fight to end, we'll take any help we can get,"" said one commander on the Sirte front line.

But that openness does not extend to the idea of foreign boots on the ground, or broader efforts to end the security vacuum that allowed Islamic State to gain a foothold.

""The need for outside help with training is certainly recognized at senior political level,"" the diplomat said. But in discussions about a peace keeping force, the Libyan position was very clear - nothing like the 'Green Zone', the secure international area of Baghdad, would be acceptable.

Even for training, ""any visible presence on the streets would be difficult"", said the diplomat.

This year nearly 50,000 migrants have arrived in Italy from North Africa, according to the International Organization for Migration, while some 2,000 have died trying.

11401176,2016-05-11,"ALGIERS Former Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil brushes off talk of presidential ambitions. But as he travels from town to town meeting officials and religious leaders, critics say the close ally of ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika looks very much as if he is on the campaign trail.

He is not the only one who appears to be maneuvering as debate intensifies over how long the veteran leader, largely out of sight since a stroke three years ago, will stay in office, and who may replace him if he steps aside.

Bouteflika has run the North African OPEC member for nearly two decades, riding out the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 partly due to fears of a return to chaos after the devastating war between Islamists and the military in the 1990s.

Anarchy in Libya, across the border to the east, is another stark reminder of how political transitions can go wrong.

Succession talk has been spurred by a medical trip to Geneva by Bouteflika in April and an unflattering photograph of him published on Twitter by Manual Valls, prime minister of France, which has a large Algerian community and a strong interest in its former colony.

Bouteflika was last seen openly in public two years ago when he voted from a wheelchair in a ballot in which he won a fourth term. Since then he has appeared only in brief state television videos, usually seated, greeting dignitaries like Ban Ki Moon at the Zeralda presidential residence.

Government officials and ruling party FLN loyalists dismiss doubts over Bouteflika's health, and warn pretenders they will have to wait until the president's term ends in 2019.

""No one will get rid of the president with a photograph on Twitter,"" FLN chief Amar Saadani told a party gathering. ""The president is fine, the country is fine, the party is fine.""

Bouteflika was ""running the country's affairs properly"" and Algerians were aware of his condition when they re-elected him in 2014, said Ahmed Ouyahia, leader of the second pro-government party, Rassemblement National Democratique.

That has not stopped opposition leaders discussing early elections and holding meetings to build a united front against a ""power vacuum"". Even some Bouteflika loyalists now talk quietly of positioning for his eventual departure.

At 79, Bouteflika is still praised by many Algerians as the man who led the North African state out of international isolation and the ""dark years"" of the war with armed Islamists that killed 200,000 people.

Talk of transition comes at a sensitive time, with a fall in oil prices hitting state finances, violence in neighboring Mali as well as Libya and the government seeking investment to keep its place as a key European gas supplier.

""The only issue is to return the sovereignty of the people through elections,"" opposition leader and former candidate Ali Benflis said. ""I didn't need to see that photograph to know we have a power vacuum.""

Algeria's politics are often opaque, and observers say they have been dominated since independence by behind-the-scenes power struggles over candidates and policies among FLN top cadre, pro-government business elites and generals.

Even before his re-election, Bouteflika moved steadily to erase the influence of the powerful DRS military intelligence service that had often played the role of kingmaker after independence in 1962 and extended its sway during the 1990s war.

Analysts say those bloody years of war mean Algeria's leaders will always prioritize stability over any factional disputes -- whether in any early elections or in 2019.

""The conditions and legal framework for a soft transition are now in place,"" political analyst Arslan Chikhaoui said. ""Anticipated elections or not, Bouteflika's key goal was to make sure Algeria would have evolution and not revolution.""

The question of who follows though is still unanswered. That debate, analysts say, risks delaying economic reforms to help shield the economy from the sharp fall in oil prices.

Since his return to Algeria this year after years in exile under the cloud of a corruption scandal, Khelil, a U.S. educated former World Bank technocrat and OPEC president, has been welcomed back by the FLN.

He has always denied the allegations against him and FLN chief Amar Saadani and oil executives hinted he could advise on energy reforms. Local media and opposition figures say he seems to be preparing to be a presidential candidate.

Visiting Sufi monasteries that are influential religious and social centers, especially in rural areas, and talking to the media, Khelil says he only wants to serve his country.

His critics question the timing of his return. Some suggest his tour is an attempt to rehabilitate himself; others say it is a distraction and ask what happened to the corruption probe.

""Let's not be surprised if the next step is forming committees to support Chakib Khelil,"" newspaper El Watan wrote in a recent column. ""What a turnout for a man who three years ago was supposed to meet with the judges.""

But Khelil and other potential presidential candidates may be disqualified under articles in the constitution barring those who have lived abroad for a long period or married a foreigner.

Among other names who observers say may emerge from pro-government factions are RND's Ouyahia and the FLN's Saadani, rivals who frequently spar in public, Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal, or even an outsider like Lakhdar Brahimi, the former U.N. negotiator who has visited Bouteflika multiple times.

Opposition parties, fractured and weak in the face of FLN dominance, are focused on three leaders -- Benflis, who was once part of the FLN, Said Sadi, founder of a liberal, Berber-focussed party, and moderate Islamist Abdallah Jaballah.

Khelil, like Bouteflika, and many in the president's inner circle, is from the west of the country, and analysts say his return has even stirred rivalries between leaders from west and east dating back to factions who fought against the French.

In Algiers, there is also a court battle over an Arabic-language newspaper between tycoon Issad Rebrab, who is from the east and has been linked to Sadi's opposition party, and the government, which Rebrab says is trying to curb his influence and control the press.

""Those in power, they are worried. They block me because I am not part of their clan,"" Rebrab, who has clashed with the government in the past, said in an interview in local media.

The communications ministry rejects that and says it has objected to Rebrab's takeover of the newspaper and television station on anti-monopoly grounds and because of media laws. An official told Reuters only the court could decide.

""This is a commercial issue,"" he said. ""I don't understand why Rebrab is saying it is politics.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Algeria', 'Libya', 'Geneva', 'Zéralda', 'Mali', 'United States', 'Algiers', 'France']",Bouteflika health check prompts political jostling in Algeria,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-algeria-politics-idUSKCN0Y2139,None,
11401177,2016-05-09,"TUNIS Talks on providing support for Libya's new unity government will be held in Vienna next week, Italy's foreign minister said on Monday.

The meeting will focus on international efforts to bring stability to Libya, where two rival governments have vied for power since 2014, opening the way for Islamic State to establish itself and gain ground in the North African state.

Regional foreign ministers will meet for the talks, according to Italy's Paolo Gentiloni. He did not give details on who would attend, but past talks on Libya have included the United States and European officials and Libya's North African neighbors.

Prime Minister Fayez Serraj's U.N-backed Government of National Accord arrived in Tripoli a month ago, but it has faced resistance from hardliners in both the Libyan factions running rival governments.

""There will be a meeting in Vienna on May 16 to support the government of Serraj and to push for stability in Libya,"" the minister said, according to a Tunisian foreign ministry statement. ""Regional foreign ministers and other important figures will be there.""

Five years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, western powers are backing Serraj's government as the best solution to chaos in Libya. They are waiting for a request from Serraj for military aid to help in the fight against Islamic State in Libya.

Islamic State took advantage of Libya's political turmoil to establish itself in Sirte last year. It controls a strip of coast about 250 km (155 miles) long around the city, but it has struggled to hold ground elsewhere in the country.

Western governments hope the U.N.-backed government will be able to unite Libya's armed factions to take on Islamic State. But efforts to counter the group have so far depended on loose alliances of armed brigades that supported the rival governments operating in Tripoli and the east.

11401178,2016-04-27,"BENGHAZI, Libya A government based in eastern Libya has shipped its first cargo of crude in defiance of authorities in the capital Tripoli, a bold move that could deepen the divisions that have brought chaos since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.

The Tripoli authorities asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to blacklist the India-flagged tanker Distya Ameya, which left the eastern Libyan port of Hariga overnight carrying oil they said could not be lawfully sold.

The eastern government has set up its own National Oil Corporation (NOC) to act in parallel to the Tripoli-based NOC that is recognized internationally as the only legitimate seller of Libyan oil.

The tanker departed Hariga carrying 650,000 barrels of crude late on Monday bound for Malta, said Mohamed al-Manfi, a spokesman for the eastern NOC.

Maltese national TV said the ship was in international waters near Malta. The island's Port Directorate said the tanker was not authorized to dock there and requests would be refused.

The ship last reported its position through the publicly available AIS tracking system earlier on Tuesday as still in Libyan waters.

Libya's economy depends almost exclusively on oil export revenue and the fight over who controls those funds has driven chronic instability and civil war since long-serving autocrat Gaddafi was toppled and killed by Western-backed rebels in 2011.

Parallel parliaments and governments have operated in Tripoli and the east since 2014. Much of the country is in the hands of dozens of armed groups loyal to one or other government, while small areas are controlled by Islamic State fighters.

Political division, labor disputes and security threats have reduced Libya's oil output to less than a quarter of the 1.6 million barrels per day produced before the uprising.

A U.N.-backed unity government, which arrived in the capital last month, includes figures from across Libya's divides but has not yet been fully accepted by either of the two loose alliances fighting for power since 2014.

It was not immediately clear how the eastern NOC could conduct a sale given the international opposition. One possibility might be to attempt a ship-to-ship transfer in international waters.

""We are concerned about purchases of Libyan oil outside of legitimate channels,"" U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday, emphasizing that all sales should go through the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation.

The United States has stopped unauthorized sales of Libyan oil in the past, sending special forces in 2014 to board a tanker off Cyprus loaded with crude shipped by a group pressing for more autonomy in eastern Libya. The U.S. troops forced that ship to return.

Another senior U.S. official declined to be drawn on whether Washington might undertake a similar operation, saying it would ""look at all appropriate mechanisms to address the situation.""

If the shipment went through, it could spark copycat sales that would further shrink the unity government's revenues.

""That's very bad for Libya and very threatening, potentially, to the viability of any Libyan government,"" the second U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.

Among U.S. concerns are that such oil sales could fund arms purchases by those resisting the unity government's authority.

The official said the United States and other nations could impose sanctions on those found to violate U.N. Security Council resolutions on Libya, though he did not provide details.

The eastern NOC has long been trying to sell its own oil, but until now those efforts have been blocked by the NOC in Tripoli, with the support of Western countries.

The NOC in Tripoli says any sale by its eastern rival would breach U.N. Security Council resolutions and put the future of Libya's economy at risk.

NOC Tripoli officials said on Tuesday they had notified the United Nations, countries with naval forces in the Mediterranean and a unity government now working in Tripoli that the shipment had not been authorized and should be stopped.

""We have done our job and we are waiting for them to do theirs,"" said spokesman Mohamed al-Harari.

The NOC in Tripoli has continued to run oil production throughout the crisis that followed Gaddafi's fall, with the funds paying state salaries across Libya, including many of the rival armed groups, which have generally been granted official status.

The Tripoli NOC has retained international backing, and says it is working to plan future oil sales with the new U.N.-backed unity government.

News of the eastern NOC's effort to export its first shipment of oil emerged late last week, when the NOC in Tripoli said it had prevented port workers from loading oil onto the Distya Ameya.

It said the shipment had been ordered for a company called DSA Consultancy FZC, registered in the United Arab Emirates.

* Faces struggle to absorb or disband powerful militias

* Success key to tackling Islamic State, raising oil output

By Aidan Lewis

TUNIS, April 4 In its first days in Tripoli, Libya's U.N.-backed unity government has tried to impose its authority swiftly by ordering a freeze on ministry budgets and securing the prime minister's office with the help of a powerful armed brigade.

A violent reaction by hostile militias has so far not materialised as feared. And from a heavily guarded naval base, the new government's leaders have begun charting the sprawling North African state's economic recovery in conjunction with the central bank and the National Oil Corporation (NOC).

But they still face a daunting task as they strive to unify and rebuild fractured institutions, boost oil production, and disband or absorb armed brigades that have established power bases while drawing on public salaries.

Those steps will be crucial not only to the government's survival, but also to countering Islamic State militants that have seized some pockets of Libya and to rescuing an economy in free fall due to reduced oil output and crude prices.

The unity government's leadership, or Presidential Council, arrived in Libya last Wednesday without securing the formal approval of either of the country's rival parliaments based in Tripoli and in the east of the country.

It has relied instead on the support or acquiescence of armed brigades that have controlled the capital since 2014, and earlier backed the self-declared National Salvation government.

But that same support risks stiffening opposition to the unity cabinet in Libya's east, the base of the National Salvation government's political adversaries and powerful anti-Islamist military commander Khalifa Haftar.

They may fear a western coup by their armed, Islamist-leaning rivals in Tripoli and the powerful port city of Misrata.

Aguila Saleh, president of the eastern parliament, hinted at such concerns when he said on Saturday that statements by some members of the Presidential Council ""suggest they are not comfortable with the military"".

""We will not allow the unity government to be under the control of militias in Tripoli,"" he said.

The brigades, who cast themselves as the guardians of the 2011 uprising that overthrew veteran autocrat Muammar Gaddafi, have proved a disruptive presence in the past, and their loyalties can be fickle.

Any attempt to integrate them into national security forces answering to the unity government, or to stop paying their salaries for defying any such step, could trigger violence.

""They are supporting the national unity government because they are very cleverly repositioning themselves in the new environment,"" said Riccardo Fabiani, a senior North Africa analyst at Eurasia Group.

""That doesn't mean they will support the government all the time. As soon as divisions appear in the unity government they will side with one minister or another, like they did until 2014.""

As well as appointing Haftar as military commander in the east, the government there has tried to set up parallel structures including an NOC and a central bank.

These bodies are considered largely powerless, however, and the Tripoli-based NOC and central bank have continued to operate on a national level throughout Libya's crisis.

However, oil output has been slashed by labour disputes, a lack of security, and regional and ethnic power struggles, and the eastern NOC has persisted in efforts to sell oil separately.

Ibrahim Jathran, a leader of the paramilitary Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) previously aligned with the eastern government, last week pledged support for the unity government and promised to reopen oil ports that his forces have blockaded.

But in a sign of the potential for further splits, Jathran's move prompted Battalion 152, a rival faction within the PFG, to declare that its loyalties lay solely with Haftar.

The eastern government has said it opposes any transfer of power before the unity government secures a long-sought vote of approval from the eastern parliament. The vote is a requirement of the U.N.-mediated deal under which the unity government was created, and is seen as symbolically important.

But the eastern NOC said on Monday that, even if the vote took place, it would carry on working out of Benghazi, the largest city in eastern Libya.

Haftar, with backing from Egypt's military, could also continue to operate independently, said Fabiani.

Responding to a request by the U.N.-backed Presidential Council and Western powers for an immediate transfer of power, Khalifa al-Ghwell told Reuters late on Tuesday he could not hand over authority to a government he said did not enjoy the support of Tripoli's parliament, the General National Congress (GNC).

The U.S. and major European powers recognized the unity cabinet as Libya's only legitimate government on Sunday, and are pushing for it to move to Tripoli and start work.

Ghwell, who leads a government appointed after armed brigades supporting the GNC won a battle for control of Tripoli in 2014 and reinstated it, said the U.N.-backed cabinet lacked the legitimacy to govern from the capital.

""If they want to enter Libya as individuals they are welcome, because they are Libyans. We don't advise them to enter Libya as a government, as to do so would be a violation to the law, and they will be treated according to the law,"" he said.

Western powers say the U.N.-backed government represents the best chance to end the chaos that has destabilized Libya since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising five years ago, and to tackle a security vacuum that has allowed Islamic State to thrive.

Some major armed brigades in western Libya and several dozen GNC members or former members have also pledged to support the new government.

But the Presidential Council and the unity cabinet it nominated last month have faced opposition from hardliners both in Tripoli and in the east, where an internationally recognized rival government is based.

Under the U.N.-backed plan for a political transition, the parliament in the east was meant to vote to adopt the plan and approve the unity government but has repeatedly failed to do so, though a majority of its members signed a statement supporting the unity government last month.

This month, three members of a security committee appointed to prepare for the unity government's move were briefly detained in Tripoli.

Ghwell said such decisions were taken by judicial authorities, but warned that members of the cabinet could face the same fate.

""We are a sovereign state and must secure our city and safeguard the security of our people, and if they try to come illegally they will create a unforeseen consequences in Tripoli and we don't agree with this,"" he said.

Ghwell backs parallel talks between members of the two governments in Libya, which he said were preparing an alternative plan for a political transition that he said would be presented in the next two weeks.

Eastern opposition to a transfer of power is centered on concerns over future military leadership among allies of powerful commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libya National Army has been leading battles against militants.

11401184,2016-02-24,"WADI BEY, Libya An hour's drive from the Libyan city of Sirte, a few dozen troops man outposts along a desert road. They are hoping the West will soon be giving them more help to fight a common enemy: Islamic State.

Armed with little more than gun-mounted pick-up trucks, they are a last line of defense against the Sunni Islamist group which controls swathes of Syria and Iraq and which has now taken advantage of chaos in the north African state to seize territory there. Sirte is its stronghold.

""They're getting stronger because no one is fighting them,"" said Misrata forces commander Mahmoud Gazwan at the Wadi Bey checkpoint, a dusty outpost serving as a mobile base for his brigade of fighters.

There are signs of a growing Western urgency to stop Islamic State (ISIS), and Libyan commanders say Western weapons and air strikes will make a vital difference in the coming battle against their better-armed enemy.

But Western officials say just as important is the need for a united Libya government to request more aid and for the Libyan forces ranged against IS to bridge their own deep divisions.

Five years after Muammar Gaddafi's overthrow and death, Libya is caught in a slow-burn civil war between two rival governments, one in Tripoli and one in the east. Each is backed by competing alliances of former rebel brigades whose loyalties are often more to tribe, region or local commander.

Forces from the port city of Misrata - one of the most powerful military factions - have been on the front line of the battle against Islamic State since it took over Sirte a year ago and drew more foreign fighters to its ranks there.

Islamic State militants are also fighting in Benghazi to the east, shelling the oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider. On Tuesday they attacked further west in Sabratha city.

U.S. special forces have been holding meetings with potential Libyan allies. U.S. and French drones and British RAF jets are flying reconnaissance missions in preparation for action to help the local forces fighting Islamic State.

An air raid by U.S. special forces on Sabratha killed more than 40 Islamic State fighters last week, but there are no international plans to send combat ground troops into Libya.

Western governments are wary of large-scale military intervention but fear inaction may allow Islamic State to take deeper root.

A U.S. government source said the Obama Administration was pursuing a two-track policy. One is to try to knit competing factions into an effective government. The other track involves air strikes.

""When you see an ISIL training camp and we see them doing push-ups and calisthenics every day, they're not there to lose weight,"" Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the international coalition fighting Islamic State, also known as ISIL or Daesh, told White House reporters.

""They're there to train for something, and we're not going to let them do that.""

U.S. and European officials say infighting between the rival administrations is blocking U.N. efforts to cajole them into a national government capable of rebuilding Libya's army.

Tripoli is held by a faction of Islamist-leaning brigades and Misrata fighters who took over the city in 2014 and drove out rivals. Misrata now backs the U.N. deal while some of the Tripoli political leadership is against it.

Libya's eastern government is backed by an alliance including the Libyan National Army led by former Gaddafi ally-turned rebel Gen. Khalifa Haftar, and a brigade controlling oil ports. Its ranks are split, including federalists looking for more autonomy for their eastern region.

The United Nations-backed presidential council is waiting for approval of its new government from the elected House of Representatives in the east.

Frustration is growing in Western capitals after repeated failures of the House to vote or reach a quorum to hold a ballot on the new government.

""We have always made clear the intention of providing assistance in fighting Daesh. We need to take action where we can, that requires forces on the ground that we can help and train,"" said one Western diplomat.

""Patience is very short with the House of Representatives.""

Italy said on Monday it would let U.S. armed drones take off from its soil to defend U.S.-led forces against Islamic State.

French special forces and intelligence commandos are engaged in covert operations against IS in Libya in conjunction with the United States and Britain, the French newspaper Le Monde reported on Wednesday. The French defense ministry declined to comment.

During the recent fighting in Sabratha, there were signs of cooperation among forces from Zintan and Sabratha brigades who back opposing sides in the wider national conflict.

Mattia Toaldo, a Libya expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, sees a convergence of forces who may agree on little but can work together against IS.

Misratan forces backed the new U.N.-supported government and could potentially work with rivals from Haftar's Libyan National Army and the oil guards, who are both aligned with the eastern government, Toaldo said.

""We are confident here we can win,"" says Mohamed al-Oreifi, one of the outpost commanders near the Sirte front line. ""But we need support and new weapons.""

As Islamic State has expanded in Libya -- taking over the city of Sirte and attacking oil ports -- so too have calls increased for a swift Western response to stop the group establishing a base outside its Iraq and Syria territory.

For Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria, sharing borders with Libya was already a security challenge as the country slipped into war between rival factions and allowed Islamic State to thrive five years after NATO strikes helped defeat Muammar Gaddafi.

Exactly what Western intervention is possible is still under discussion. But President Barack Obama has ordered security advisers to look to halt Islamic State, and U.S. officials say air strikes and special forces operations are options.

Italy's defense minister has said the West can not afford to let spring come and go without intervening, though most officials say they are pushing for a united Libya government first to ask for help on the ground.

North African officials back international attempts to bring Libya's factions together, but they worry they will pay the price in instability, refugees and militant counter attacks if an intervention happens without a government on the ground.

""Those countries who are envisaging a military intervention in Libya should before anything take into consideration the interests of the neighboring countries,"" Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said.

Tunisia's parliament speaker travels this week to Brussels to express the country's concerns over Western military action to his counterparts in the European Parliament.

In the years since Gaddafi fell in 2011, Libya has slipped deeper into chaos with two rival governments each backed by competing factions of former rebel brigades.

A U.N.-backed government of national accord is trying to win support, but is still awaiting parliamentary approval, and has yet to establish itself in the capital Tripoli.

Western officials and diplomats say air strikes, special forces operations are possible as well as an Italian-led ""security stabilization"" plan of training and advising.

U.S. and European officials insist Libyans must invite help through a united government, but say they may still carry out unilateral action if needed. The United States and its allies are already carrying out air strikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

Political delays in Libya are testing patience, however, and worrying North African governments.

""The people who wanted to first form a government, are now the same people in a hurry for intervention,"" one North African diplomat said. ""You need a unified action. If you are just planning air strikes, it won't get the results.""

Tunisia and Egypt face the most risk from Libya's crisis. Last year, Tunisian jihadists who trained in Libyan camps carried out two major attacks on foreign tourists in Tunisia.

More than 3,000 Tunisians have left to fight with Islamic State and other militant groups in Iraq and Syria, but Tunisian security sources say they believe many are returning to Libya.

Along the Libyan frontier, Tunisian authorities have built a 200-km (125 mile) barrier. Hospitals in Gafsa, Tataouine, Mednine and Gabes are prepared to receive wounded, and authorities have stockpiled supplies, officials say.

""These Tunisian fighters left here illegally and they know ways to cross back,"" a Tunisian security source said. ""We are vigilant for when they try to escape here if the coalition attacks on Islamic State start.""

Egypt has long urged the international community to help fight Islamist militancy in Libya. But Cairo has also been more circumspect about a full-blown Western military intervention.

Over the past 18 months, Egypt has ramped up border security and aerial surveillance and also carried out air strikes itself on Libyan militants. It has also relied on Bedouins whose familial links allow them to act lookouts on the border.

""This is a Libyan decision that no one should interfere with,"" Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. ""We hope that the Libyan government and the Libyan army ... will come out with something that will exclude the possibilities of intervention.""

With its own bloody history from a war with armed Islamists in 1990s, Algeria has been a key partner in the Western campaign against Islamist militancy in the Sahel, but it is also keen to maintain its traditional policy of non-interference.

Algerian border security was already tight since Islamist fighters crossed over from Libya to help in a 2013 attack on Algeria's In Amenas gas field, where 40 oil workers were killed.

Last month, Algerian forces arrested seven Libyan militants near the border close to In Amenas, and the army frequently stops weapons smuggled from Libya. Citing security concerns, Algeria last month also suspended flights to Libya.

""A major war in Libya would have a negative impact, more refugees and security risks,"" said Smail Djouhri, an ex-colonel and lecturer in security at Algiers University. ""Less Daesh in the region is also good news. A blow to them reduces their recruitment in North Africa.""

11401186,2016-01-06,"TUNIS Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid named 12 new ministers on Wednesday in a cabinet reshuffle he hopes will boost the effectiveness of his government as it battles jihadist violence and tries to revive the economy.

Tunisia has been under a state of emergency since an Islamic State suicide bomber attacked presidential guards in November in the capital Tunis following two previous militant attacks on foreign tourists that have damaged the country's economy.

Essid named new ministers of the interior, justice and foreign affairs, among others. He gave no reason for the changes but late last year he said he would replace ministers to increase the efficiency of his government.

Tunisia, praised as a model for democratic transition since its 2011 revolt ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, has mostly avoided the violent turmoil of other ""Arab Spring"" countries which also toppled long-standing rulers.

But an attack by jihadist gunmen on the Bardo museum in Tunis in March, and a gun attack on foreign tourists at a beach hotel in Sousse resort in June, have left the government struggling to find the best strategy to counter militants.

In a statement Essid's office named Hedi Majdoub as the new interior minister and a former presidential adviser, Khemais Jinaou, as foreign minister.

More than 3,000 Tunisians have left to fight for Islamic State and other groups in Iraq and Syria and increasingly in neighboring Libya. The government has cracked down on militants at home but has faced criticism about how security forces are protecting human rights.

11401573,2016-12-26,"BENGHAZI, Libya Forces loyal to Libya's eastern government said they had carried out an air strike against opponents in the central Jufra region on Monday.

Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), said the strike had targeted a camp used by the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB), a force that the LNA has previously clashed with.

The LNA and the BDB are on opposite sides of a conflict in which two loose and shifting alliances have battled for power in Libya since 2014, aligning themselves with rival governments in Tripoli and the east.

In recent months the LNA, led by Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar, has made military gains in Benghazi and Libya's Oil Crescent region, provoking several attempted counter-attacks by his rivals.

""This was a pre-emptive strike against militias that are mobilising for an attack against the Libyan army,"" Mismari said. There was no immediate comment from the BDB.

Images from the oasis town of Houn posted on local media sites showed thick smoke rising close to residential buildings. No casualties were reported.

The LNA carried out air strikes this month to repel what it said was an attempt to recapture Oil Crescent ports it took control of in September. Shortly afterwards, it launched strikes against opponents at a military base in Jufra.

The strikes have raised fears of a new escalation in Libya's conflict. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has so far failed to reconcile Libya's warring factions.

11401578,2016-05-12,"Cameron made the announcement at the start of a global anti-corruption summit he is hosting in London, but critics said the proposed register may not be enough to make a meaningful impact on the scourge of graft.

The build-up to the event was marred by Cameron being caught on camera describing Nigeria and Afghanistan, which are both taking part, as ""fantastically corrupt"", but he later said that the leaders of both countries were tackling the problem.

""We are making some real progress at this summit,"" Cameron told a plenary session to open the event.

""Crucially, there are country-by-country commitments ... to tackle the issues of corruption that people will be able to check up on and report back on,"" he said.

Cameron put tackling corruption, including tax avoidance, at the heart of his agenda when he hosted a summit of the Group of Eight leading industrialized democracies in 2013.

He has sought to present the summit, which brings together leaders such as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and a deputy foreign minister from Russia, as a milestone in that campaign.

Under the new arrangement announced on Thursday, any foreign company that wants to buy property in Britain or bid for a central government contract would have to join the new register of beneficial ownership.

The register, which London said would be the first of its kind in the world, will include companies that already own property in Britain, not just those wishing to buy.

The aim is to expose individuals who hide behind shell companies with obscure names to own properties, a particularly acute problem in London's luxury real estate sector.

The capital has been hit by repeated scandals involving luxury homes owned by corrupt politicians from countries such as Nigeria or Libya.

The release of the ""Panama Papers"", leaked documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca that named many British businessmen and politicians among the list of clients, put tax avoidance at the top of the global agenda.

Some critics said they doubted that Britain's new register would make much impact unless overseas tax havens cooperated by also making public the names of those who own companies.

""The devil will lie in the detail,"" said Margaret Hodge, a member of parliament from the opposition Labour Party who has specialized in the issue of tax evasion.

""I can't tell until I've seen the detail whether this is a PR stunt or a serious policy which will reveal the true ownership of properties here in the UK,"" she told Reuters.

Hodge said she was concerned that the British Virgin Islands and other tax havens under ultimate British control were not present at the summit, and that until such territories also had public registers of beneficial owners the problem would remain.

Britain has acted in the past to impose bans on capital punishment and on anti-gay discrimination on its overseas territories, and Hodge said that if it chose to do so the government could do much more to force tax havens to open up.",Reuters,energy,,"['London', 'United Kingdom', 'Nigeria', 'Russia', 'Afghanistan', 'Libya', 'British Virgin Islands']",Britain pledges to fight graft by revealing who owns properties,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-taxavoidance-britain-idUSKCN0Y3183,None,
11401579,2016-03-09,"* Hardliners keeping up resistance to unity government

TRIPOLI, March 9 Five years after the uprising that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, Tripoli is on edge, somewhere between peace and war.

There is a semblance of normal life in the Libyan capital and glimpses of the unexpected - kite surfers zip across choppy waves and a group of amateur cyclists in matching kit pedal along a seafront highway.

Yet the armed groups that control the city are an unsettling presence. Gunmen in balaclavas staff checkpoints on key roads, and armed brigades have been flexing their muscles in late-night parades.

It is here that a unity government nominated abroad under a U.N.-backed plan is hoping to set up shop.

But two months after the deal was signed with limited Libyan support, Reuters interviews with residents and officials, and a string of recent incidents, show that resistance from hardliners in both Tripoli and the east is still getting traction, shrinking the space for the plan to succeed.

The hardliners in Tripoli present themselves as the true guardians of the uprising, protecting Libya against a counter-revolution and foreign meddling. Those in the east claim to be saving the country from Islamist extremism.

Both speak for some of the armed factions that hold real power in Libya, and are scared of losing influence, protection and access to the country's rapidly dwindling financial resources in a political transition.

In Tripoli's Martyrs' Square, where families stroll past dozens of men saying prayers at sunset, some support the unity government, saying they are fed up with violence, cash shortages and rising prices.

""We've had enough,"" said Fardous Boukhatwa, whose family was displaced by fighting in Benghazi and was visiting Tripoli with three of her children. ""There is only one solution - reconciliation and forgiveness.""

But others echo the criticism of the Tripoli hardliners. ""The United Nations did not play the role of mediator, it was biased towards the east,"" said Abdulkarim Sadiq, a retired teacher from the suburb of Janzour. ""They cannot bring peace to Libya - they just add fuel to the fire.""

A group of teenage boys mention photos they saw on Facebook of Prime Minister-designate Fayez Seraj meeting the commander of Libya's eastern military forces, Khalifa Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally deeply mistrusted in the west.

For nearly two years, Tripoli has been under the control of armed factions that formed an alliance known as Libya Dawn to seize control of the capital.

They reinstated the old parliament, the General National Congress (GNC), and the newly elected chamber moved east to Tobruk.

The Dawn alliance has now splintered. Key brigades have said they will provide security for the unity government, but the situation is volatile.

Under the U.N.-backed plan, the GNC is meant to form a consultative chamber, and a few dozen moderates have been holding meetings in preparation.

After their third session was disrupted by protesters last week, one of those attending, Bilqasem Eggzait, said they might have to consider meeting in a different city.

The same day, a group that regularly protests against the unity government in Martyrs' Square appeared on a popular TV station to proclaim the unity government ""illegal"" and warn of ""bloodshed and a fire of sedition"" in the capital.

Early on Friday, the man nominated to head the State Council said rocket-propelled grenades were fired at his Tripoli office. The U.N. envoy to Libya swiftly condemned the incident, though the property later appeared undamaged.

On Sunday, three members of the committee tasked with preparing security in Tripoli for the new government were briefly detained, drawing further U.N. condemnation.

The chances of major clashes if the unity government came to Tripoli were small because a majority of Libyans support it, said Eggzait.

But with a unified security force to build and oil revenues at a fraction of their former value, the government would need to cut salaries for brigades of former rebels who added tens of thousands of men to the state payroll after the revolution, and this would be difficult. ""Politics in Tripoli is not about ideology, it's about money,"" he said.

While recent violence in Tripoli has been limited to occasional gunfights and isolated clashes, Benghazi, Libya's second city, has been a battleground for Haftar's forces and a collection of armed groups including Islamic State.

After previous promises to ""liberate"" the city came to nothing, over the past two weeks the military has taken control of several key areas, allowing some residents to return to their homes and start repairing war-torn streets.

In the recently secured neighbourhood of Laithi, 42-year-old father of four Khairy Mohamed al-Qatrani said he had been able to return to his house ""thanks to Khalifa Haftar, whose Karama (Dignity) operation has thwarted the plans of Islamic State to take control of Benghazi"".

Qatrani said he hoped the army would be a neutral force in the future, but the military deadlock was broken as Haftar's allies in the eastern parliament, the House of Representatives (HOR), continued to block approval of the unity government, which includes Mahdi al-Bargathi, a Haftar rival, as defence minister.

The recent military push ""very much has to do with Haftar's need to reassert himself as the saviour of the east in the face of challenges within his own camp,"" said Issandr El Amrani, North Africa director for International Crisis Group.

A majority of HOR members signed a declaration of support for the new government, but complained that hardliners had resorted to threats and physical force to prevent a vote.

A ""crisis of trust"" in the Tobruk chamber meant that voting to approve the government there had become impossible, lawmaker Ayman al-Nasr told Reuters.

Western diplomats, who say they can only provide sustained support for the fight against Islamic State in Libya at the request of a unity government, have looked on with growing exasperation.

The extremist group is in control of Gaddafi's home town of Sirte and has expanded to several other cities. This year it has launched a series of attacks on facilities in Libya's coastal ""oil crescent"".

Diplomats may now have to accept a return to negotiations, which could be complicated by the military advances in Benghazi and Haftar's enduring popularity.

Critics of the unity government plan say it was pushed through prematurely, before Libya's powerful armed factions were brought on board.

Unless this happens, with help from the regional powers that have backed both sides - Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in the east, Turkey and Qatar in the west - Libya's conflict will not be resolved, said Amrani.

""The political guys who stand in as proxies cannot negotiate for them at the end of the day,"" he said.

11401654,2016-11-21,"One black market currency trader told Reuters that $1 was buying more than 6.5 dinars in Tripoli on Monday, having passed 6 dinars for the first time in recent days. The official rate is 1.4 dinars to the dollar.

The widening black market premium is seen as a sign of the erosion of confidence in the Government of National Accord (GNA), which has struggled to make an impact since arriving in Tripoli in March.

Power brokers in Libya's east have withheld their support from the GNA while frustration in the west has built over the government's inability to deal with chronic insecurity, collapsing public services, steep inflation and a liquidity crisis.

The government is struggling to overcome five years of turmoil since the overthrow of former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 led to competing power bases and allowed Islamic State militants to take over pockets of the country.

Some ministers have not taken up their posts and the GNA's leadership, or Presidential Council, has been at loggerheads with the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) over the disbursement of public funds and economic policy.

At a meeting in Rome last week, the council set itself a deadline of Dec. 1 to decide on a package of decisions to address the economic crisis, with the council and central bank pledging to ""continue to co-operate on steps to support the Libyan dinar"".

The CBL agreed late last month to make 8.6 billion dinars ($6 billion) available to the council, and the Rome meeting was attended by a newly named deputy finance minister who is meant to smooth the release of funding.. The council is expected to agree an emergency budget for 2017 within a month.

But the mechanics and approval of expenditure have been hard to negotiate, and the CBL and the council remain split over devaluing the dinar and cutting subsidies to reduce Libya's deficit, according to diplomats briefed on discussions.

""There's full recognition that devaluation is a necessary step on the way to economic recovery,"" said one Western diplomat. ""There are two questions, one is timing and the second is who's going to take the rap.""

Further complicating the situation are splits within the council, whose nine members were selected in an attempt to unite factions that had backed rival governments in Tripoli and the east since 2014.

Those associated with factions based in eastern Libya have criticised recent international efforts to mediate the crisis and Fathi al-Majbari, the council member who has held the financial brief, refused to take part in the Rome gathering or a previous meeting in London.

OPEC member Libya is highly dependent on oil sales, but reduced output and falling prices have slashed revenues to a fraction of former levels. Oil production has recently doubled to about 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), but remains well below a high of 1.6 million bpd.

The country remains beset by insecurity, including in Tripoli, where rival militias that have retained power on the ground have been involved in fresh skirmishes since Friday.

11401655,2016-11-15,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, November 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed National Bank of Bahrain's (NBB) and BBK B.S.C.'s (BBK) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BB+'. Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term IDRs of Arab Banking Corporation's (ABC) at 'BBB-', Ahli United Bank B.S.C. (AUB) at 'BBB+' and Gulf International Bank (GIB) at 'A-'. The Outlooks on the banks' Long-Term IDRs are Stable except GIB's which is Negative. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The Long-Term IDRs of NBB and BBK are driven by their standalone strength, as reflected in their Viability Ratings (VRs). Their Support Ratings (SRs) and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) reflect Fitch's expectation of a moderate probability of support from the Bahraini authorities, if required. Our view of support is based on the banks' systemic importance as major retail and corporate banks in Bahrain, and the Bahraini authorities' high propensity to support domestic commercial banks, albeit with a weakening ability to do so. The Bahraini government holds significant stakes in both banks - 32% at BBK and via Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co (the investment arm of the Government of Bahrain) 44.2% in NBB - which is also a factor in Fitch's view on sovereign support. Although the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) regulates all licenced banks in Bahrain, Fitch does not factor any Bahraini sovereign support in the ratings of the wholesale banks, GIB and ABC. GIB's IDRs and SR are driven by Fitch's expectation of an extremely high probability of support from the bank's longstanding majority shareholder, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (AA-/Negative; 97.2% stake), despite the bank being licenced and headquartered in Bahrain. Our view of support is driven by the bank's ownership and a demonstrated strong record of support from the shareholder, and is the main reason GIB's Long-Term IDR is currently in line with that of the smaller Saudi-domiciled banks. The ratings of GIB are not constrained by the Bahrain Country Ceiling of 'BBB+', reflecting the bank's wholesale banking licence, its primarily US dollar-based balance sheet and offshore banking business with minimal exposure to Bahrain (both assets and liabilities), and our view that it would therefore not be subject to Bahraini convertibility risks. ABC's Long-Term IDR is driven by the bank's standalone strength, as reflected by the VR. Its SR is driven by potential institutional support from one of its founding shareholders, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA). Although the other founding shareholder, the Central Bank of Libya (CBL), has historically been supportive of ABC, its ability to provide support and timeliness of support cannot be relied upon. AUB's IDR and SR reflect the high probability of institutional support from the bank's core shareholder, the Public Institute for Social Security (PIFSS), an arm of the State of Kuwait (AA/Stable), which holds an 18.7% stake. The strong links between PIFSS and AUB include PIFSS's strong interest as shareholder in both AUB and its Kuwaiti subsidiary (13% stake). However, support from PIFSS is constrained by Bahrain's Country Ceiling and the Stable Outlook reflects that on the Bahraini sovereign rating. VR The loan books of each of the Fitch-rated Bahraini banks have different geographic risk profiles as a result of their disparate business models and strategies. As wholesale banks, ABC and GIB have limited exposure to Bahrain, despite being headquartered there. The domestic retail banks, BBK and NBB, are more constrained by the local operating environment. AUB is geographically diversified, with significant operations in Kuwait and elsewhere in the Middle East and the UK, with Bahrain onshore operations contributing only around 13% of AUB's profit. NBB's VR reflects the bank's solid capitalisation, although we view the high capital ratios as appropriate in the context of a weakening operating environment, lower risk-weighted assets due to high government exposure and a concentrated balance sheet. The rating also reflects the bank's strong domestic franchise, consistent and solid profitability, generally adequate asset quality despite a fairly high headline impaired loan ratio, and sound liquidity. It also factors in NBB's reliance on a small and competitive domestic environment and concentrations in both loans and deposits, which although comparing well with GCC peers, still give rise to event risk. BBK's VR is supported by the bank's satisfactory and resilient financial performance, despite the weakening operating environment in Bahrain. It has maintained solid margins and consistent profitability through its well-established franchise. Funding and liquidity indicators remain satisfactory and are important rating drivers. Asset quality metrics are sound. However, the VR also reflects the bank's loan book concentration, which while well below the levels of peers still gives rise to event risk. We also take into account the bank's dependence on the undiversified Bahraini market. In light of the weakening operating environment, Fitch views capital as only adequate, despite capital-raising in 2Q16. AUB's VR reflects the bank's diversified franchise, with operations across the GCC, specifically in Kuwait, sound asset quality despite exposure to the higher-risk Middle East/North Africa (MENA) markets, such as Egypt, and solid operating profitability. Risk appetite is conservative compared with many peers in the region and asset quality metrics are consistently sound and compare well with peers. The VR also takes into account loan book concentrations, which however is somewhat mitigated at group level by geographic and sector diversification. The rating also reflects capitalisation ratios that although adequate for the bank's operations, are low compared with domestic and regional peers. The VR of ABC factors in its geographic diversification; in particular, its Brazilian subsidiary, Banco ABC Brasil S.A. (BABC: BB+/Negative/bb), which remains a significant contributor to the group's overall profitability despite a weaker operating environment in Brazil. The Brazilian operation provides the bank with diversified earnings but could also expose it to increasing risks outside of its home market. The rating also takes into account ABC's strong capitalisation, while also considering concentrations on both sides of the balance sheet (with lending concentrations significantly lower than those of peers; but high funding concentration) and exposure to volatile markets in the MENA region. Liquidity is sound, but should be viewed in light of the bank's concentrated funding profile. GIB's VR reflects the bank's sound asset quality, comfortable liquidity and solid capitalisation and a somewhat more conservative risk appetite than domestic peers, in Fitch's view. It also factors in GIB's low operating profitability and the execution risks of expanding into retail banking in Saudi Arabia, although Fitch expects GIB will maintain a conservative risk appetite. SENIOR DEBT Senior debt ratings are aligned with the respective banks' IDRs. SUBORDINATED DEBT BBK's and ABC's subordinated debt is rated one notch below the respective banks' Long-Term IDRs, reflecting below-average recoveries. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, SRs AND SRFs NBB's and BBK's Long-Term IDRs would only be downgraded if both their VR and SRF are downgraded. Downside risk to their SRs and SRFs could arise from reduced sovereign propensity or ability to support the largest Bahraini banks. AUB's IDR and SR are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of PIFSS's ability or propensity to provide support or to changes in Bahrain's Country Ceiling. The IDRs would be downgraded if Bahrain's Country Ceiling is revised downwards or if Fitch believes that PIFSS's ability or willingness to support has diminished. GIB's IDRs and SR are sensitive to a reduced willingness or ability of the Saudi authorities to provide support to the bank, although we view the willingness of the Saudi sovereign to provide support to GIB is unlikely to change. The Negative Outlook on GIB's Long-Term IDR mirrors that on the Saudi sovereign. GIB's IDR and SR will be downgraded to 'BBB+' and '2', respectively, in the event of a downgrade by one notch of the Saudi sovereign, reflecting a reduced ability to provide support. As GIB's Long-Term IDR is not constrained by the Bahraini Country Ceiling, it is not sensitive to negative rating action on the Bahraini sovereign. ABC's Long-Term IDR will move in line with the bank's VR. Its SR is sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the ability or willingness of KIA to provide institutional support, if needed. VR Further downside pressure on NBB's and BBK's VRs could arise from a further material worsening of the Bahraini operating environment that is reflected in a downgrade of the sovereign rating. Downside risk to NBB's VR may also arise from further deterioration in asset quality. Downside risk to BBK's VR could also arise if asset quality or capitalisation considerably weakens from current levels. AUB's VR is sensitive to asset quality or liquidity deterioration or if the bank's Fitch core capital (FCC) ratio is severely eroded. Upside is currently limited given concentration in the loan book as well as the uncertain operating environment in Bahrain and elsewhere in the Middle East, notably Egypt. ABC's VR is sensitive to the risk of an escalation of political and social unrest in the bank's markets (Bahrain, Brazil, and MENA generally). A material deterioration in the profitability and asset quality of ABC's Brazilian subsidiary could also have a negative impact on the rating, in light of the subsidiary's significance to group profitability. Downside risk to GIB's VR could arise from a prolonged delay in the bank's new retail strategy becoming profitable and negative developments eroding the bank's healthy capital buffer. These could come, for example, from uncontrolled loan growth, a spike in non-performing loans or rapid expansion into new international investments, none of which are in Fitch's base case assumptions. An upgrade would likely result from improved profitability metrics and tangible evidence that the new expansion strategy is successfully gaining traction. SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT The senior and subordinated debt ratings are sensitive to the same considerations that might affect each of the bank's Long-Term IDRs. The rating actions are as follows: AUB: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Stable Outlook Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'BBB+'/'F2' ABC: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Stable Outlook Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'BBB-' Subordinated debt affirmed at 'BB+' BBK: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Stable Outlook Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'BB+' Subordinated debt affirmed at 'BB' GIB: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'A-'; Negative Outlook Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F2' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-' Support Rating affirmed at '1' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'A-' NBB: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Stable Outlook Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Contact: Primary Analyst Laila Sadek Director +44 20 3530 1308 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analysts Gilbert Hobeika (NBB, BBK, GIB, ABC) Associate Director +44 20 3530 1004 Redmond Ramsdale (AUB) Senior Director Committee Chairperson Eric Dupont Senior Director +33 1 4429 91 31 Media Relations: Elaine Bailey, London, Tel: +44 203 530 1153, Email: elaine.bailey@fitchratings.com.

11401656,2016-11-14,"But the appointments by the Government of National Accord (GNA) are likely to anger powerbrokers in eastern Libya because they have not been approved by a rival parliament based there which does not recognize the authority of the GNA.

The GNA has struggled to secure and disburse funds since it arrived in Tripoli in March, hindering its attempts to end conflict and economic collapse in Libya that set in after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi five years ago.

The GNA leadership, known as the Presidential Council, said in a statement it was appointing Osama Saleh, aligned with eastern factions, as finance minister, and Abubakr al-Jafal as his deputy. It also named deputy ministers for local government and foreign affairs.

The nominations follow an international meeting on Libya in London last month that aimed to mend a dispute between the Presidential Council and the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) and to prevent further financial and political chaos.

Jafal is expected to be a key point of contact between the council and the CBL who can help to get payments signed off and disbursed, according to diplomatic sources briefed on recent negotiations, though it remains unclear exactly how that process will work.

During the London meeting the CBL agreed in principle to make 8.6 billion dinars ($6 billion) available to the council, including 5 billion for public salary payments, 800 million dinars for electricity credits, 600 million dinars for the National Oil Corporation (NOC), Libya's Audit Bureau has said.

Eastern factions, who dismissed the London meeting as a unilateral move, back a rival branch of the CBL based in eastern Libya, though it is the CBL in Tripoli that receives the oil revenues that make up almost all of Libya's income.

Oil production has doubled to around 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) since September after forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar seized several blockaded oil ports and allowed the NOC to reopen them.

But output remains far below the 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing in 2011 and recent production gains are seen as fragile without any political deal.

The GNA, the result of a U.N.-mediated deal signed last December, is supposed to replace rival governments set up in Tripoli and eastern Libya in 2014.

But it has not managed to secure the endorsement of the powerbrokers in the east and has also lost support in western Libya over its inability to resolve a cash crisis and deal with insecurity and failing public services.

A group of mediators convened by the United Nations called last Friday for the eastern parliament to formally adopt the December deal and for the Presidential Council ""to improve its performance to address the stifling security, social and economic problems that face Libyan citizens across the country"".",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'London', 'Tripoli']","Libya's U.N.-backed government appoints finance minister, deputy to unlock funds",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-government-idUSKBN1391BN,None,
11401658,2016-09-13,"TUNIS/BENGHAZI, Libya, Sept 12 Libyan forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar said on Monday they had tightened their control over four major oil ports, casting a Western-backed project to unite Libya and revive oil exports into deep uncertainty.

Haftar's forces met little resistance as they seized the terminals at Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Brega in an operation launched on Sunday, displacing a rival armed faction aligned with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.

The advance is the latest power struggle over the OPEC nation's energy assets, after the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi and the chaos that followed left the North African country splintered into competing rival armed factions.

Haftar opposes the Tripoli government and has resisted its attempts to integrate his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) into unified armed forces. His seizure of the ports risks a response from powerful western brigades allied with the government and a deepening of regional divisions.

But Tripoli may seek a deal with Haftar - similar to the agreement it struck with the armed faction he has displaced - to restart the oil exports it needs to stave off a financial crisis that could paralyse government operations.

Conflict and political disputes have reduced Libya's oil output and exports to a fraction of the level seen before an uprising toppled late dictator Gaddafi five years ago.

In a statement signalling a willingness to get oil flowing, Haftar's LNA said late on Sunday it would secure the ports to ""return operational responsibility to the National Oil Corporation with a guarantee of non-interference by armed forces in operational activities and exports"".

Just a year ago, Libya had two rival governments, one in Tripoli and one in the east, each backed by competing factions of armed brigades and laying claims to the country's oil resources.

A unity deal brokered by the United Nations, signed by rival factions in December despite opposition from hardliners, was meant to end the divide. As a result of the agreement, the GNA arrived in Tripoli in March, backed by Western powers to stabilise a country where lawlessness allowed Islamist militants and migrant smugglers to operate across swathes of territory.

Since then, however, some political and tribal leaders in the east have withheld their support, worried that the new government is a vehicle for opponents in the west. The LNA has strengthened its position, making military gains in and around Benghazi against Islamist-led opponents before taking control of the ports.

Many people in Tripoli and western Libya criticise Haftar as a new dictator in the making, but he has become a political figurehead for many in the east who feel abandoned by the capital.

In seizing the ports, the LNA displaced units of Libya's Petrol Facilities Guard (PFG) led by Ibrahim Jathran, which struck a deal with the GNA in July to end its three-year blockade of the Ras Lanuf, Es Sider and Zueitina terminals.

The LNA took Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, Libya's biggest export terminals, in a dawn operation on Sunday it dubbed ""Swift Lightning"". Clashes broke out in Zueitina, but the LNA said overnight that it had secured that port as well as confirming its control of a fourth port, Brega.

Residents in Zueitina and Brega told Reuters that LNA forces were in control on Monday.

A commander allied to the LNA said an attempted counter-attack at Ras Lanuf by Jathran loyalists had been blocked on Monday. Jathran had lost much local support after switching allegiances to the GNA; there were few casualties during the port seizures as many of his men appeared to have responded to a call from eastern tribal leaders to hand over control peacefully.

Haftar's forces could face a renewed backlash from Islamist-leaning groups in the east as result of the raids, but they have suffered heavy losses in previous battles with the LNA.

His opponents in the western city of Misrata could prove the bigger threat.

Misratan forces are close to finishing a four-month campaign to oust Islamic State from its former North African stronghold of Sirte.

But the campaign has been costly, and Misrata also has to sustain a military presence in several other parts of the west, including Tripoli, where it has provided support for the GNA.

If the LNA retains military control over the terminals, eastern factions it is allied with could make a fresh attempt to export oil independently from the National Oil Company (NOC) in Tripoli.

But previous efforts to do this through the NOC office in Benghazi and funnel money to an eastern branch of Libya's central bank have been blocked by international opposition.

Claudia Gazzini, a Libya expert at International Crisis Group, said it was in Haftar's interests to have a working relationship with the NOC.

""I think this is what he's aiming for - to be the one who reopens the terminals,"" Gazzini said. ""The unexpected outcome is that the terminals could open earlier than expected if there's no military counter attack.""

Still, a deal between the LNA and the state oil body could face stiff political opposition from Haftar's opponents in the GNA's leadership, or Presidential Council, which late on Sunday called the attacks an ""unjustified escalation"" that would prolong conflict in Libya.

The Council consists of nine members who were selected on the basis of Libya's political and geographical divisions and are often divided among themselves.

The return to the Council of Ali Gatrani, a member representing the east who had suspended his membership for months, opens a potential channel to Haftar and his allies in the east as the government seeks to win their backing.

In the past, however, eastern factions have said they will not join the GNA without greater representation, guarantees over the leadership of the military, and the relocation of the NOC to Benghazi - demands they are likely to press with more confidence now.

""The view of the LNA is that, now they are taking control and making advances, they will want to see an improvement in their funding, they will want to see this reflected economically and politically in their benefit,"" said Mohamed Eljarh, an analyst with the Atlantic Council.

In such a scenario, he said, Misrata leaders could refuse to deal with Haftar, adding: ""There we could really see the faultlines for the division of the country.""

11401661,2016-08-12,"Libya's political infighting made it too difficult to conduct business, Bouhadi said in his resignation letter, seen by Reuters.

In October 2014, Bouhadi was appointed head of the fund, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), by authorities in eastern Libya. They had moved to the east to set up a parliament and government after rival factions took control of institutions in the capital, Tripoli.

The appointment put him at odds with AbdulMagid Breish, who was appointed chairman in June 2013 before the split but stepped aside a year later, then claimed to have been reinstated following a decision by the Libyan Court of Appeal.

Breish was not immediately available for comment on Friday.

The dispute has mirrored the split nature of the government following the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Libya's new U.N.-backed unity government, the Government of National Accord (GNA), is struggling to impose its authority on the country since it took charge in March.

GNA Prime Minister Fayez Seraj has faced opposition to unifying split institutions such as the central bank and the LIA from hardline factions in the House of Representatives based in the east.

The LIA is also involved in two law suits against investment banks Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale, seeking to claw back over $3 billion lost in trades carried out under the Gaddafi regime.

Over a third of the fund's assets remain frozen under sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council in 2011 to prevent money being spirited out of the country.

11401665,2016-06-22,"Islamic State militants had been fighting hard to defend the shrinking territory they still control in the residential center of Sirte, said Abdalla Binrasali, a spokesman at the forces' media center in Misrata.

""The resistance was fierce and they were firing with everything they've got, mortars, rockets and rifles,"" he said. ""They fear that if they lose more ground they will be defeated.""

Brigades largely composed of fighters from Misrata launched a campaign to retake Sirte from Islamic State last month. They rapidly recaptured ground west of Sirte at the end of May, but their advance slowed as they closed in on the center of the coastal city.

On Tuesday fighting escalated and the brigades said they had taken control of parts of the ""700"" neighborhood, the broadcasting and electricity company headquarters and a mosque.

The ""700"" neighborhood is strategically important because Islamic State snipers have been positioning themselves on the district's taller buildings.

The brigades based in Misrata are aligned with a U.N.-backed unity government that arrived in Tripoli in March. It is seeking to replace two other rival governments that were set up in Tripoli and the east in 2014, and to unite Libya's many political and armed factions.

Islamic State took advantage of Libya's political turmoil to establish a presence in several of the country's towns and cities from 2014.

It took full control of Sirte, the hometown of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, last year, creating its most significant base outside Syria and Iraq.

11401666,2016-06-11,"TRIPOLI Forces aligned with Libya's unity government said on Friday they had taken control of the port of Sirte, making further gains in Islamic State's North African stronghold.

Brigades largely composed of fighters from Misrata advanced this week to the perimeter of Sirte's city center, after launching a counter attack against Islamic State last month and driving the militant group back along the coastal road between the two cities.

The brigades are part of an operation backed by Libya's U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which arrived in Tripoli in March and has been gradually working to establish its authority.

Western powers see it as the best bet for trying to unite Libya's political and armed factions against Islamic State and for restoring some stability to the oil-rich North African country.

A source from the operations room in Misrata said fighters from the front line in the south of Sirte had looped round to the seafront to capture the port, which lies about 5 km (3 miles) east of the city center.

The brigades have advanced more swiftly than many expected, though their progress has been hampered by suicide bombers, mines and snipers.

Clashes in Sirte on Friday left 11 brigade members dead and 35 wounded, the operations room source said. More than 100 fighters from the GNA-backed brigades have been killed and more than 500 wounded since the campaign to recapture Sirte began in early May.

Islamic State started expanding into Libya in 2014 as the political turmoil and conflict in the country worsened. It took full control of Sirte last year, but has struggled to retain territory or win support elsewhere in Libya.

As the brigades based in Misrata have advanced on Sirte from the west, a separate force that controls some of Libya's key oil terminals and is also aligned with the GNA has pushed Islamic State back from the east. They reached Harawa, a town about 70 km from Sirte, on Thursday.

11401668,2016-06-03,"The separate deliveries have created more confusion in Libya, alongside warnings that efforts by a U.N.-backed government to unite the country and rescue its failing economy could be undermined.

Resolving an acute liquidity crisis is seen as key to the success of the Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been struggling for two months to establish itself in Tripoli and to make its presence felt on the ground.

Residents in the west say they have seen no improvement in their daily lives, while eastern officials have pushed to ease financial difficulties independently, trying unsuccessfully to export their own oil and ordering 4 billion Libyan dinars ($3 billion) of fresh currency supplies.

The GNA is meant to replace two rival governments set up in Tripoli and the east in 2014. The eastern government was recognized internationally, but its attempts to wrest control of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) have been blocked.

""We asked many printing houses to print for us but nobody accepted. That's why we went to the Russians,"" said Ali Jehani, a senior central bank official in the eastern city of Bayda. ""We could not wait any longer because the economic situation was getting worse in the east.""

Libya's economy has been deteriorating rapidly. It used to be one of Africa's wealthiest nations, but conflict and political anarchy after the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi five years ago have wrecked the oil exports that provide nearly all its income.

Revenue from oil sales is down to about 15 percent of its 2013 level, while bloated public wage and import bills led to budget and current account deficits of around 75 percent in 2015, according to the World Bank. Foreign reserves plunged from $108 billion in 2013 to $57 billion by the end of last year.

The value of the Libyan dinar on the black market is about a third of its official rate.

Living standards have tumbled and prices soared, with the cost of bread up fivefold last year alone. Some 1.3 million of Libya's 6.3 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.

Tripoli seems relatively normal, its roads congested and new shops and restaurants even opening in some neighborhoods.

But salary payments have been delayed for months and banks have strictly limited withdrawals, leading to queues that sometimes start forming overnight. Last month there was a stampede at one bank and several people were shot dead by guards.

Economists say there is plenty of money in circulation, but people keep it at home because they have no trust in the banks.

Frustration at the GNA, whose leaders are still operating out of a heavily secured naval base on Tripoli's seafront, has grown as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan approaches.

""The prime minister lied to us - he told us everything would be fine and then he left us."" said Walid Aguileh, a soldier standing in line outside a Tripoli bank. ""What's he doing by the sea while we're here queuing?""

The central bank offices in Tripoli in the west and Bayda in the east both say they are acting neutrally to relieve the crisis, and that their new banknotes will be distributed across the country.

The Bayda office has already delivered some of the 200 million dinars that arrived on Tuesday to eight commercial banks in the east, as well as to southern regions, Jehani said. It is expecting to deliver to western Libya next week and is in ""full cooperation"" with the central bank's issuing department in Tripoli.

The central bank in the capital, which has ordered 1 billion dinars printed in Britain, said a consignment of 112 million dinars that landed on Wednesday would be delivered to ""banks in all Libyan cities, without exception"".

But mistrust runs deep. Jehani said the eastern central bank had been forced to act because over the past 18 months the east had received less than half of what it should have in payments from Tripoli.

The central bank in Tripoli has aligned itself with the GNA, which issued a statement last week saying the distribution of Russian-printed notes could lead to political division, a collapse of the currency, and hyper inflation - though a leaked internal letter later appeared to show the GNA was prepared to accept the move.

Western diplomats are also critical. The U.S. embassy said it shared GNA concerns the Russian-printed banknotes ""would be counterfeit and could undermine confidence"" in Libya's currency and the CBL's ability to manage monetary policy.

""I hope that this issue of money does not lead to the division of the country,"" said Benghazi resident Moataz al Oraibi, who said salaries were unpaid for 4 months. ""But if the situation we're facing continues, the country will be split and we will pay the price.""

A Ben Jawad resident told Reuters that PFG forces had entered the town and were combing the area to secure it. If the PFG can hold Ben Jawad it could prove significant, signaling the start of a new front in the campaign against Islamic State.

The PFG has declared its support for Libya's U.N.-backed unity government. Other brigades that back the government advanced last week to the outskirts of Sirte from the west.

""We launched today's attack to purge and liberate the central region from Daesh (Islamic State), and secure this area under the umbrella of the ministry of defense and the Presidential Council, the Supreme Commander of the Libyan army,"" Hassi said.

The Presidential Council is the unity government's leadership.

Western states hope the unity government, which arrived in Tripoli at the end of March, can resolve Libya's political crisis and bring together armed factions to fight Islamic State.

Islamic State took advantage of the security vacuum in Libya to seize control of Sirte last year, extending its presence along about 250 km (155 miles) of coastline either side of the city.

In January the group announced it had established full control over Ben Jawad, about 150 km east of Sirte. It also attacked the oil terminals of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, a little further east, clashing with the PFG and causing extensive damage.

Libya's unity government is designed to replace two rival administrations, backed by loose alliances of armed brigades, that competed for power from Tripoli, in the west, and from eastern Libya.

But the new government has struggled to win support in the east, where it is still seeking formal backing from the internationally recognized parliament.

Khalifa Haftar, the commander of forces loyal to the eastern government, has so far rejected the Presidential Council and has announced a separate campaign to capture Sirte. His forces have been mobilizing close to PFG-controlled territory, but have not so far moved decisively toward the west.

The PFG is a paramilitary force of several thousand men that was set up to protect oil installations in eastern Libya but has acted independently and been split by internal divisions.

The main PFG commander, Ibrahim Jathran, was previously aligned with eastern factions, before switching his allegiance. Jathran has said he is willing to work with the unity government and reopen oil terminals that the PFG has long blockaded.

The move coincides with a trend toward restrictions on Facebook in countries including China, Uganda and Turkey during politically sensitive times as the 1.6 billion-person social network grows more powerful.

Obama's three-day visit to Vietnam ended on Wednesday. Obama largely focused on normalizing relations with Vietnam. But he also promoted human rights and chided Vietnam about restrictions on political freedoms after critics of its communist-run government were prevented from meeting him.

The Facebook shutdown was part of a stepped-up campaign by the Vietnamese government to limit use of the social network for political protests, activists said in phone interviews.

Facebook was blocked several times earlier this month as street protests erupted over an environmental disaster that resulted in mass fish deaths, the two groups said.

The social media site was also unavailable inside Vietnam ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday as pro-democracy activists called for a boycott, members of the two groups said.

Facebook declined to comment. Vietnamese government officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment submitted via a government website.

Uganda's government blocked Facebook and Twitter Inc in February during presidential elections. In March, after a deadly bombing in Turkey, an Ankara court ordered a ban on access to Facebook and Twitter.

And during the 2011 Arab Spring in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, social networks were repeatedly shut down.

Facebook is often shut down in Vietnam during politically sensitive times, Angelina Huynh, advocacy director for Viet Tan, which has members around the world, including in Vietnam, said in a phone interview.

The Seachance, which had been waiting to load oil for Glencore on behalf of the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation (NOC), was loading 600,000 barrels for shipment to Britain, port and oil officials said.

Exports from Hariga have been blocked since early this month due to a dispute between competing eastern and western branches of the NOC.

The blockage reduced production from the eastern Messla and Sarir fields, lowering Libya's production to around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), a fraction of the 1.6 million bpd the OPEC member country before the toppling of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The heads of the two NOC branches reached an agreement in principle to resume shipments at talks held in Vienna last weekend, but details of the deal were not made public.

If exports resume, Libya could quickly raise its output to more than 300,000 bpd.

The oil dispute is tied up in a broader conflict between rival political and armed factions in Libya. The NOC in Tripoli is working with a new U.N.-backed unity government to try to revive oil production, but its rivals in the east tried last month to export a tanker of oil independently.

After the tanker was blacklisted and forced to return to a western Libyan port, the eastern NOC prevented the Seachance from loading at Hariga.

In a televised statement from the streets of Abu Grain, military spokesman Mohamed al-Gasri said the forces had ""liberated"" the small town and two nearby villages after heavy fighting.

Western powers are counting on the new government to unify Libya's political and armed factions to take on Islamic State. The government arrived in Tripoli in late March and is still trying to establish its authority.

Islamic State gained control over Sirte last year and has built up its most important base outside Syria and Iraq in the Libyan coastal city. However, it has struggled to hold on to territory elsewhere in Libya.

Islamic State militants overran the town of Abu Grain and several villages after staging suicide attacks against checkpoints in the area on May 5.

The unity government then created a new operations room in Misrata, which announced a campaign to recapture Sirte.

Abu Grain is about 140 km (85 miles) west of Sirte and about 100 km south of Misrata.

The operations room said 32 of its forces had been killed and 50 wounded in Wednesday's fighting, according to a brief statement sent to journalists. Seven died in a car bombing in Buayrat al-Hasun, about 90 km west of Sirte.

The advance came a day after military forces retook Abu Grain checkpoint.

They now also control the villages of Abu Najaym and Zamzam, Gasri said.

""We declare the completion of the first stage of al-Bonyan al-Marsous after we pushed the militants of Daesh (Islamic State) back to the outskirts of Sirte,"" he said, referring to the name the operations room gave to the campaign for Sirte.

A report published on Wednesday by campaign group Human Rights Watch found that Islamic State in Sirte had unlawfully executed at least 49 people accused of offences including spying, sorcery, and blasphemy over one year from February 2015.

It quoted a military intelligence officer in Misrata as saying Islamic State had some 1,800 fighters in Sirte and that at least 70 percent of them were foreign.

Some two-thirds of the city's 80,000 residents have fled, the report said.

Islamic State has gained ground in Libya as two rival governments and a range of armed factions battled to control the country in the last two years. But it has also faced resistance from other local armed groups on the ground.

Military spokesman Abdulkarim Sabra said Islamic State had retreated from Derna's 400 neighborhood and al-Fatayeh, 20 km (12 miles) south of the city, and its forces were trying to head toward the militant group's Libyan stronghold of Sirte when they were intercepted.

The military was providing air support for troops, he said. It was not immediately clear if there had been casualties.

Military forces allied to Libya's eastern government have also been involved in heavy fighting in the city of Benghazi where they have taken several neighborhoods from fighters loyal to Islamic State and other groups.

The eastern government was set up after armed opponents took control of the capital, Tripoli, in 2014, and installed a rival administration. Both are backed by alliances of former rebels who once fought together to oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but have slowly turned against each other.

Last month a U.N.-backed unity government arrived in Tripoli, where it has been trying to establish its authority. The West sees the new government as the best chance of ending Libya's political divisions and uniting its armed factions to take on Islamic State.

An EU security presence in Libya, which would not involve soldiers, would be Europe's biggest step in the oil-producing nation since a NATO-backed mission led to the fall of Libya's long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Diplomats said there had yet to be a detailed discussion with the new U.N.-brokered Libyan government in defining what kind of assistance they wanted from the EU, and that it keen to avoid the impression of moving into the country uninvited.

""It is a delicate balance,"" said one senior EU official involved in the plans. ""We need to prepare to help Libya, but we cannot jump the gun.""

Libyan officials with the new unity government were not immediately available for comment on the specific document. But they have said any international security cooperation must be Libyan-led and so far have made no detailed request for aid.

But inviting in foreign military trainers remains a sensitive subject for the new government, who opponents accuse of being a foreign-imposed body with no legitimacy.

Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Seraj will speak to ministers by video conference at the dinner on Monday.

Talks on a possible EU security mission could give momentum to discussions among Italian, French, British and U.S. military planners on whether to send troops to Libya to help protect key installations, government buildings, ports and the airport.

The United States is eager to see Europe, not Washington, take the lead in a region on the continent's doorstep.

The separate mission, which includes France, Italy, Britain and the United States and is known as the Libya International Assistance Mission, has already briefed EU diplomats about how it could have a military role in stabilizing Libya. It may set up a secretariat based in Rome.

Also under consideration is how the EU's so-called ""Sophia"" naval mission operating in international waters near Libya could move into Libyan waters to destroy boats used by people smugglers, catch the traffickers and head off an expected surge in migrants trying to reach Europe by sea from Libya.

While the naval mission has been operating since mid-2015 and has saved more than 8,000 lives, it is unable to move into Libyan waters without a request from the Libyan government and a U.N. Security Council resolution.

The problem has been finding an effective governing authority in Libya to deal with. Libya has been in anarchy for years, with two competing governments based in Tripoli and the far east and a plethora of militias dominating various regions. The new U.N.-backed unity government has yet to stamp its authority in Tripoli, let alone the vast country at large.

Previous training efforts ran into difficulties in 2012 and 2013 when Italy and Turkey started training police and, along with Britain and the United States, planned to build up a force of 8,000 troops. Those programs were hampered by militia infighting and political squabbling among Libyan factions.

EU ministers will also discuss whether Sophia can share information and work more closely with NATO's naval mission in the Aegean, which aims to help Greek and Turkish coastguards tackle people smuggling there and stem the record flows of migrants into the EU via Greece from nearby Turkey.

Libya's U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi has asked the council for a sanctions exemption on the investment authority, to halt billion-dollar losses caused by ineffective management. LIA Chief Executive Officer, AbdulMagid Breish, said the fund's assets were valued at $67 billion in 2012.

The U.N. Security Council unanimously renewed sanctions on Libya on Thursday and requested the new unity government, that emerged from a U.N.-mediated deal signed in December, confirm ""as soon as it exercises sole and effective oversight"" over the LIA, National Oil Corporation and the Central Bank of Libya.

The council said it was important these institutions continued to function for the benefit of all Libyans.

Breish said about half the sovereign wealth fund was invested in illiquid assets, while the rest was invested in equities, funds, cash holdings in foreign currencies and Libyan Dinars, and real estate.

""The LIA assets belong to the Libyan people and should be safeguarded for their benefit until the political situation in Libya is settled and stable,"" Breish said in a statement.

The U.N. resolution took note of Dabbashi's request and ""affirms the Security Council's readiness to consider changes, when appropriate, the asset freeze at the request of the Government of National Accord.""

11401679,2016-03-23,"TRIPOLI The U.N. envoy to Libya said on Wednesday he had been forced to cancel a flight to Tripoli because he had not been granted landing rights by the self-declared government there.

Martin Kobler said he had intended to visit the Libyan capital to ""pave the way"" for a U.N.-backed unity government to move there from Tunis. Fayez Seraj, prime minister of the unity government, said last week that such a move was imminent.

Libya has two sets of rival parliaments and governments, one in Tripoli and one in the east.

A unity government was formed under a plan to end Libya's simmering conflict, but has faced stiff opposition from hardliners on both sides of Libya's political divide.

Earlier this month the unity government called for an immediate transfer of power. But the prime minister in Tripoli, Khalifa Ghwell, warned it not to move, and eastern government said it should first secure a long-delayed vote of approval from the internationally recognized parliament in the east.

Ghwell's office in Tripoli said authorities there had asked Kobler for an agenda for his visit but had not received a reply and therefore had not granted permission for him to land.

Previous requests from Kobler to visit had not been granted for the same reason, it said, adding that the visit had been postponed, not canceled.

In televised comments on Wednesday, Ghwell repeated his criticism of Kobler and the U.N., saying they risked creating ""chaos"".

Seraj has said that his government would be able to move to Tripoli after a security plan was agreed with police and military forces, as well as armed groups.

But the security situation in the Libyan capital remains fickle, and there have been repeated clashes between armed groups.

Overnight, the commander of Tripoli's diplomatic police, Faraj Swaihili, escaped an assassination attempt by an armed group, according to accounts posted by residents on social media. No-one could be reached to confirm the reports.

That followed clashes near a bank in the Bab Ben Ghashir district on Monday, and heavy gunfire between the Zawiyat Addahmani area and Bab Azizziya on Saturday.

Tripoli is controlled by a number of semi-official armed groups which clash periodically, and it was not clear if any of the most recent incidents were linked to political developments.

Some armed groups, including powerful factions from the Western city of Misrata, have said they will back the unity government, but other brigades remain opposed.

The unity government was named under a plan to end the political chaos and conflict that has beset Libya since the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi five years ago.

Since 2014, the country has had two rival parliaments and governments, one based in Tripoli and one in the east.

""We, the government of national accord, will be in the capital Tripoli soon ... within a few days,"" Seraj told Jordan-based Libya HD channel in a pre-recorded interview.

""The armed groups will remain in their camps until an agreement is found with them about whether their members will be integrated and young people absorbed within certain programs according the security plan,"" he said.

The unity government has faced opposition from hardliners on both sides of Libya's political divide, and the prime minister of the government based in Tripoli this week warned the unity government not to move there.

But Western powers have been pushing hard for the unity government to start work, hoping that it will be able to tackle the threat from Islamic State, both by drawing together Libyan armed factions, and by requesting international help.

Seraj said the Presidential Council saw a need to take advantage of the ""international momentum"" around Libya, but it was up to Libyans to determine their needs.

""If the international community provides assistance I do not think the Libyans would reject that, but within the rules and standards, and according to what Libyans want,"" he said.

""Direct intervention is unacceptable, and we have sent that message clearly.""

Both Hassan Bouhadi, appointed by the internationally recognised government based in Tobruk, and AbdulMagid Breish both claim to be rightful chairman of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) - a long-running dispute that mirrors the fragmented nature of the country since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The Tobruk government is challenged by a rival administration backing Breish and based in Tripoli. Both claim rights to the country's resources.

Judge William Blair's decision on the first day of a hearing followed arrival of a letter from the British Foreign Office, which was read out in court, on prospects for establishment of a Government of National Accord under U.N auspices that could effectively end the dispute.

Fayez Serraj, named in the Libya Political Agreement as head of the presidency council, was currently putting together a cabinet of ministers. The leadership of the LIA would be clarified as soon as possible after approval of that cabinet.

""In those circumstances, the court considers that it would be premature today to decide the issues before it,"" said Justice Blair, adjourning the case.

The LIA wants to pursue Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale in the English courts for more than $3 billion it claims was mismanaged. Both banks have rejected the allegations.

Breish welcomed the decision.

""We must not lose sight of the main objective - to return the assets that we believe have been stolen from the Libyan people,"" he said.

Bouhadi said he was optimistic there would soon be an established government of national accord.

11401682,2016-03-04,"Reida El Oakley said there was no money in Libya's health budget for 2016 and urged world powers to release funds frozen abroad, saying a fraction of that money could finance medical care ""for years to come"".

Five years after the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi Libya is struggling with political chaos and conflict, as an internationally recognized government based in the east vies for power with a rival administration in Tripoli.

Benghazi, Libya's second city, has seen frequent street battles since military forces began a campaign against Islamist militants and other armed groups in 2014.

Oakley said there was an urgent need for mobile clinics and trauma kits, as well as basic equipment such as gloves and gauze.

A shortage of blood bags meant people trying to give blood had not been able to, he told journalists in Tunis. ""This is how bad the situation is.""

Many foreign medical staff left more than a year ago, and there was a ""desperate need for doctors and nurses,"" he said. The city has fewer than 700 hospital beds, compared with 3,000 at the start of 2014.

Libya's health budget would normally be about $1 billion, but less than $500 million could cover essential medical needs this year if used prudently, Oakley said.

He said the international community had been waiting for the long-delayed approval of a U.N.-backed unity government to release frozen funds, but that this was the wrong approach and the money could be disbursed transparently through the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO).

""The patients are the ones who are paying the price,"" he said.

11401683,2016-02-05,"The Pentagon has warned in recent weeks of the dangers posed by Islamic State's growth in Libya. The U.S. is developing military options, which were discussed at an inconclusive meeting last week of President Barack Obama and his top security aides, officials said.

Those options include increased air strikes, deploying U.S. special operations forces and training Libyan security forces, officials say.

But the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said enormous hurdles stand in the way of increased American military involvement. The largest is the formation of a unified Libyan government strong enough to call for and accommodate foreign military assistance.

Getting some allies on board could also require a new mandate from the United Nations, they said.

""We're not there yet,"" said one U.S. official. He and other officials with knowledge of internal deliberations cautioned that it is too soon to estimate when military action might begin, but cautioned it could take many weeks or even months.

""As far as I'm aware, there is no clear intention to go ahead with the military-style action. There is a lot of thinking, a lot of thinking, a lot of planning,"" said a Western diplomat.

U.S. and European officials describe Islamic State's presence in Libya as increasingly worrisome, although not on the scale of its rule over swaths of Iraq and Syria.

Islamic State forces have attacked Libya's oil infrastructure and taken control of the city of Sirte, exploiting a power vacuum in the North African country where two rival governments have been battling for supremacy.

Estimates of Islamic State fighters in Libya range from 3,000 to 5,000-6,000. Officials openly worry that the group could use its Libya haven to relieve the pressure from U.S. air strikes and local forces against its home base in Iraq and Syria.

Under a U.N.-backed plan for a political transition, Libya's two warring administrations are expected to form a unity government, but more than a month after the deal was agreed in Morocco, its implementation has been dogged by infighting.

Ben Fishman, a former White House aide under Obama who dealt with Libya policy, said there is concern in the Obama administration that military action now could disrupt the government formation process. It might, he said, prompt moderate forces in Libya to back away.

Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chief of Staff, appeared to reference those concerns last month.

""You want to take decisive military action to check ISIL's expansion and at the same time you want to do it such a way that's supportive of a long-term political process,"" he said.

Still, Fishman said, ""I think we have to do something on the ground soon, because they (Islamic State) are pretty much acting with impunity.""

Forming a unified Libyan government could pave the way toward Tripoli formally requesting greater international assistance.

But with Libya in chaos, it would likely take a new government some time to get on its feet, officials said,

U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said this week that the focus of the international community on Libya is political, not military.

Once a government is in place, ""we have indicated a willingness, along with a number of other countries, to help them secure the country,"" Carter said. He noted that ""the Italians have indicated that they would take the lead in that, rather than the United States, which is fine with us.""

The U.S. military has been laying the groundwork for greater action, sending U.S. special forces into Libya to establish contact with local armed groups to get a better picture of who the international community might be able to work with.

U.S. officials also say the amount of intelligence collection about Islamic State's activities in Libya has also increased in recent weeks.

They also have not ruled out more precision strikes against top Islamic State leaders like one in November in which American F-15 aircraft killed Islamic State's senior leader in Libya, known as Abu Nabil.",Reuters,energy,,[],"Despite Libya urgency, hurdles to quick action against Islamic State",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-libya-idUSKCN0VE2OJ?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews,None,

11401936,2016-12-21,"LONDON OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers have agreed to reduce their combined output by more than 1.7 million barrels per day for six months from January 2017.

But the agreement contains a provision that it can be extended for a further six months, subject to market conditions.

Oil traders are betting on an extension, with most of the rebalancing of the oil market expected to occur in the second half of 2017.

Storage tanks are expected to remain fairly full throughout the first six months of the year and only start emptying from June (tmsnrt.rs/2hcnjbu).

Brent time spreads, the difference between futures prices for different months, provide an insight into how traders expect stocks to behave.

Brent futures prices remain in a contango through the first half of 2017, reflecting the need to cover the costs of storing and financing large volumes of crude (tmsnrt.rs/2i0JU7A).

But the contango starts to narrow significantly around June and disappears entirely by the end of the northern hemisphere summer (tmsnrt.rs/2i0Jiia).

The current structure of futures prices implies it will no longer be necessary or financially viable to store such large volumes of crude from the third quarter onwards.

The futures price curve contains an expectation about the state of supply, demand and the demand for storing oil.

Like any other forecast, the curve can be wrong. The oil market could rebalance faster or slower than currently expected.

For example, traders expected stocks to start drawing down from the middle of 2016, and instead they continued to increase.

But the curve does provide the best indication that we have about the expected timescale for rebalancing and stock draws.

The curve implies a modest drawdown in stocks is expected during the first half and then a much faster drawdown in the second. The expectations appear reasonable.

The oil market will start 2017 with a high level of inventories inherited from 2016 thanks to recent increases in production by both OPEC and non-OPEC countries.

And the end of the first quarter and start of the second is traditionally the weakest time of year for crude demand with many refineries doing maintenance after the winter heating season and before the summer driving season.

But by the middle of the year, U.S. refineries will be ramping up crude processing to meet summer driving demand from motorists.

And Saudi Arabia and Iraq will both be increasing the amount of crude burned in their power plants to meet summer demand for electricity and air-conditioning.

Just as importantly, the underlying demand for crude around the world will continue increasing, provided the global economy avoids a recession, helping tighten the market.

The structure of futures prices implies that OPEC and non-OPEC producers will agree to roll over their output curbs in May and June.

Targets may be modified, and compliance with them may weaken as time goes on, but the oil market's expected shift into a deficit from mid-year implies some degree of production discipline is likely to be maintained.

The principal risks to this forecast are (a) significant non-compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC; (b) a big increase in uncapped Nigerian and Libya production; (c) a global economic slowdown; and (d) a significant increase in U.S. shale production in response to higher prices.

Any of these factors could delay the expected rebalancing yet again. But in their absence, the oil market is expected to move into a significant supply-demand deficit by the middle of 2017 and draw down stocks heavily in the second half.",Reuters,energy,,"['Iraq', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Nigeria', 'Libya']",Brent curve signals oil tanks will start emptying in second half of 2017: Kemp,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-stocks-kemp-idUSKBN14A1NH,None,
11401938,2016-10-31,"The rise in output could add to scepticism about OPEC's ability to finalize a plan agreed in September to limit supplies. Oil, which rallied to a 2016 high near $54 a barrel following the decision, has since slipped toward $48.

Supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has risen to 33.82 million barrels per day (bpd) in October from a revised 33.69 million bpd in September, according to the survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources.

That would be 820,000 bpd above the top end of a target output range OPEC agreed to adopt at a Sept. 28 meeting. According to analysts, production near 34 million bpd would prolong the supply surplus weighing on the market.

""With OPEC production creeping up toward 34 million barrels a day, a production freeze guarantees that the oil market will remain out of balance throughout 2017 and into 2018,"" said David Hufton of oil broker PVM.

Supply has risen since OPEC in 2014 dropped its historic role of fixing output to prop up prices as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran pumped more. Production has also climbed due to the return of Indonesia in 2015 and Gabon in July as members.

October's supply from OPEC excluding Gabon and Indonesia, at 32.88 million bpd, is the highest in Reuters survey records starting in 1997.

In October, the increase was led by Nigeria, Libya and Iraq. Supply in Nigeria, where output had fallen due to militant attacks on oil installations, rose as exports of Qua Iboe and Forcados crude resumed.

In Libya, production has been hit by port shutdowns, strikes and protests since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Output has increased in recent weeks since the reopening of some major terminals, but remains a fraction of the 2011 rate.

Iraq exported more crude from its northern and southern ports, lifting supply to 4.58 million bpd in October from a revised 4.52 million bpd in September, according to the survey. Iraq says its September production is higher.

Saudi Arabia has kept supply steady to lower, but still within sight of the record high reached in the summer, sources in the survey said. One source said there were signs of a bigger drop in output.

Fellow Gulf producers the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait both pumped slightly more. The two say their production is higher than estimated by both the Reuters survey and by the sources that OPEC uses to monitor its output.

Supply growth in Iran, OPEC's fastest source of production increases earlier this year after the lifting of Western sanctions, has slowed down as output nears the pre-sanctions rate. Iran is seeking investment to boost supply further.

Among countries with lower output, the biggest drop was in Angola because of planned maintenance on the Dalia crude stream which pushed exports to a 10-year low.

OPEC's smallest producer Gabon pumped less because of a workers' strike, which cut output for part of the month.

The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

11401939,2016-10-12,"The price of crude oil has stabilized around $50 a barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed the output deal on Sept. 28, but rising production from Libya and Nigeria -- both members of the producer group -- casts doubt over the agreement's effectiveness, the heads of trading firms Gunvor and BB Energy told the Reuters Commodities Summit.

""Clearly, they have put a floor on the market,"" Gunvor Chief Executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said.

""But I don't think they can do any substantial cut. There are too many uncertain factors involved. These two countries (Libya and Nigeria) can wipe out any other deal that has been agreed.""

Any agreed reduction will not affect actual supplies until next year, Tornqvist added, because the next OPEC meeting to set supply policy, in Vienna on Nov. 30, will be too late to adjust cargo loading dates before 2017.

""Realistically, they can't do anything till January. We're going to have quite a lot of oil in the market until then. I don't have high expectations of sustained higher oil prices, certainly for the medium term.""

Glencore's head of oil, Alex Beard, was also skeptical that OPEC's deal is a game changer.

""We need to see the real deal in November rather than the talk of the idea of doing a deal,"" he said.

""Libya's production is certainly going up at the moment and Nigeria is obviously off its lows as well. So I guess my outlook on the OPEC meeting is they've still got their work to do to come up with the detail that will convince the market.""

Gunvor's Tornqvist said the oil market is unlikely to rebalance until the middle or second half of 2017, giving a similar timeframe to that expected by Vitol's chief executive.

Vitol CEO Ian Taylor on Monday said the price of oil in dollars could reach the high fifties to early sixties if OPEC and other producers cut supplies by 1 million barrels per day.

""But can they really give us a million between OPEC and non-OPEC? It's a tough call,"" he said.

The head of BB Energy, Mohamed Bassatne, told the summit on Wednesday that he does not expect a rapid rally or an early rebalancing of supply and demand.

""I do think that the market will probably have found some kind of bottom between $45 and $50,"" he said.

""It probably will go higher, but it still needs time to rebalance ... I don't see it rebalancing until probably second half of 2017.""

11401940,2016-08-31,"* After big post-sanctions rise, no further gain in Iran

* Nigeria posts biggest drop, Libya also pumps less

By Alex Lawler

LONDON, Aug 31 OPEC's oil output is likely in August to reach its highest in recent history, a Reuters survey found on Wednesday, as extra barrels from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf members make up for losses in Nigeria and Libya.

Production in top OPEC exporter Saudi Arabia has likely reached a fresh record, sources in the survey said, as it meets seasonally higher domestic demand and focuses on maintaining market share.

Other big Middle Eastern producers, except Iran, also boosted output.

Supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has risen to 33.50 million barrels per day (bpd) from a revised 33.46 million bpd in July, according to the survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources.

The gain could add to scepticism about renewed OPEC talk of freezing output to support prices. Oil has risen towards $48 a barrel from $42 at the start of August, helped by such speculation, but these hopes have waned in recent days.

""OPEC does not really want to freeze production,"" said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix. ""But it dreams of freezing prices at current levels.""

Supply has risen since OPEC in 2014 dropped its historic role of fixing output to prop up prices as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran pumped more. Production has also climbed due to the return of Indonesia in 2015 and Gabon in July as members.

The membership changes have skewed historical comparisons. August's supply from OPEC excluding Gabon and Indonesia, at 32.54 million bpd, is the highest in Reuters survey records starting in 1997.

In August, Saudi Arabia is expected at least to match July's record of 10.67 million bpd, sources in the survey said. Other industry sources told Reuters a new record as high as 10.90 million bpd was possible in August.

There is no sign of any deliberate cutbacks. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters last week that August production had remained around July's level, without giving a precise figure.

The United Arab Emirates continues to expand output, hitting 3.0 million bpd in August for the first time in the Reuters survey. Iraq and Kuwait pumped slightly more than in July, the survey found.

Supply in Iran, OPEC's fastest source of production growth earlier this year after the lifting of Western sanctions, has held steady this month as output nears the pre-sanctions rate. Iran is seeking investment to boost supply further.

Of countries with lower output, the biggest drop came from Nigeria as militants attacked oil facilities. The Qua Iboe stream, the country's largest, was under force majeure for the whole month, reducing exports.

Libyan output slipped further and another decline occurred in Venezuela, hit by an economic crisis.

Over the past three months officials inspected nearly 700 firms and 16 tourist resorts owned by citizens from the Gulf, Libya, Russia and Ukraine.

About 500 of the firms, between them owning more than 600 residential and business premises, were found to be registered at false addresses and had no staff, the office said.

Many of the property owners had registered the firms as real estate companies for a 2,000 Bosnian mark ($1,000) fee in order to buy or develop property worth hundreds of thousands of marka to rent out to tourists, then not filing tax declarations.

Some of the owners were living illegally in the country, some were not registered as having arrived in the country at all, some had violated their visa requirements and others misused their work permits, the office said.

Depending on the offence, more than 300 will be either asked to leave the country voluntarily or be expelled and banned from returning for between one and five years, a source at the office said.

Details of the violations will be passed on to tax authorities and the police.

11402037,2016-12-02,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, December 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Arap Turk Bankasi A.S.'s (ATB) Long-Term Local and Foreign Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, VR AND NATIONAL RATING The IDRs and National Rating are driven by ATB's standalone strength, as measured by the 'bb-' Viability Rating (VR). The VR reflects ATB's reliance on substantial deposit funding from majority shareholder, Libyan Foreign Bank (LFB), and on trade flows between Libya and Turkey. The ratings also reflect ATB's limited franchise within the Turkish banking sector, the bank's specialist focus on the higher-risk Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and high credit concentrations on- and off-balance sheet. The VR benefits from ATB's track record of consistently healthy financial performance. ATB has developed significant expertise in trade financing between Turkey and MENA countries, in particular Libya. Other activities include correspondent banking with regional counterparties including Libyan banks, as well as cash loans to major Turkish corporates. Transactions with Libya, while higher-risk, have performed well over time. Consequently, ATB's asset quality metrics compare well with Turkish commercial banks and trade finance bank peers as impaired exposures represented a low 0.2% of total business volume (taking total assets and total off-balance sheet activities) at end-3Q16. The main risk to asset quality is from high borrower and geographic concentrations given the bank's small size, customer base and focus. Deposits from LFB represented 53% of ATB's non-equity funding at end-3Q16, presenting significant funding concentration. However, this has been fairly stable over the years and has supported ATB's operations within the region. Other sources of funding consist of bank borrowings (31%), of which a high proportion is from related LFB affiliates, and customer deposits (13%). Management intends to diversify sources of funding to reduce concentrations. ATB's capital adequacy ratios are adequate (Fitch Core Capital/risk-weighted assets of 18.3% at end-9M16), but capital is small in absolute size, especially given ATB's high credit concentrations. Capitalisation is supported by reasonable internal capital generation. However, capital adequacy ratios are vulnerable to an increase in risk-weighted assets from lira depreciation, given ATB's large proportion of foreign currency (FC) assets and, more significantly, a Turkey sovereign downgrade. Performance ratios are satisfactory, despite tough operating conditions. Margins are healthy (net interest margin: 5.1% in 9M16), but are expected to come under pressure as funding costs increase due to the focus on diversification. Integration with LFB group banks and a small branch network of seven help keep cost efficiency stable (cost/income: 39% in 9M16). KEY RATING DRIVERS SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The bank's '5' Support Rating and 'No Floor' Support Rating Floor reflect Fitch's view that support cannot be relied upon either from the Turkish authorities or from the shareholders. Fitch believes that support cannot be relied upon from the Turkish authorities, given ATB's limited systemic importance. Given the uncertain economic and political environment in Libya, LFB's ability to provide support cannot be relied upon despite a track record of past support for the Turkish bank's operations. LFB has over time shown a high propensity to support ATB, underlining the importance of the bank to the former's international strategy. As well as providing low-cost funding, LFB appoints key senior management (including the General Manager) and plays a vital role in introducing business to its Turkish subsidiary. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VR AND NATIONAL RATING The bank's IDRs and National Rating are sensitive to a change in the VR. The bank's VR could be downgraded if ATB's strategic importance to LFB is reduced, through a substantial loss or withdrawal of funding or business, which could happen, for example, as a result of a change in the regime in Libya. An increase in funding or lending concentrations could also result in a downgrade of ratings. However, these scenarios do not represent Fitch's base case. Upside for the ratings is limited given the bank's niche franchise, high reliance on parent funding and exposure to the Libyan market. However, diversification of ATB's funding profile and business model or significant improvements in Libya's operating environment could bring upside. SUPPORT RATING The Support Rating could be upgraded if Fitch considers LFB is able to provide extraordinary support to ATB in case of need. This would be contingent on a more stable regime in Libya while maintaining the importance of ATB to LFB. The rating actions are as follows: Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'BB-'; Stable Outlook Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb-' Support Rating affirmed at '5' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'No Floor' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A+(tur)'; Stable Outlook Contact: Primary Analyst Mahin Dissanayake Director +44 203 530 1618 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London, E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Huseyin Sevinc Analyst +44 203 530 1027 Committee Chairperson Bridget Gandy Managing Director +44 20 3530 1095 Media Relations: Elaine Bailey, London, Tel: +44 203 530 1153, Email: elaine.bailey@fitchratings.com.

LONDON, Oct 12 Glencore is seeking to increase oil trading with Libya, Iran and Iraq to beat what looks to be a much tougher trading environment compared with last year, Glencore's global head of oil Alex Beard told the Reuters Commodities Summit.

Crude trading in places such as Libya or Iraqi Kurdistan have been the cornerstone of trading activities for many trading houses in the past few years, generating good returns when oil majors were hesitant to enter those places.

Beard said Glencore would be seeking to trade more crude from the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran, as well as from Libya and Russia.

""We are currently lifting products from (Iran's) NIOC and private firms and are looking to expand into crude,"" Beard said, adding he was looking into pre-financing Iranian exports.

Glencore's trading divisions have been in the spotlight for the past two years during the commodities price collapse as the company told the market its trading serves as a cushion when the mining division suffers.

After strong oil and coal trading results in 2015, Glencore reported a 47 percent drop in core earnings for the energy trading division in the first half of 2016 to $252 million citing coal hedging writedowns and less positive oil marketing conditions.

But oil trading volumes rose 33 percent to 4.4 million barrels per day, putting Glencore on track to regain the world's No.2 spot among independent traders ahead of Trafigura and behind Vitol this year.

""Volume is not really a metric that we look at,"" Beard said. ""In 2016, you'll see the energy segment not as good as 2015.""

Success in 2015 was attributed to the steep contango market structure, which encourages traders to store crude to resell it at higher prices later, high freight rates and strong refining margins.

""In the first half of 2016, you had certainly the contango element, but declining. Wet freight rates were very poor and getting poorer and refining margins ... were nowhere near as good as the first half of 2015,"" Beard said.

Contango is a market structure when forward prices are higher than prompt prices. It has flattened over the past year after prompt oil prices rose steeply on hopes that OPEC would help rebalance the market quicker while forward prices failed to catch up with that pace due to modest demand growth expectations.

Beard said trading houses had to stay opportunistic, which implies higher risk taking when supplying oil and pre-financing producers or refiners in distress or difficulty.

In Libya, where Glencore reached an exclusive deal with state-owned NOC to take all exports of the Messla and Sarir grades a year ago, volumes are rising.

Production for the two crude streams stands at around 330,000 bpd, Beard said.

""We're very happy with our relationship with NOC and we've been very pleased to support them through some difficult times in the last 12 months and we're open to do more business there.""

Libyan oil production stands at just over 500,000 bpd, more than doubling after a deal last month to reopen key ports in the east of the country.

Going into difficult places in search of higher margins will remain a risky business.

For instance Glencore, and several oil majors and trading houses, are owed over $1 billion by Morocco's Samir refinery, which they supplied with crude and products but failed to receive payments for after the government ordered it into liquidation in 2015.

""Pre-finance has always been a good part of our business... We have seen defaults before and we will see more in the future,"" said Beard, when asked about Samir. He said the firm was still hoping the plant will restart.

Beard also sees rising opportunities for Glencore in the liquefied natural gas trading business in supplying a rapidly growing base of gas end-users.

""The end-users of LNG are increasing in volume and number all of the time. There are more and more, whether it's floating LNG, regas vessels or whether it's gas-fired power stations or new gas distributors in China,"" he said.

11402040,2016-05-30,"TRIPOLI May 30 Turkey's foreign minister said during a visit to Tripoli on Monday that his country hoped to be the first to reopen its embassy in the Libyan capital, following the arrival of a U.N.-backed unity government at the end of March.

Security in Tripoli remains fragile and the unity government's leadership has been operating out of a heavily guarded naval base as it gradually tries to gain control of ministries.

Tunisia and several Western European states including France and Britain said shortly after the unity government's leadership moved to Tripoli that they hoped to reopen their embassies, but no dates have yet been announced.

""God willing, we will be the first country to resume our embassy's work in Tripoli,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, after meeting his Libyan counterpart Mohammed Siyala and Prime Minister Fayez Seraj at the naval base.

He also pledged Turkish support for the government's efforts to restore stability and security to Libya, and said Turkey hoped to boost its economic presence in the North African state.

""Turkish companies are looking forward with determination to continue their work and resume their activities in Libya in the sectors of transport and energy,"" he said.

Libya's oil-dependent economy has been hit hard by conflict and political chaos, with production dropping to about one fifth of the level it stood at before the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.

Most foreign employees working in the oil sector have left the country, and most Western diplomatic staff were evacuated from Tripoli in 2014 amid heavy fighting between rival factions.

As a result of the fighting, Libya's parliament and government moved to the east of the country, whilst a rival set of institutions were set up in the west in Tripoli.

Islamic State militants took advantage of a security vacuum to establish a foothold in Libya, seizing control of the coastal city of Sirte last year.

The unity government is designed to end divisions between the rival political groups and the armed brigades who back them, but it has struggled to win support on the ground.

With its new constitution, free elections and secular history, France's former North African colony has been a target for jihadists looking to upset the young democracy just five years after the overthrow of autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.

""Tunisia is an important symbol because there are few countries in the region to be reasonably optimistic about,"" said a senior French diplomat before the two-day visit by Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.

""The attacks in Ben Guerdan show more than ever why we need to support the Tunisians.""

About 50 militants stormed through Ben Guerdan on the Libyan border on March 9, assaulting army and police posts. That attack reinforced fears that violence is spilling over from Libya, where Islamic State has expanded amid widespread turmoil as two rival governments battle for control.

The clash came after three major militant attacks in 2015, including on at the famous Bardo Museum in Tunis, which officials say were carried out by militants trained in Libya.

France, a major economic partner, has at times come under fire from Tunisians since 2011 for appearing indifferent throughout the transition process.

But it has increasingly supported the country, fearing the growing chaos could derail its political transition.

More than 3,000 Tunisians have left to fight for Islamic State and other jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. Security officials say Tunisians are taking more and more command positions in Islamic State in Libya.

""There is a general concern about the impact of the Libyan crisis on Tunisia. Attack after attack, we see the link with Libya, where we see Tunisians in Libya turning against Tunisia. Access is too easy,"" said a second French official.

In terms of security, Paris is providing intelligence for Tunisia's special forces and implementing a 20 million-euro package aimed at equipping them.

Several dozen French military advisers are also on the ground training them and studying how to boost the number of special forces. However, unlike Britain, Paris is not planning to send advisers to help Tunisians stop border infiltration.

Key to France's support is a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) aid package over 5 years to help Tunisia develop poor regions, stimulate job creation - especially for the youth - and modernize Tunisia's administration, a major hurdle to the disbursement of international aid.

""There is a socio-economic breeding ground on which radicalization is prospering,"" said the diplomat.

""There is a direct link between massive youth unemployment, neglected regions and the fact that Tunisia provides one of the largest contingents of foreign fighters for jihadists.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Tunisia', 'Libya', 'France', 'Paris', 'Tunis', 'Iraq', 'Syria', 'United Kingdom']","Fearing Islamic State spillover, France to push Tunisia aid",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tunisia-france-idUSKCN0WJ01D,None,
11402042,2016-02-28,"BRUSSELS The European Union fears Mediterranean migrant smuggling gangs are reviving a route from Egypt, officials told Reuters, putting thousands of people to sea in recent months as they face problems in Libya and Turkey.

""It's an increasing issue,"" an EU official said of increased activity after a quiet year among smugglers around Alexandria that has raised particular concerns in Europe about Islamist militants from Sinai using the route to reach Greece or Italy.

Departures from Egypt were a tiny part of the million people who arrived in Europe by sea last year; more than 80 percent came from Turkey to Greece and most others from Libya to Italy. Detailed figures on Egypt are not available.

But as security in anarchic Libya has worsened, EU officials say, more smugglers are choosing to bring African and Middle East refugees and migrants to the Egyptian coast.

Voyages from Egypt are long, but smugglers mainly count on people being rescued once in international shipping lanes.

Brussels, engaged in delicate bargaining with Turkey to try and stem the flow of migrants from there, is concerned that the Egyptian authorities are not stopping smugglers. But it is reluctant to use aid and trade ties to pressure Cairo to do more when Egypt remains an ally in an increasingly troubled region.

""Our major concern is that among smugglers and migrants there may also be militants from the Sinai, affiliated to al Qaeda or Islamic State,"" a second EU official said.

""Controls in Egypt are strict, which limit the activities of smugglers ... But sometimes we suspect that they turn a blind eye to let migrants go somewhere else.""

An Egyptian security official told Reuters that Cairo had more pressing concerns, limiting resources to control migrants.

""Human smuggling is on the rise in Egypt,"" he said. ""The authorities are too busy with other issues to deal with this.""

A spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini declined comment.

11402151,2016-11-20,"TRIPOLI At least 16 people died and 50 were wounded in Libya in four days of clashes between rival factions in the southern city of Sabha, a health official said on Sunday.

According to residents and local reports, the latest bout of violence erupted between two tribes after an incident in which a monkey that belonged to a shopkeeper from the Gaddadfa tribe attacked a group of schoolgirls who were passing by.

The monkey pulled off one of the girls' head scarf, leading men from the Awlad Suleiman tribe to retaliate by killing three people from the Gaddadfa tribe as well as the monkey, according to a resident who spoke to Reuters.

City officials could not be reached to confirm the accounts.

""There was an escalation on the second and third days with the use of tanks, mortars and other heavy weapons,"" the resident told Reuters by telephone, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the denigrating security situation.

""There are still sporadic clashes and life is completely shut down in the areas where there has been fighting.""

Like other parts of Libya, Sabha has been periodically plagued by conflict since the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi five years ago splintered the country into warring factions.

In the Sabha region, a hub for migrant and arms smuggling in Libya's often neglected south, militia abuses and the deterioration of living conditions have been especially acute.

The Gaddadfa and the Awlad Suleiman represent the most powerful armed factions in the region.

During the latest clashes, which took place in the city center, initial attempts by tribal leaders to calm the fighting and arrange a ceasefire so that bodies could be recovered had failed, residents said.

By Sunday, Sabha Medical Centre had received the bodies of 16 people killed in the clashes and some 50 wounded, said a spokesman for the center.

""There are women and children among the wounded and some foreigners from sub-Saharan African countries among those killed due to indiscriminate shelling,"" he said.

11402152,2016-11-17,"BENGHAZI, Libya At Benghazi University, graduation pictures shot at a wrecked campus symbolize hope for a return to normality in the city after more than two years of war.

It is a war in which the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) has been slowly prevailing against a coalition of Islamists and former revolutionaries. Its commander, Khalifa Haftar, is gaining political influence, his popularity boosted by the army's advance.

""We can't pursue our studies here but thanks to our army I've been able to return, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be standing here,"" said Amal al-Obeidi, a law graduate. ""The situation will get back to normal and we hold great hope in our army.""

But while the LNA's progress has brought relative calm to parts of Benghazi, continued clashes and bomb attacks have exposed the limits of the army's control and raised questions about its ambitions to dominate Libya's rival factions.

While Obeidi spoke, the rumble of war could still be heard in the besieged district of Ganfouda, less than 2 km (1 mile) to the south. Residents across Benghazi struggle with deteriorating living conditions and critics are alarmed at the spread of military rule in the city where the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi began.

Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally who fell out with him and returned to Libya during the revolution, is the figurehead for one of two loose alliances that began fighting for power in 2014. His rivals in the Islamist-leaning Libya Dawn faction took Tripoli that year but later splintered and largely swung behind the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which moved to the capital in March.

Haftar and an eastern parliament and government that back him have refused to endorse the GNA, becoming more confident as the GNA has struggled. Two months ago, they gained new momentum when the Libyan National Army seized oil ports south-west of Benghazi from a GNA-aligned faction, fuelling speculation that Haftar had western Libya - and Tripoli - in his sights.

Clashes in Benghazi have been contained to two or three areas. Some residents in the center of the port city of 700,000 feel safe for the first time in years, remembering the bombings and assassinations that preceded the May 2014 launch of Haftar's Operation Dignity, his campaign against the Islamists, and the fighting that followed.

New measures include electronic traffic surveillance, car bomb detection squads and female police patrols.

""We have brought security back in more than 90 percent of the city,"" said Saleh Huwaidi, head of Benghazi's security administration. ""We're not denying that there are sleeper cells, but they aren't easily able to activate.""

Such claims have been tested by recent events, however. In the past month two bomb attacks in Benghazi have struck prominent Haftar allies.

Violence has flared between the LNA and its main opponent, the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC). This week at least 20 LNA troops were killed when Haftar launched his latest offensive, which included air strikes over parts of the city.

In Ganfouda, human rights groups estimate that more than 130 families have been trapped for months without access to fresh food by an LNA siege, though the army says it has offered them a chance to leave. When LNA air strikes have hit civilians, the army has accused its opponents of using human shields.

The LNA's real power can be hard to gauge. Supporters say training and organization have improved, but the army's strength depends on complex and shifting local alliances. Analysts attribute its breakthroughs in Benghazi against the BRSC and Islamic State partly to injections of material and intelligence support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and France.

Rumors swirl of counter attacks against the oil ports, Benghazi, and in the city of Derna, close to the Egyptian border, where the LNA is fighting a separate coalition and clashes resumed over recent days.

Wissam Bin Hamid, a BRSC leader who along with others has sought refuge in Tripoli, told Al Jazeera this week that his group's goal remains ""to secure Benghazi ... remove the intimidation against people who live with Haftar's militias, and allow the return of our displaced people and loved ones"".

Rivals accuse the LNA of stoking violence by branding all its opponents as terrorists. But as the LNA's profile has grown in the east, criticizing or even questioning it has become risky. Bloggers and activists fear reprisals, and execution style killings have occurred in neighborhoods taken by the army.

The LNA has replaced municipal councils with military governors in Benghazi and at least seven other towns and cities, a move it says is necessary to restore order and bring back services. As elsewhere in Libya, those have been ruined by years of conflict and political turmoil.

But taking on a bigger role also carries a risk for Haftar and the army, said Mohamed Eljarh, an Atlantic Council analyst based in eastern Libya.

""I don't know how they will manage to respond to the needs of the people, and they will increasingly be blamed for any shortcomings,"" he said. After the recent bombings, ""people are saying, 'hey, LNA where are you?'""",Reuters,energy,,"['Benghazi', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Derna, Libya', 'France', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates']","Army on rise in Libya's east, spurring hopes of normal life",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-benghazi-idUSKBN13C1HR,None,

This is what the streets of Sirte in Libya look like, after days of ground fighting and U.S. airstrikes. Libyan forces see these as the final days. They say they are close to ending a six-month campaign to liberate Sirte from Islamic State. U.S. aircraft carried out 36 strikes on Friday and Saturday.

11402155,2016-08-19,"Beaten back by local forces over three months and by U.S. air strikes since Aug. 1, Islamic State is on the verge of losing the city where it exerted absolute control since last year, its most important base outside Syria and Iraq.

But while defeat in Sirte will be a critical blow, it will not be the end of Libya's jihadist threat. Some militants were able to flee Sirte before it was encircled and are likely to try to reactivate elsewhere in Libya, officials and fighters say.

Militants may link up with existing cells and armed factions already operating in other regions, as the divisions that fueled extremism in Libya persist and even risk worsening as a result of the Sirte campaign.

Officials give few details on fighters detained or killed in the battle for Sirte, saying they find it hard to trace militants who use different identities and that resources to track and intercept fugitives are scarce.

But according to Mohamed Gnaidy, a military intelligence official in Misrata, a western Libyan city, about a dozen militant commanders and hundreds of more junior fighters may have slipped away.

""Important leaders escaped from Sirte,"" he said. ""We think there are some in the desert and that they will try to regroup and continue with the same ideology.""

That does not mean Islamic State will resurface openly in another Libyan town, Gnaidy and other officials said. But the group could stage revenge attacks or wage an insurgency, operating sleeper cells in urban areas and forging new alliances in the vast open spaces of the south.

""One of the few things we know for sure is that Islamic State cannot continue acting like a state actor as it has in the past,"" said Marco Arnaboldi, a researcher of political Islam specializing on Libya.

Sirte, the home town of toppled dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the last big city to fall in the 2011 uprising that overthrew him, sits in the center of Libya's coast, midway between areas controlled since 2014 by rival governments in the east and west.

Islamic State seized control of Sirte a year and a half ago as warring factions battled each other across the country.

Much of the group's Libyan force, which according to most estimates prior to the battle in Sirte numbered between 2,000 and 5,000, was based in the port city. At one stage Western officials even suggested Sirte could become a fallback option for the militants under pressure in Syria and Iraq.

But Libya's Islamic State branch, already ousted from its initial base in the eastern city of Derna, has found it hard to win support, raise revenue, and retain territory.

In January, Sirte-based militants pushed eastwards from the 250 km (155 mile) coastal strip under its control, attacking but not holding major oil terminals. In May, they surged on settlements and checkpoints to the west, provoking a counter attack from Misrata to start the campaign for Sirte.

Sirte is now a battlefield, its otherwise deserted central neighborhoods the scene of sporadic sniper exchanges, artillery fire, and house-to-house fighting.

On days of heavy clashes, dozens on both sides have been reported killed. No accurate numbers exist for Islamic State deaths, but casualties among the Misrata-led brigades testify to the enemy's force, with more than 350 killed and 1,500 wounded.

That toll prompted a request for U.S. air strikes, giving fresh impetus to an advance slowed by car bombs, highly trained snipers, and a wide range of improvised explosive devices.

Libyan officials now fear such deadly tactics could be used elsewhere, including in the capital Tripoli and other cities in western Libya where Islamic State previously carried out attacks.

""Now they are trapped and it's easy to defeat them, but after they're defeated they'll definitely take revenge,"" said Fathi Bashagha, a security official who coordinates between Misrata-based forces and the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli.

In the far west, Islamic State could attempt to rebuild around Sabratha, an area used as a training and support hub by Tunisian militants before dozens were killed in a U.S. air strike in February and in later clashes with local forces.

According to a U.N. report published last month, some fighters crossed back to Tunisia following the strike; others found refuge in Sabratha itself or at the foot of the Nafusa mountains to the south. Islamic State ""still operates in the region stretching between Tripoli and the Tunisian border, especially in rural areas,"" the report said.

Within Libya, officials say fugitive fighters from Sirte probably fled south, potentially reinforcing links between Islamic State and militant groups present in the Sahel, including Nigeria's Boko Haram, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al Mourabitoun and Ansar Eddine.

Hassan Kara, a field commander in Sirte, said senior Islamic State commanders had ""fled the battlefield very early on"", and that residents in Libya's southwest had reported militants fleeing through the desert toward Niger.

Arnaboldi, the researcher, said he thought reports of escapes from Sirte may be exaggerated. Fighters who managed to leave told him this was only possible for a short period at the start of the battle.

Last month's U.N. report said Islamic State efforts to infiltrate smuggling networks in Libya's southwest had largely failed. But in the southeast the group ""struck a deal with Arab armed groups around Al Kufra to protect its convoys"", establishing a ""small operational presence"" in the area.

In the northeast, the spillover from Sirte could fuel a conflict between forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, a powerful commander who rejects the government in Tripoli, and loose alliances of fighters that include Islamists loyal to Islamic State and al Qaeda-linked Ansar al Sharia.

Some militants from eastern Libya may have returned to their home region from Sirte. The Misrata brigades that approached Sirte from the west did not manage to seal off routes out of the city to the east until June.

""We heard Daesh (Islamic State) were escaping from this side so we moved to close it off,"" said Ahmed Grayma, a field commander from a Misrata group called Brigade 166 now located on the eastern front.

Haftar's forces have been battling Islamists in the eastern cities of Benghazi and Derna. Though Haftar loyalists have secured large areas in Benghazi, air strikes, bombings and clashes continue in some neighborhoods.

Milad Zway, a spokesman for Haftar's special forces, told Reuters Islamic State had sleeper cells across the east, including in Ajdabiya, close to oil terminals, and Bayda, where the eastern government is located.

Zway said Islamic State and other anti-Haftar militants were ""two sides of the same coin"". Haftar's opponents say he exaggerates the role of Islamic State among his foes, and many are former anti-Gaddafi rebels with no ties to the militants.

The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which nominally commands the Misrata-led brigades, will get a boost from victory in Sirte, but its bid to create unified security forces and end the conflict has faltered.

While the political divides endure, Libya's factions ""could make further use of violent extremist networks in the ongoing political struggle"", the U.N. report said.

11402156,2016-08-18,"On the night of June 2, 2015, gunmen blocked a highway on Libya's northern coast and stopped a white truck speeding toward Tripoli, the capital. The men trained their assault rifles on the driver. Three climbed aboard to search the cargo.

Ruta Fisehaye, a 24-year-old Eritrean, was lying on the bed of the truck's first trailer. Beside her lay 85 Eritrean men and women, one of whom was pregnant. A few dozen Egyptians hid in the second trailer. All shared one dream -- to reach Europe.

The gunmen ordered the migrants off the truck. They separated Muslims from Christians and, then, men from women. They asked those who claimed to be Muslims to recite the Shahada, a pledge to worship only Allah. All of the Egyptians shouted the words in unison.

""There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God.""

""Allahu Akbar,"" the gunmen called back.

Fisehaye realized then that she was in the hands of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Her captors wore robes with beige camouflage print -- clothes she had not seen on other men in Libya. Most of them hid behind black ski masks. A black flag waved from one of their pickup trucks.

""We were certain that they were taking us to our deaths,"" recalled Fisehaye, a Christian who wears a black-thread necklace to symbolize her Orthodox faith. ""We cried in despair.""

Her captors had another end in mind.

As Islamic State battles to expand in Libya, it is rewarding its warriors by exploiting the great exodus of African migrants bound for Europe.

Since the group emerged in Libya in late 2014, some 240,000 migrants and refugees have traversed the war-torn country. Over the past 18 months, Islamic State fighters have abducted at least 540 refugees in six separate ambushes, according to 14 migrants who witnessed the abductions and have since escaped to Europe.

The fighters then enslaved, raped, sold or exchanged at least 63 captive women, nine of whom described their ordeal in detail to Reuters. Their stories comprise the first corroborated account of how Islamic State turns refugee women into sex slaves using them as human currency to attract and reward fighters in Libya. It is the same blueprint of abuse it employed on Yazidi women in Syria and Iraq.

Because of its proximity to southern Europe, and its shared borders with six African nations, Libya is Islamic State's most important outpost outside Syria and Iraq. It is territory that the group is fighting hard to defend.

In August, U.S. fighter jets bombed Sirte -- the stronghold of Islamic State in Libya -- in an attempt to wrench the city from the group's control. The airstrikes have revived a stalled military assault that Libyan brigades launched earlier this summer.

Sirte is strategically important for Islamic State. The city sits on a highway connecting two hubs of Libya's people-smuggling trade -- Ajdabiya in the northeast, where migrants stop to settle fees with smugglers, and fishing ports in the west, where boats depart for Europe every week.

From this bastion, Islamic State has found numerous ways to profit from the refugee crisis, despite the group's declaration that migration is ""a dangerous major sin"" in the September issue of its magazine, ""Dabiq.""

The extremist group has taxed smugglers in exchange for safe passage and has used well-beaten smuggling routes to bring in new fighters, according to Libyan residents interviewed by phone, a senior U.S. official and a U.N. Security Council report published in July.

Brigadier Mohamed Gnaidy, an intelligence officer with local forces mustered by the nearby town of Misrata, says Islamic State has recruited migrants to join its ranks, offering them money and Libyan brides.

It has also extracted human chattel from the stream of refugees passing through its territory, according to the accounts of Fisehaye and the other survivors who were interviewed. Five of six mass kidnappings verified by Reuters took place on a 160-km stretch near Sirte in March, June, July, August and September of last year. The sixth occurred near Libya's border with Sudan this January.

This story is based on interviews with Fisehaye, eight other women enslaved by Islamic State, and five men kidnapped by the group. Reuters spoke to the refugees in three European countries over four months. Two women agreed to speak on the record, risking the stigma that besets survivors of sexual violence. Reuters was unable to reach the Islamic State fighters in Libya or independently corroborate certain aspects of the women's accounts.

Before she left Eritrea, Fisehaye (rhymes with Miss-ha-day) felt trapped in her job as a storekeeper for a government-owned farm. Like most young Eritreans, she was a conscript in the country's long-term national service, which lasts well beyond the 18 months mandated by law. She could hardly get by on her meager wages of $36 a month. But she also felt she could not quit and risk angering the state, which is often accused of human-rights violations.

Fisehaye, a petite woman whose smile easily takes over her entire face, decided to take a risk. In January 2015, she walked across the border into Sudan with a cousin and two friends, her heart set on Europe.

In Khartoum, Sudan's capital, Fisehaye spent four months raising the $1,400 she needed to pay a smuggler for a trip to Libya. She tried and failed to find a lucrative job. So, like thousands of refugees before her, she called on relatives abroad to pitch in. She talked to recent émigrés and found an Eritrean smuggler whose clients gave him a glowing review.

Before setting off into the desert, she heard stories about armed outlaws who rape women in Libya. She paid a doctor for a contraceptive injection that would last for three months.

""Once you leave Eritrea, there is no going back. I did what any woman would do,"" she said.

The first leg of her journey went off without a hitch. In May, her convoy crossed the Sahara and reached Ajdabiya in northeast Libya. Fisehaye believed the worst was behind her. Though no one counts migrants who die from sickness, starvation and violence in the desert, refugee groups say more may perish there than drown in the Mediterranean Sea.

""No one stopped us in the Sahara ... and the smugglers told us we shouldn't worry about Daesh,"" she said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. ""I never expected to see an organized state like theirs in Libya.""

She was wrong.

On the night of the kidnapping, the armed Islamic State fighters ordered Fisehaye and the other Christians back onto the truck. The men climbed onto the front trailer and the women, 22 in all, onto the back. They drove east, threading the same road they had driven hours earlier. A pickup truck with a mounted machine gun trailed close behind.

A half hour later, the truck turned right onto a dirt road and the soft glow of a town's lights shimmered ahead. A few male captives had seen videos of Islamic State beheadings. Realizing the gunmen belonged to the group, the men jumped off and ran into the flat desert. Gunfire erupted. Some fell dead, others were rounded up. A few got away.

""We thought it would be better to get shot than beheaded,"" Hagos Hadgu, one of the men who jumped off the truck, said in an interview in Hållsta, Sweden. He wasn't caught that night and made it to Europe two months later. ""We didn't want to die with our hands and legs bound. Even an animal needs to writhe in the hour of death.""

The fighters deposited the migrants at an abandoned hospital perched in a scrubland near a desert town called Nawfaliyah. They searched the women for jewelry, lifting their sleeves and necklines with a rod, and hauled them into a small room where a Nigerian woman was being kept.

The next morning, one of the fighters' leaders, a man from West Africa, paid the women a visit. He brought a young boy, one of at least seven Eritrean children Islamic State had kidnapped in March, to serve as his translator.

""We are al-dawla al-Islamiyyah,"" the man explained, using the Arabic for Islamic State.

He reminded the women that Islamic State was the group that had slain 30 Eritrean and Ethiopian Christians back in April, filmed the massacre, and posted the video online. The caliphate would spare their lives because they were women, he assured them, but only if they converted to Islam.

""Or we will let you rot here,"" he warned.

Fisehaye found conversion an unholy thought. Along with the other women, she fired a volley of questions at the man: Can we call our families and tell them where we are? Can they pay you a ransom for our freedom? Can you tell us what you did to our brothers? Our husbands?

The man offered few answers and no solace.

Three weeks later, in the first week of Ramadan in June, fighter jets bombed the abandoned hospital compound and some of the buildings collapsed. It is difficult to determine who was behind the attack. Both the U.S. military and western Libyan groups have claimed raids on nearby towns around that time.

In the ensuing chaos, Fisehaye and the other women sprinted past the debris and ran barefoot into the desert. The hot ground seared their feet. The captive men, who had been held in the same compound all along, ran ahead.

Before long, the fleeing captives made out the silhouettes of a pickup truck and men with assault rifles ahead of them. The armed men waved for the migrants to stop then opened fire. The women stopped. Most of the migrant men escaped, but eleven were rounded up and flogged. Their whereabouts are unknown.

The airstrikes continued through the week. Eventually, Islamic State fighters moved the women to the abandoned quarters of a Turkish construction company in Nawfaliyah, two hours away.

The makeshift prison housed graders and dozers from road-work projects of the mid-2000s, their metal bodies rusting under the intense heat. Itinerant workers had scribbled their names and countries on the compound's walls. Fisehaye and the other women stayed in a small room where the drywall sweated when temperatures rose. A Korean family -- a pediatrician, his wife and her brother -- were jailed in another room.

It only took a week for Fisehaye and the other women to attempt another breakout. Nine escaped, but not Fisehaye. Instead, she was brought back to the makeshift prison and whipped for days. The Korean doctor tended to her wounds.

A few weeks later, in early August, 21 other Eritrean women joined Fisehaye's group. They too had been kidnapped along a stretch of highway in central Libya. One woman came with her three children, aged five, seven and eleven.

Throughout the summer, Islamic State consolidated its hold in central Libya. In Sirte, Islamic State fighters crushed a Salafist uprising by executing dissenters and hanging their bodies from lampposts. In Nawfaliyah, they paraded decapitated heads to silence dissent.

Then, in September, the group's emir in Libya, Abul-Mughirah Al-Qahtani (more commonly known as Abu Nabil), advertised his domain's ""great need of every Muslim who can come."" He summoned fighters, doctors, legal experts and administrators who could help him build a functioning state. He levied hefty taxes on businesses and confiscated enemy property, just as his group had done in Syria and Iraq.

The ranks of Islamic State fighters swelled. At its peak, the group may have had 6,000 fighters in Libya, based on the U.S. Army's estimates, although the Pentagon drastically cut that estimate this month to a thousand fighters in Sirte.

The single men, most of whom flocked from other parts of Africa, needed companions, and Islamic State enlisted older women in Sirte to help. The women, called 'crows' because they dressed in black, visited townspeople's homes and registered single girls older than 15 as potential brides, says Brigadier Gnaidy of the Misrata forces.

As the group's ambitions grew that summer, so did its need for women. Islamic State's take on sharia permits men to take sex slaves. The kidnapped women, unprotected and far from home, became easy targets. In mid-August, more than two months after Fisehaye was abducted, Islamic State fighters moved the 36 women in their custody to Harawa, a small town they controlled some 75 kilometers (46 miles) from Sirte.

As Fisehaye and the seven other women Reuters interviewed describe it, life in Harawa was almost quotidian at first.

There were no air strikes, beatings or threats of sexual violence. The captives -- the Eritreans kidnapped in June and August, including Fisehaye, two Nigerians, and the Korean couple and their relative -- lived in a large compound by the town's dam. In the next few weeks, they were joined by 10 Filipino medical workers kidnapped from a hospital in Sirte, a Bangladeshi lecturer taken from a Sirte university, a pregnant Ghanaian captured in Sirte, and an Eritrean woman captured with her 4-year-old son on the highway to Tripoli.

It was here that Fisehaye bonded with Simret Kidane, a 29 year-old who left her three children with her parents in Eritrea to seek a better life in Europe. She was among the women kidnapped in August.

Kidane befriended one of the guards, Hafeezo, a Tunisian mechanic turned jihadist in his early 30s. Hafeezo helped the women navigate their new life in captivity. He brought them groceries and relayed their demands to his superiors in Sirte. He comforted them when they cried. He counseled them to forget their past lives and embrace Islam. That way, he promised, they may be freed to find a husband among the militants. They may even be allowed to call home.

The women asked for religious lessons, and Hafeezo brought them a copy of the Koran translated into their first language, Tigrinya. He also brought a small Dell laptop and a flash drive on which he had uploaded religious texts and lessons on the lives of fallen jihadists.

Fisehaye succumbed first. In September, after three months of captivity, she converted to Islam and took on a Muslim name, Rima. Her conversion had a domino effect across the compound; Kidane and the others followed suit a month later.

""I could see no other way out,"" Fisehaye said. ""Islam was one more step to my freedom. They told us we would have some rights as Muslims.""

After their conversion, Hafeezo brought them black abayas and niqabs, loose garments some Muslim women wear to cover themselves. He kept his distance and refused to make eye contact. Instead, he supervised their piety from afar.

Another guard, an older Sudanese fighter, taught them to pray. He recited verses from the Koran and made the women write down and repeat his words. When the guard moved to a new job in Sirte, Hafeezo brought a flat-screen TV and played them videos of religious lessons and suicide missions. As promised, Hafeezo allowed the women to call their families.

In December, frequent gunfire punctured the relatively quiet life in Harawa. Food became scarce. Hafeezo was often called to the frontline and disappeared for days. One day, he took Kidane aside and told her to prepare for what was to come. The leadership had changed -- Islamic State's emir in Libya had died in a U.S. airstrike a month earlier -- and the women's fate along with it.

""You are now [[i]]sabaya,[[/i]]"" Hafeezo told Kidane, using the archaic term for slave. There were four possible outcomes for her and the other women, he explained. Their respective owners could make them their sex slaves, give them away as gifts, sell them to other militias, or set them free.

""Do not worry about what will happen to you in the hands of men,"" Kidane says Hafeezo told her. ""Concern yourself only with where you stand with Allah.""

Kidane did not share this detail with Fisehaye or the other women, hoping to save them from despair.

Later, one of Hafeezo's superiors came to the compound to take a census. He wrote the women's names and ages on a ledger. He asked them to lift their veils and examined their faces. He returned a week later and took two of the youngest women, aged 15 and 18, with him. On December 17, he sent for Kidane. That day, he gave her to a Libyan member of an Islamic State brigade in Sirte. Despite her repeated pleas, her new owner refused to reunite her with Fisehaye.

Kidane and the teenage women escaped and are now seeking asylum in Germany.

In late January, a stomach ulcer confined Fisehaye to her bed. Stress made matters worse. Returning from a hospital visit one afternoon, she witnessed a child, no older than 9, shoot a man in the town square.

Soon after, she and the remaining female captives moved to a warehouse in Sirte where Islamic State stored appliances, fuel and slaves. A group of 15 Eritrean women, who had been kidnapped in July, and three Ethiopian women kidnapped in January joined them that week.

The warehouse became, to the women, a last frontier of defiance. As new Muslims, they argued for better healthcare and the abolition of their slavery. They absorbed beatings in response.

Resistance proved futile. An Eritrean fighter called Mohamed, who had often dropped by to survey the women, purchased Fisehaye in February. He never said how much he paid for her. But he seemed gentle at first, asking after her waning health and her past life in Eritrea.

""I was confused. I thought he was going to help me. Maybe he had infiltrated Daesh. Maybe he wasn't really one of them. I started harboring hope,"" Fisehaye said.

Instead, he raped her, repeatedly, for weeks.

""No one ever showed us which part of the Koran says they could turn us into slaves,"" Fisehaye said. ""They wanted to destroy us...so much evil in their hearts.""

She plotted her escape but could not find a way out.

Then her owner lent her to another man, a Senegalese fighter. Known by the nom de guerre Abu Hamza, the Senegalese had brought his wife and three children to the Libyan frontline. Fisehaye was to work, unpaid, in Abu Hamza's kitchen.

The work was busy but bearable, until one night in mid-February when Abu Hamza brought an Eritrean woman from the warehouse. He raped the woman all night.

""She was screaming. Screaming. It tore my heart,"" Fisehaye recalled. ""His wife stood by the door and cried.""

The next morning, Fisehaye convinced the battered woman to run away with her. They left the city behind and ran into the desert. No one stopped to help them and they were caught by religious police on patrol outside the city.

The police returned both women to captivity. The battered Eritrean woman went back to Abu Hamza. Mohamed took Fisehaye to a three-story building in Sirte that he shared with two other fighters.

Fisehaye moved in with a 22-year-old Eritrean woman and her 4-year-old son, both of whom belonged to a Tunisian commander named Saleh. Another 23-year-old Eritrean lived down the hall with her 2-year-old son and a daughter to whom she gave birth while in Islamic State custody. That woman and her children belonged to a Nigerian fighter who called himself al-Baghdadi.

Fisehaye's roommates said the men raped them on multiple occasions. They told their stories on condition of anonymity.

""There was no one there to help me. So I kept quiet and took the abuse,"" the Eritrean mother of two later said. ""I stopped resisting. He did as he pleased with me.""

In April of this year, Libya's nascent unity government stationed itself in a naval base in Tripoli. Separately, rival factions -- the Petroleum Facilities Guard in the east and brigades from towns in the west -- plotted to attack Islamic State from opposite flanks.

In Sirte, meanwhile, Fisehaye and her roommates learned that one of them, the mother of two, would soon be sold to another man.

The revelation pushed them to plot an escape. They pretended to call their relatives but talked, instead, to Eritrean smugglers in Tripoli. They studied their captors' schedules. They surveyed their surroundings whenever the Tunisian commander Saleh, in a cruel prank, left the house keys with his slave but took her son with him.

Finally, on the early morning of April 14, the women grabbed 60 Libyan dinars, about $40, from Saleh's bag and broke out of the house through a backdoor. But Sirte looked ominously deserted in the early morning and, fearing they would be caught, the women returned to the house.

They ventured out again, hours later, when the city came to life. They walked for hours before a cab stopped for them. Fisehaye negotiated with the driver in halting Arabic. She told him they were maids who had been swindled by an employer. She gave him a number for an Eritrean smuggler in Tripoli.

The driver negotiated with the smuggler over the phone. He agreed to drive them for 750 dinars ($540), to be covered by the smuggler once the women arrived in Bani Walid, five hours away.

In the end, it took the women 12 hours to get to Bani Walid. As promised, the Eritrean smuggler paid for their escape and took them to a holding cell. There, they shucked off their niqabs and cried with joy. They prayed for the dozens they had left behind.

Fisehaye borrowed the smuggler's phone and called her father in Eritrea. Soon, word of her escape spread among her friends and relatives. They settled her debt and paid the smuggler another $2,000 to get her on a boat to Europe.

In May, during a month when 1,133 refugees drowned at sea, Fisehaye crossed the Mediterranean. Her 10 months of captivity had come to an end.

She traversed a path trod by many refugees, across Italy and Austria, and reached Germany a month after her escape. She is now seeking asylum there.

11402157,2016-02-23,"BENGHAZI, Libya Military forces loyal to Libya's eastern government said on Tuesday they had taken control of two key neighbourhoods in Benghazi, building on gains made against Islamist fighters over the previous three days.

The military said it had full control of the districts of Boatni and Laithi and claimed advances in several other areas. A hospital source said 20 people had been killed and 45 wounded in the latest clashes.

The eastern city of Benghazi has seen some of the worst violence in the conflict that has plagued Libya since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising five years ago.

The violence escalated when military commander Khalifa Haftar launched a campaign in 2014 against Islamists and other armed groups, with the factions taking up entrenched positions in Benghazi's streets.

On Tuesday residents celebrated the army's advances by sounding car horns and setting off fireworks. Some returned to their homes for the first time in months to check for damage.

Haftar's Libyan National Army is loyal to Libya's eastern government, which has received international recognition but is opposed by a rival government based in Tripoli.

A unity government nominated under a United Nations-backed plan is trying to win support within Libya, but its progress has been hindered by political arguments including what role Haftar could have in a future national army.

Libya's eastern parliament rejected an initial unity government line-up last month and has repeatedly delayed voting on a revised proposal, pushing back a vote once again on Tuesday.

Islamist fighters have exploited a security vacuum to expand their presence in Libya, with militants loyal to Islamic State establishing control in the coastal city of Sirte and a presence in several other cities, including Benghazi.

In a separate development on Tuesday, the mayor of the western city of Sabratha said military brigades there had attacked several buildings housing suspected Islamic State militants.

Hussein al-Thwadi said militants at one of the sites had fought back, and that four brigade members had been killed and five injured.

On Friday a U.S. air strike against a suspected Islamic State training camp in Sabratha killed nearly 50 people. Serbia's government said two of its diplomats who were kidnapped in Libya in Benghazi in November also died in the strike.

LONDON, Feb 2 BP on Tuesday reported its worst annual loss in at least 20 years and thousands more job cuts as the British oil and gas company grappled with a collapse in oil prices.

The energy company reported an annual loss of $6.5 billion for 2015, even worse than its 2010 results when it counted the costs of the deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

11402526,2016-08-04,"Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) announced a political breakthrough a few days ago, promising to ramp up production and exports of long-disrupted oil supplies. The NOC said that exports could jump from 300,000 barrels per day to 900,000 barrels per day by the end of the year. If that came to pass it would be very bearish for international oil prices.

But very few people are buying such a scenario. Bloomberg surveyed six oil traders and found zero confidence in a return of Libyan oil from their responses. Three of the six traders said no new shipments would leave Libya's newly opened ports in the next few months. Two others said the deal would break down. And the last said that even if some new exports started up, it would be in trivial amounts.

Citigroup backed up that sentiment in an August 2 report, calling the new announcement from Libya's NOC just ""another headfake."" Libya has promised several times to bring oil back, issuing declarations that oil ports would open and exports would resume. But there isn't a single political entity that has the sway to make all of the country's parts move in the same direction. Libya ""has devolved into a genuine failed state, run by competing militias, and moving a state from the failed to the not failed column does not happen overnight or over months. It takes years,"" Citi analysts wrote.

That means that the promised return of 600,000 barrels per day from the North African OPEC member before the end 2016 probably won't happen. Along with the outages in Nigeria, which Citi expects to persist, the supply disruptions that helped spur the oil price rally in the second quarter could remain in effect for quite some time. That provides a glimmer of hope for a rebound in oil prices.

Oil markets are still oversupplied and suffering from record levels of inventories, a glut of refined products and crude oil that have pushed oil into bear market territory once again.

11402527,2016-07-29,"TRIPOLI--Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC) chairman Mustafa Sanalla has protested to the U.N. envoy to Libya Martin Kobler over a deal struck with militia strongman and Petrol Facilities Guards (PFG) head Ibrahim Jadran to resume Libyan oil exports through the key terminals of Ras Lanuf, Es Sider and Zueitina.

In a letter obtained by Oilprice.com, Sanalla describes the deal as a big mistake that essentially rewards Jadran for his blockade of Libyan oil exports for three years, which resulted in US$100 billion in losses to the Libyan government.

UN envoy Kobler flew to Ras Lanuf on 21 July to meet with the controversial PFG leader, after which the two announced in a joint press conference that oil exports would now be resumed through the ports.

Immediately after the deal was announced, tribes in control of the inland areas where Libya's eastern oil fields are located balked, with the eastern Supreme Council moving to distance itself from any deal made with Jadran's PFG militia.

The Council stated that it fully recognized only the Libyan House of Representatives (HoR) and its military leadership, commanded by General Khalifa Haftar, who is already in control of the key eastern oilfields, including Al-Bahi and Dahra (operated by Waha Oil Co.); Zala, Intisar and Sabah (operated by Zueitina Oil Co.); and the Al-Mabrok field (operated by Total SA), among others.

Sanalla has warned of the negative consequences of the deal with Jadran for the legitimacy of the Presidency Council (PC), which is backed by the UN. The end result is that the PFG, which is basically a militia, will be fully funded and empowered to control Libya's oil and has won this position by holding the country's output hostage for three years through the blockade of the export terminals.

The deal cut with Jadran will create further instability in Libya as Sanalla threatens to withdraw his recognition of the Presidency Council.

According to Sanalla, the PC should financially assist the legal institution belonging to the NOC rather than financially assisting militias.

""The NOC delivers all oil income to the Central Bank of Libya as its institutions are paid through the Finance Ministry, as any other governmental board,"" he noted in the letter.

By making this point, Sanalla was referring in part to the struggle going in with the Arabic Gulf Oil Co (AGOCO)., which is suffering from financial hardship to the point that it may be forced to halt operations entirely at the the Sarir and Masela oilfields. Already there is talk that 100,000 barrels of daily production will be frozen at Sarir due to lack of income from production amid a long-running port blockade.

The media office manager of AGOCO Osama Al-Aribihas told Oilprice.com that the company has held a number of meetings recently to find ways to reduce expenses to a minimum to keep it afloat. In normal circumstances, AGOCO can produce 350,000 barrels per day, exported through the far eastern Hariga port.

The Hariga port was shut down for several days recently by armed men protesting over unpaid salaries.

Sanalla mentioned this incident in his letter to Kobler as well, warning that many armed factions will now take cue from Jadran's success in using militia tactics to force a deal with the new government -- and Libya has plenty of militias who will certainly be watching closely and making plans to hijack Libya's oil.

Funding and emboldening militias to liberate Libya's oil will backfire before those who want their hands on it have time to solidify their control.

Not a day passes without OPEC making oil and gas headlines, and today is surely no exception. Seemingly in lockstep with OPEC, the market is once again pacified on the promise that changes to the global oil supply glut are a' comin'.

Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources close to the matter who had it on good authority that the Saudi's were willing to cut ""up to"" 400,000 barrels per day (and that they had planned to do so all along, with or without an OPEC agreement). We can assume this figure is off August or September levels, which are near-record highs for the oil-rich country.

Of course, there are 400,000 different possible production cut figures included in this ""up to 400,000"" range -- including a big fat zero -- so fundamentally speaking, like so much of the OPEC speak, this could mean nothing.

But this isn't the first time OPEC chatter or supposition or guesswork has moved markets, and it won't be the last. Because, as Oilprice contributor Rakesh Upadhyay pointed out back in August, just a month before the freeze was announced, fundamentals aren't what's driving the oil market -- speculation is. And nothing feeds speculators like OPEC.

As Upadhyay wrote, ""Though most analysts agreed that a production freeze was not going to alter the fundamentals, prices rose sharply, with the hedge funds adding record long positions,"" as evidenced by the chart below, which shows what happened in February when OPEC cuts were on the table for Doha. Fundamentals didn't change -- the glut wasn't easing -- yet hedge funds and speculation on OPEC rumors drove up prices.

The hope quickly faded when the Doha meeting fell short of expectations, but prices continued to climb. Then, the market found new hope in the Vienna meeting. We then wondered -- this time quite wistfully -- if a freeze could... maybe, possibly... happen in that meeting over the summer, much in the same way one might hold onto hope that we might someday win the lotto. Our hopes were dashed yet again -- but not before the market reflexively inched up again.

Soon after, Saudi comments, which indicated that a new spirit of cooperation among OPEC members might be taking shape, sending prices upward yet again. An unofficial meeting was announced. Algiers, they said. ""Stabilize the market"" they said (which can apparently be done with talk, rather than production cuts). Russia chimed in, vacillating between joining the ""market stabilization"" efforts and not. We asked ourselves, this time ever more cautiously, dare we hope again? Most thought not, but speculators threw caution to the wind, moving markets this way and that on almost a daily basis in response to every utterance regarding the freeze.

Related: The OPEC Deal Represents A Permanent Shift In Oil Markets

Then the announcement came that OPEC had reached a deal. The earth shook, moving markets again -- this time by a large percentage -- and this time backed up by a more tangible hope.

Meanwhile, the industry scrambled to make sense of what it all meant. How big would the cut be? Which members would do the cutting? How did Saudi Arabia and Iran reach any kind of consensus when they were worlds apart -- on multiple fronts? And then there was the ultimate question that had every analyst from here to Venezuela furiously figuring and calculating and refiguring and recalculating: just how high could prices go?

Speculators continued to largely disregard the ins and outs of the deal, which were absent at the time, and we saw markets tick up happily in response.

When the size of the production cut -- between 240,000 and 740,000 barrels per day -- was announced, one could feel the weight of the disappointment within the industry overall. The analysts wanted more; wanted deeper. Most OPEC members had been scrambling to reach record high oil production leading up to the meeting, some successful. Given current production levels, the small cut was seen by most analysts as a mere token gesture that would do very little to address what most would agree is the reason behind the price ""problem"" -- the global supply glut.

And further skepticism surfaced over the fact that no specific member had agreed to any specific cut -- they just agreed that as a group, ""they"" would do some cutting -- some months down the road -- and that the ""they"" in that equation wouldn't be Iran. And it wouldn't be Nigeria. And it wouldn't be Libya.

And still, amid all this ambiguity and mystery, and with some distant promise to shave a mere 240,000 barrels of oil per day off OPEC's record production figures, oil climbed above $50 a barrel. Today, Brent is trading at $52.64, which is a 12-month high -- a monumental swing on mere talk.

And sure, some minor fundamentals have changed, such as five weeks of crude oil inventory draws in the U.S., but those inventory numbers are still way too high. In reality, OPEC hasn't actually done anything to ease the glut. They've just talked... about talking... two months from now. In fact, the only actions that OPEC has taken is to pump oil at record paces, adding to the glut, and hoping that speculators will lap up what they're dishing out in rhetoric. That's what OPEC is doing today.

So happy are the markets on this wispy nothingness, in fact, that some are suggesting the oil markets are poised for a major meltdown, as speculators buy up contracts that are equal to a year's worth of U.S. consumption -- amounts that can't possibly be delivered and will be pushed off to next month's contracts or cancelled. To put this in perspective, there are 480 million barrels of oil on order for delivery in November to Cushing, Oklahoma -- a facility that is capable of handling only 50 million per month.

What will also be pushed aside are some other cold, hard facts, such as Libya's production increases, or Iraq's, or Iran's, and how fundamentally, this means the remaining OPEC members would have to make deeper cuts to offset these increases and still meet the organization's promised cut. Deeper cuts that could hurt whichever member is tasked with taking on this burden.

But to keep the market's eye on the OPEC ball despite market saturation, the Algerian Energy Minister, desperate to save his country from an economic collapse, made yet another announcement on behalf of OPEC that the bloc would be willing to cut yet another 1% ""if we need to"" on top of the cuts proposed out of the meeting in Algiers, adding that there would be even more meetings forthcoming -- the first of which will be in Istanbul on Oct 9-13, again, on the sidelines of another energy meeting, the World Energy Congress. But this time, the informal talks about the freeze will include non-OPEC Russia and non-OPEC Azerbaijan.

Related: The Resurrection Of Putin: What It Means For The Oil Markets

As Reuters reports, the meeting signals that OPEC ""is more serious now about managing the global supply glut."" Russia apparently doesn't share this perceived seriousness, with Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak saying on Friday that he doesn't expect to sign a deal with OPEC during this meeting. Just more talk.

And yet another meeting is scheduled in Vienna for October 28 and 29, according to OPEC sources, followed by a ""long-term strategy"" meeting on November 1-4, and a technical meeting again in Vienna on November 23 and 24, and possibly a follow-up meeting of the High Level Committee a day later on November 25. Finally, recommendations will be presented at the previously disclosed and much anticipated meeting on November 30.

That's plenty of evenly spaced talk that is sure to keep OPEC in media headlines, and give the oil speculators something to play with until that time. After that, it's anyone's guess as to how long prices will hold, but it's likely that regardless of the outcome of the 30 November recommendation meeting, OPEC will continue to feed the beast with talk -- and the market will readily accept the handout, even if it's in lieu of the fundamentals.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Doha', 'Vienna', 'Algiers', 'Venezuela', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Iran', 'Cushing, Oklahoma', 'Iraq', 'United States', 'Nigeria', 'Libya', 'Algeria', 'Istanbul', 'Azerbaijan']",For How Long Can OPEC Talk Up Oil Prices? | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/For-How-Long-Can-OPEC-Talk-Up-Oil-Prices.html,None,

* WTI moved higher on the week by about $1.50 through Thursday as aggressive short covering tied to a bullish IEA report and an informal gathering of OPEC members in September outweighed yet another extremely weak round of DOE stats and accelerating output gains from Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. $43 oil looks to be fairly valued to us at the moment and we continue to wait for the market's longer term bearish momentum to create buying opportunities below $40.

* To that point we still believe that there is enough negative momentum and fundamental justification to move oil into the high $30s. The global overhang of crude remains massive, product hubs are drowning in gasoline and distillates and core OPEC + Russia continue to pump oil at ludicrous speed. Meanwhile the strength of the global economy remains a risk from the demand side as evidenced by this week's IEA report which- despite calling for global stock draws in 3Q'16 and being otherwise bullish- predicted smaller demand gains in 2017 than they had previously envisioned. Additionally, the recent round of short covering and +$4.50 rally may very well invite new short positions into the market. However, we continue to look at prompt WTI in the $38-$39 area as a buy via WTI Z16 $5 - $8 wide call spreads believing that falling U.S. output, geopolitical risks in Venezuela, Nigeria and Libya and an extremely sharp drop in U.S. refiner inputs that should slowly tighten NY gasoline stocks will help move the rebalance story back into headlines this fall. One idea we like is to work a $1.25 bid on the WTI Z16 $46/$51 call spread (currently valued near $1.85, would require a roughly $42.50 print in Z6 for the bid to get hit.) The strategy should pay more than $3 on a move back to $51 for Z16 WTI prior to the option's November 16th expiration.

* Away from the oil market S&Ps and EUR/USD were both supportive for risk assets this week. S&Ps reached a new record high at 2,184 while the EUR/USD rallied from 1.1050 on Tuesday to 1.1190 on Thursday. Central banks were relatively quiet and the U.S. 10yr yield remained in the 1.50 percent-1.60 percent range.

Brent spreads find a bid from positive IEA outlook

Overseas, traders were given fresh OPEC production data to digest beginning with Saudi Arabia's self reporting of record-high output at 10.67m bpd. This number was notably higher, however, than outside sources including Bloomberg which estimated the kingdom's July output at 10.43m bpd. OPEC's own secondary sources estimated Saudi output at 10.48m bpd representing a 30k bpd m/m jump while Iranian production at 3.629m bpd was +13k bpd m/m. Iraq led the group with a 74k bpd m/m increase in production to 4.32m bpd. As for recently troubled areas, Venezuela's production decreased by 20k bpd m/m to 2.095m bpd, Nigeria's production dropped 41k bpd to 1,508m bpd and Libya's production dropped 20k bpd 304k bpd. OPEC reported a group total production of 33.1m bpd (+46k bpd m/m) which actually represents a m/m decline for June's 13 original OPEC members as Gabon's reentry to the group added 230k bpd of production. Bloomberg estimated total OPEC output at 33.2m bpd.

Prompt brent spreads moved sharply higher this week despite the additional oil from core OPEC producers after the IEA's most recent note forecast global crude oil stock draws in 3Q'16. In the front of the curve Brent V16/Z16 moved from -94 to -80. Further back, Brent Z16/Z17 faltered slightly on Wednesday dropping to -4.20 but was never within 40 cents of last week's lows and rallied over -3.80 on Thursday afternoon.

Markets were treated to a bearish 6th straight increase in the U.S. Baker Hughes rig count last week. U.S. rigs currently stand at 381 which is higher by 65 from their May low. However, the increase in rigs has yet to generate production gains in the lower 48 states. Lower 48 production was flat w/w at 8.03m bpd after 20 straight weeks of declines. Overall U.S. crude production currently stands at 8.445m bpd. Canadian imports have remained robust with PADD II imports at a seasonal record of 2.27m bpd.

In the front of the WTI curve WTI V16/Z16 was mostly steady around -1.50 this week and was comfortably between July's high and low marks for the spread. In deferred spreads WTI Z16/Z17 was hit hard mid week moving from -3.60 to -4.20 before a rebounding to -4.00 on Thursday. In spread option markets trade groups continued to sell WTI CSO 1H'17 flat calls and +0.25 calls for small size.

Implied volatility on WTI options moved sharply lower across the skew this week following the market's move above $43. For WTI V16 options, at-the-money volume priced at 38 percent on Wednesday afternoon for a w/w drop of 6 percent. A slight put-skew (consistent with the last 2-3 months) was maintained with 25 delta puts pricing at 41 percent while 25 delta calls implied 37 percent. Realized volatility for WTI (20-day basis) hit a 6-week low at 31 percent after moving as high as 54 percent in mid-July.

Hedge funds still selling oil with both hands while USO traders get bullish

COT data for the week ended August 2nd (we certainly expect to see some short covering in this week's data) showed accelerated selling from hedge funds who have been liquidating longs and adding to short positions on oil for more than two months now. As for NYMEX WTI, net length fell to just 87k contracts in is lower by 65 percent since late May. Gross shorts for WTI have quadrupled since May moving from just 54k to 219k. In ICE Brent net length has been cut to 260k contracts (down 34 percent since May) while gross short positions have jumped from 25k in May to over 125k.

Speculative flows have also stayed bearish in products as hedge funds maintained a net short of 4k contracts in RBOB while cutting their net long in Heating Oil to just 7k. On a more bullish note USO traders have generated inflows into the fund of $325m over the last two weeks which is by far the largest buying spree the ETF has seen since February.

* Markets rallied on Wednesday following a headline gasoline draw of 2.8m bbls

* Unfortunately, gasoline data also included yet another build in PADD IB bringing stocks in the NY area higher y/y by 31 percent.

* Crude oil supplies augmented the bearishness of the report by adding 1m bbls including a 1.6m bbl build in PADD II, 2.6m bbl build in PADD III and 1.2m bbl build in Cushing

* Abysmal refining margins continue to take their toll on demand. Overall inputs fell 255k bpd and are lower by 1.2 percent y/y. PADD I inputs are lower by nearly 11 percent y/y after RBOB/Brent fell to just $7.60/bbl this week.

U.S. crude oil inventories added 1.06m bbls w/w bringing overall stocks higher y/y by 15 percent. PADD I stocks drew by 685k bbls (+18 percent y/y,) PADD II stocks added 1.6m bbls (+10 percent y/y,) PADD III stocks added 2.6m bbls (+21 percent y/y) and Cushing stocks added 1.2m bbls w/w. The East Coast stock draw was largely due to a 365k bpd w/w decrease in imports into the region while PADD III inputs fell by 175k bpd. Overall imports fell to 8.4m bpd and are higher by 12 percent y/y over the last four weeks due to a rush of crude into the East Coast and USGC. U.S. Crude production fell to 8.445m bpd (lower by 15k bpd w/w) and is lower by 70k bpd over the last two weeks.

U.S. refiner inputs fell by 255k bpd w/w due to steep drops in PADD I and PADD II. Overall inputs are down by 1.2 percent y/y and PADD I inputs are lower by 10.8 percent y/y. Crack margins have continued to drive refiners into pronounced maintenance with the WTI 321 crack, gasoil/brent crack and RBOB/brent crack at multi-year seasonal lows of $13/bbl, $9/bbl and $7.60/bbl this week.

Gasoline stats added a bullish jolt to the market Wednesday with a 2.8m bbl overall drop which included significant draws across all five regions. PADD III lead the effort with a 1.3m bbl draw. Unfortunately, the much maligned PADD IB area added 563k bbls w/w to bring inventories in the region to a 31 percent y/y surplus. Overall gasoline stocks are higher by 9 percent y/y. Implied US mogas demand moved higher to 10.2m bpd which is fractionally higher than last year.

In product markets gasoline futures were generally flat near $1.30/gl-$1.35/gl. The weekly low of $1.28/gl was slightly higher than last week's low print. In spread markets RBOB U16/V16 moved below +7 cpg for the first time since July 21st and is lower by 3 cents since August 4th.

U.S. distillate stocks also dropped sharply w/w but built where it counts most in PADD IB. Overall stocks are higher y/y by 2 percent following a 1.96m bbl w/w draw and PADD IB stocks are higher y/y by 6.7 percent following a 1.3m bbl draw. PADD III was the primary driver of the stock draw with a reduction of 3.3m bbls. Domestic distillate demand at 3.94m bpd is higher y/y by 11 percent while exports at 1.3m bpd are lower y/y by 2 percent.

Heating oil futures moved significantly higher on Thursday making three-week highs above $1.37/gl for a 6-cent rally on the week. Prompt futures are stronger by more than 12 cents from their August 2nd low near $1.25. Heating Oil U16/V16 traded over -2 cpg for the first time since July 13th.

Overseas, Singapore distillate stocks fell by more than 2m bbls w/w but are still higher y/y by more than 2.5m bbls. Gasoil stocks in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub fell by 50 k mt and are slightly lower y/y. Gasoil futures moved sharply higher this week to over 401 $/t.

11402786,2016-05-09,"* Libya is facing an intensified threat to its oil as east and west continue in a standoff over control of the country's oil wealth following the east's thwarted attempt at unilaterally exporting. There is now talk that Libya's production could fall by 120,000 barrels per day as this battle intensifies. The problem here is that the West has taken the stance that the Unity government (the Government of National Accord, GNA) is the only way out of the Libyan chaos. It hasn't been approached very adeptly, however. The GNA showed up in Tripoli and got help from armed factions that the internationally recognized government (until recently) finds a bit intimidating. The eastern government in Benghazi is now concerned that it will be sidelined -- and rightly so; hence the attempt to export oil unilaterally and gain some leverage. And it is not impossible for them to gain this leverage. While it's the Tripoli-based National Oil Company that has run things since Gaddafi's fall in 2011, if the newly established Benghazi National Oil Company manages to makes its own oil money, it will indicate that it can survive on its own, and this would be a break-up of the country and a full-fledged civil war, which ISIS would absolutely love. The eastern government will not sign off on the GNA at this point -- at least not until they are sure they can't gain enough leverage to get back into the game....",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Tripoli']",Global Energy Advisory May 6th 2016 | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Global-Energy-Advisory-May-6th-2016.html,None,
11402787,2016-02-26,"The Islamic State (ISIS) is taking on recruits faster than anyone can keep up with, and it's heading towards Libya's oil crescent, eyeing billions of barrels that a country at war with itself cannot protect -- even with U.S. air strikes.

In mid-December, the United Nations brokered a power-sharing agreement between Libya's rival factions, but there is no chance of implementing this. That means there is no chance that the Libyan government can fight back the advance of ISIS. Things are about to get messy, and U.S. air strikes will put only a small dent in a big problem.

According to U.S. intelligence figures, there are an estimated 6,000 ISIS fighters now in Libya, headquartered in the town of Sirte, as Oilprice.com has reported in the past. From here, they control hundreds of miles of coastline. There is nothing in Sirte they want; this is simply a strategic base.

Related: Gulf States Not Willing To Cut Production Despite Asset Depletion

ISIS fighters have also been tracked down to Benghazi, but here they have not solidified control yet. Still, Benghazi is an important recruitment venue. More specifically, this is where it can combine forces with it radical brethren in the form of Ansar al-Sharia and other radical factions. Benghazi is where ISIS gets bigger. And its pace of recruitment is faster than anything we've ever seen before. It absorbs new radical factions wherever it goes. The more successful its attacks and territory grabs, the more successful its recruiting becomes. In Libya, the former prowess of Ansar al-Sharia has quickly waned. ISIS is more brutal, and more decisive. It's either join or be killed.

ISIS' ability to launch attacks is not limited to Sirte, which is just the staging ground, or even to Benghazi. It can attack pretty much anywhere using hit-and-runs and suicide bombings.

So what is it after? There is a multipronged strategy here. The first is to get closer to Europe. The second is to get closer to Africa. The third is to get closer to more oil revenues to fill quickly depleting coffers in Syria and northern Iraq.

The ISIS Oil Picture in Libya

There is no oil in Sirte, but ISIS was able to take control of this area because no one was really paying attention. The tribes here are loyal to Gaddafi, but they took a backseat to Ansar al-Sharia, which in turn took a backseat to ISIS when it arrived.

ISIS has largely been allowed to run amuck in and around Sirte because the raging civil war that pits two rival Libyan governments against each other has left the country incapable of fighting off the ISIS advance. But now ISIS is targeting Libyan oil installations -- and this is what invites U.S. air strikes.

Related: Wall Street Won't Give Up On Its Energy Bets

Last month, ISIS attacked Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, which lie east of Sirte and beyond its area of control. Es Sider is an oil port, and Libya's largest export terminal, with a capacity to export nearly 450,000 barrels per day. Ras Lanuf is a refining area. Ras Lanuf has storage tanks, and the tank attacked by ISIS was holding about 400,000 barrels of oil. The attack on Ras Lanuf was captured on video.

Both Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have been closed since December 2014 -- victims of the civil war that is largely a battle for control over the country's oil wealth. They are perilously located right between ISIS-controlled Sirte and Benghazi in the east.

But ISIS has farther-reaching oil plans in Libya. It's going after the producing fields in the southern desert.

(Click to enlarge)

In a video, ISIS made it clear that it had no plans to stop at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf: ""Today Es Sider port and Ras Lanuf and tomorrow the port of Brega and after the ports of Tobruk, Es Serir, Jallo, and al-Kufra.""

When it gets a foothold in the southern desert's oil crescent, this will be the point of no return.

Related: This Is What Will Cause A Lasting Oil Price Rally

ISIS has already secured the route to the ""oil crescent"", which encompasses all the producing fields in the southern desert. It's done this by taking control of the desert town of Nufaliya, which is about 50 kilometers from Es Sider.

At stake here is Libya's 48 billion barrels of estimated reserves -- the largest in Africa. The civil war alone has shut down over three-quarters of Libya's production, which might be good for the current oil supply glut, but it's very bad for Libya and regional stability.

US air strikes won't likely be enough. ISIS has already cleared a path to the oil crescent, and without a functioning, unified government in Libya, there is no chance of heading them off effectively. Air strikes are but a bandage on a gaping wound.

11402845,2016-07-22,"Irina is a writer for the U.S.-based Divergente LLC consulting firm with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry.

Three export terminals on Russia's Arctic coast shipped an average of 230,000 barrels of crude in the second quarter of 2016. This figure is almost equal to Libya's total daily exports, according to Bloomberg calculations, and it is also a twofold increase from the initial 130,000 bpd handled by Lukoil's Varandey, and Gazprom Neft's Prirazlomnoye and Arctic Gate.

Plans for the future are ambitious - Arctic oil and gas exploration is a clear priority for the Kremlin. A couple of weeks ago, Russia's Natural Resources Minister Sergey Donskoy wrote on his Facebook page that ""the Arctic shelf, despite some project delays related to oil prices, remains a strategic direction for development.""

He added the government has introduced tax relief for companies involved in Arctic exploration and development as a way of stimulating these activities.

Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitriy Rogozin announced the government is working on a comprehensive standard for Arctic exploration that will seek to establish the most appropriate technology and equipment to be used in the development of oil and gas deposits in the region. This also includes the design of new equipment to suit the needs of different fields. In short: Russia is looking North.

Most of the country's current crude oil output comes from giant fields across Siberia, which were discovered decades ago and are now depleting. Russia is much behind the U.S. and Europe in terms of technological advancements in the oil and gas industry, especially in shale, so it would need to rely overwhelmingly on imported equipment if it wants to explore its shale resources. Until these imports can be restarted, however, shale reserves could be difficult to tap.

There are three potentially giant fields in Russia's Arctic that are currently being developed: the onshore Kharyaga, Trebs and Titov, and Prirazlomnoye. Kharyaga was considered a very promising deposit initially, and companies such as Total and Statoil were quick to get on board. Now, however, the reserves of the field have been revised down from 125 million tons to 29 million tons, and Total is out of the picture as operator, transferring this role to Russian Zarubezhneft.

A total of 29 million tons may not be as good as more than 100 million, but it's by no means a small amount. According to Bloomberg estimates, Kharyaga will yield 200,000 bpd in four years.

Gazprom Neft's Prirazlomnoye, according to the company, holds over 70 million tons of crude in recoverable reserves and can yield 5.5 million tons annually. By 2020, Bloomberg estimates, the field would produce 125,000 bpd.

The third field, which is actually twin fields Trebs and Titov, is operated by Lukoil and Bashneft, where production started three years ago. The current year is the first to see commercial-scale output and by 2020, Trebs and Titov should yield 100,000 bpd.

These figures may not sound very impressive right now, but they will enable Russia to maintain its record-high output as its most mature fields yield less and less. And then, when the Western sanctions are lifted - and they will be, sooner or later - Arctic exploration will get another major boost from foreign operators.

If all goes as planned, the Arctic could help Russia surpass Saudi Arabia and the United States as the world's largest oil producer by a large margin. That is, if all goes as planned.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Russia', 'United States', 'Libya', 'Saudi Arabia']",Russia Ramps Up Arctic Oil Production | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Russia-Ramps-Up-Arctic-Oil-Production.html,None,
11402846,2016-01-24,"Geopolitical risk premiums are likely to return to oil markets as the possibility of an attack on a large petroleum facility grows significantly amid rising tensions in the Middle East, possibly putting a floor on prices.

""The risk of an attack is greater than 50pc, which means it is more likely than not,"" president of consultancy ESAI Sarah Emerson said on the sidelines of the Argus Americas Crude Summit.

Oil prices recently plunged to 13-year lows, to sub-$30/bbl, amid expectations a market oversupply will worsen as major supplier Iran ramps up exports following a lifting of sanctions, while the demand outlook remains weak as consumption in key market China slows. The supply-demand mismatch has kept investor attention away from the geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and the worsening economic and social crisis in producers such as Venezuela.

""Everybody has so far been focused on the oversupply,"" chief commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets Helima Croft said, explaining the lack of a risk premium in the market right now. The high level of global oil inventories is giving the market confidence that any disruption in supplies will be quickly filled in, she said.

The latest escalation in the row between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran came earlier this month after Riyadh severed its diplomatic relations with Tehran in response to the storming of its embassy by Iranian protesters angry at the execution of Saudi Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.

Members of the Iranian diplomatic mission to Riyadh have been asked to leave Saudi Arabia within 48 hours, Saudi foreign minister Adel Jubeir said yesterday. Jubeir said the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran was similar to attacks against the British embassy several years earlier, as well as on the U.S. embassy in 1979.

In the current weak market environment, producers can largely be put in two categories - one that is able to ride out the storm and the other that faces worsening prospects, RBC's Croft said. In the first camp are countries such as the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait, which have well-managed economies. In the second are countries such as Iraq, Nigeria, Venezuela, Libya and Algeria, Croft said.

Related: The World Is Not Running Out Of Storage Space For Oil

Croft also said top producer Saudi Arabia is facing pressure from the plunge in prices because ""they redoubled on social commitments"" after the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, Croft said. The country had committed to take care of its people ""from the cradle to the grave."" But with the fall in prices, they have had to announce austerity measures as a budget deficit worsens.

Oil markets may start to balance in 2017 as non-OPEC supplies continue to fall amid prices that render many fields - including many US shale operations - uneconomical, panelists said. But a slowdown in China will temper demand growth.

He also stressed the need to set up a comprehensive strategy to fight terrorism within the country's territories.

In an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper, Sarraj said he was ready to work with the different political forces, highlighting the outcome of the London meeting on Libya, which was held to discuss the country's economic and financial situation.

He added that participants have agreed to hold another meeting in Rome to put the bases for an agreement that would end disputes between the economic and financial institutions.

The Libyan premier called on the military institution to fully cooperate with the presidential council in order to set up a strategy to fight terrorism, adding that military operations in the city of Sirte have reached the final stages.

He also noted that the presidential council was waiting for the next parliamentary session to agree on the constitutional measures needed to form a new government.

Sarraj said that many international and regional efforts were underway to resolve the current problems, adding that he hoped Parliament would assume its role and its responsibilities in the coming period. The premier also said he hoped the country's military institution would cooperate fully with the government to reach a political agreement.

Asked whether a meeting would be held with Parliament Speaker Aguila Saleh and General Khalifa Haftar to unite the political views, Sarraj said: ""We have deployed several efforts to arrange a meeting together; the presidential council is ready to hold dialogue with the different institutions and political forces.""

On the priorities of the presidential council, Sarraj said those include promoting coexistence and resolving all current disputes.

""We should bolster the political agreement in order to end the sufferings of the Libyan people,"" he added.

Commenting on recent measures taken by Tunisia on its borders with Libya to prevent the crossing of militants into both countries, the premier said that such measure would benefit both sides, adding that cooperation was maintained with Tunisian officials to face terrorist threats.

11403973,2016-10-07,"Anti-Gadhafi fighters celebrate the fall of Sirte in the town, Libya. (Reuters)

Libya- As a four wheel vehicle mounted by three fighters and a 14.5 machine gun departed from Sirte's port, a trail of nine similar automobiles followed. Soldiers riding the convoy raised 'V' signs and chanted quotes of victory -- they had just returned from battle with ISIS' ultra-hardline militants.

The soldiers had been a part of the Libya effort called Operation Odyssey Lightning to free Sirte from terrorist hold. The operation includes U.S. military effort supporting the Libyan government against the ISIS terror group, Libya's GNA had aligned forces to retake Sirte.

Five years after Libya's dictator Moammar Gadhafi was deposed in a popular revolution, the country had remained trapped in a spiral of deteriorating security, economic crisis and political deadlock. Public trust in the nation's weak government institutions has fallen to an all-time low as political elites, unable to agree on even a governmental structure, deploy armed militias to control territory and economic assets.

An additional challenge comes from ISIS and other violent extremists exploiting the situation to expand operations in Libya.

Meanwhile, a new, internationally recognized Government of National Accord, the product of a two-year United Nations-led process, continues its struggle to establish legitimacy and control beyond the capital.

Boubacar, a Libyan fighter waiting on the other side, raised his weapon in a gesture of glory mixed with happiness, believing that the approaching convoy of companion fighters was coming to aid in the fight against ISIS and help secure battle locations.

Soon enough, Boubacar's gun was lowered, and a stupefied expression crossed his face as the regiment of nine packed vehicles passed right by him as if he were a stranded desert ghost, later disappearing into the heat of the southern arid desert.

Early on in the day, orders came in from Libya warlords ordering complete withdrawal. Boubacar along with fighters assigned to the 'Lions' brigade, partaking in the Operation Odyssey Lightning, stood in disbelief at what had happened. Victory was there to grab- ISIS militants at a disadvantage- yet soldiers were retreating.

A wave of depression hit the morale of Libya fighters, who at a young age had wasted away in their mission to hunt down and expel terrorists from their country. It is now apparent that the number of forces fighting ISIS had been gradually decreasing in Libya amid widespread confusion combined with rage and a hint of grief.

What remains a mystery is whether GNA's elected Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj was informed of the withdrawal, despite him being the de facto official held accountable for the operation to free Sirte.

On a political level, even outlining the situation in Libya, namely Sirte, remains controversial- Tariq Al Qaziri, a political advisor at the national dialogue that elected Sarraj's presidency and council, says that victory is nearing, while Justice and Construction Party's official Jamal Harisha says that resolution for the war-torn country is far as the true status quo stands empowers militia warlords, leaving the GNA a symbolic value alone.

More so, on national division, Libyan Front commander Salahddine Abdulkarim , says that the true war is being fought the armed forces led by General Khalifa Haftar and not 'some unruly militias', referring to efforts spent by the GNA.

Although the Government of National Accord is now functioning, its authority is still unclear as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon.

The second Libyan Civil War, an ongoing conflict, is among rival groups seeking control of the territory of Libya. The conflict is been mostly between the government of the Council of Deputies that was elected democratically in 2014, also known as the ""Tobruk government"", which is led by General Haftar, and internationally recognized as the ""Libyan Government""; and the rival Islamist government of the General National Congress (GNC), also called the ""National Salvation Government"", based in the capital Tripoli. In December 2015 these two factions agreed in principle to unite as the Government of National Accord.

Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper had launched a series of investigations devoted to uncovering the truth behind the heated clashes with ISIS in Libya, especially in rubble-rendered Sirte.

It is evident that the political unrest in Libya, was the chief reason behind withdrawing forces from the field, even when the fighting against ISIS had started playing into Libya's favor.

He said that in Libya's second city Benghazi in the east, ""more than 100 families are currently trapped in areas of fighting, facing constant bombing and shortages of food, medical care and electricity.""

""The government is spending 93% of its total budget on subsidies and salaries, including those of members of armed groups,"" Kobler continued.

The U.N. envoy also highlighted ""the horrific plight of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers"" trying to reach Europe from Libya.

Paris- The Prime Minister of Libya's U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez al-Sarraj, announced that consultations have been launched to form a new cabinet in the coming weeks.

Sarraj spoke with Asharq al-Awsat in an interview carried out in Paris during his visit to meet with French President Francois Hollande.

Asharq al-Awsat asked, ""The Libyan government is demanding to lift the embargo on weapons exports to Libya. Is there any progress in that matter?""

Sarraj replied that ""there is an embargo on Libya's import of arms .... It is no secret that Libya has a massive arsenal but when the GNA was formed and the Libyan National Army was being restructured - plus the Presidential Guard was launched- we saw that it is necessary to carry out a partial exemption of the embargo.""

""Did you achieve any progress in that regard?"" asked the newspaper.

""We have started official procedures and communication with several parties. My presence in New York was an opportunity to hold a couple of meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Russia, the U.S. and others. During the meetings, I stressed the importance of lifting the embargo. As you know, such a decision requires a U.N. Security Council resolution,"" replied the prime minister.

The newspaper asked, ""The ministerial meeting on Libya in New York focused on the need to conduct a comprehensive dialogue and a national reconciliation. How are you going to achieve that? What are the obstacles preventing the army from being united under the supervision of one authority?""

The prime minister replied, ""Libya's Government of National Accord is based on security, economy and national reconciliation. At the U.N. General Assembly, a national initiative that includes all parties was launched without neglecting any side.""

""Practically speaking, what are the steps you are willing to take in the near future?"" asked Asharq al-Awsat.

Sarraj answered, ""We actually want to showcase the problems leading to division among Libyans. If it's a struggle for authority, the GNA is only serving during this transitional phase until a new constitution is adopted and until elections are held. If the struggle is military, we suggest a prompt ceasefire in all areas.""

""It is known that one of the obstacles is the role and position of Libyan General Khalifa Haftar. How do you intend to deal with this topic under the framework of the national reconciliation?"" asked Asharq al-Awsat.

""I previously met Haftar and it was a unique meeting full of transparency. In a civil country armed forces should fall under a political leadership; I think this is one of the points of contention between us ... There is no veto against anyone and the new government welcomes everyone under the political authority,"" answered Sarraj.

""What is required from you? Reducing the number of ministers, more diversity or a better representation of Libyan regions? How do you describe the new government's philosophy?"" asked the newspaper.

Sarraj denied receiving any official statement from the parliament concerning standards or regulations on forming the new government. ""We are determined to have a government that represents equally all the regions and takes into consideration the current condition,"" he said.

The newspaper asked, ""Why does it feel like the war in Sirte has no outcome?""

""What we have done there is an achievement. In other regions, the fight against ISIS is ongoing for the past two years, and within months only we liberated Sirte and purged it from ISIS.""

Asharq al-Awsat asked, ""Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban requested that Libya establishes large camps for refugees on its territories so that they refrain from moving to Europe. What do you have to say about that?""

""I would like to stress that Libya is a transit country and not a final destination or importing country. Despite this, it has so far dealt positively with the huge number of migrants,"" replied the Libyan Prime Minister.

11403976,2016-09-17,"Cairo-Libyan General Khalifa Haftar turned the tables on his rivals in a move reminiscent to actions taken by his ancestors, who launched their campaigns to rule the country from Cyrenaica, the eastern coastal region of Libya.

Haftar can now pave the way for a new era under his reign after he was able to control about 60 percent of oil resources and Libyan ports.

His capture of the oil ports sparked rumors that he would be able to bring the rest of the country under his authority.

The former head of the legal community for the conference of Libyan tribes, Dr. Mohammed al-Zubaidi, told Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that the army under Haftar's control confused the world after his advance on the so-called oil crescent region although the international community has banned him from receiving military equipment.

""Expect more surprises from the Libyan armed forces,"" he said.

The problem between Libya's east, which is mainly tribal, and its west began during the parliamentary elections of 2014.

When the U.N. interfered to resolve infighting, the Government of National Accord led by Fayez al-Sarraj was created in a deal struck in the Moroccan town of Skhirat following one year of negotiations between the rival parties.

But tribes in the east felt marginalized after the international community backed officials in Tripoli and Sirte, which lie in the country's west.

The parliament had been required to take several measures, such as mentioning the Skhirat agreement in Libya's interim Constitutional Declaration and resolving the controversial clause of the Presidential Council's role in managing the affairs of the military and intelligence.

It was also expected to give Sarraj its vote of confidence to allow his government to function.

It was then that leaders in the country's west began accusing tribes in the east and the National Army led by Haftar of preventing the parliament from giving its confidence vote to Sarraj.

When he failed to win the backing of the parliament, Sarraj began holding talks with officials based in western Libya and abroad. He ended up taking several decisions backed by U.N. special envoy to Libya Martin Kobler to end the crisis.

Yet his move complicated the problem with officials based in the east, mainly the parliament, the army and several tribes.

The Presidential Council is not in a good situation, said Tareq al-Quzairi, one of the advisers of the political deal that led to the Council's establishment.

Its instability comes as analysts predict Benghazi to become the key to political and military change in Libya. Benghazi, which is the second largest city in Libya, has a mixture of tribes from across the country.

The future of the country's political process lies in whatever Benghazi's leaders agree on.

A quick reminder on how the east had a major role in the country's political life: the army that liberated Libya from mandate in the 1940s came up with its plan in the east, the independence speech of the king from the presidential palace in the 1950s was also given in the east.

The young officer, Muammar Gaddafi, chose the east as a starting point for his movement which brought him to power in 1969. The 17 February revolution, which toppled him in 2011, also started from the country's eastern regions.

When Sarraj proclaimed himself the commander in chief of the army by luring some militias to fight ISIS in Sirte and when he sought to receive the backing of tribes in the east in an attempt to unite Libyans behind him, the parliament, the tribes and Haftar ruined his plans.

Dr. al-Zubaidi said that pro-Gaddafi military leaders and officials from the 17 February revolution that toppled him participated in the ""liberation of the oil ports in the eastern region from militias.""

They are also ""setting the stage for their move south and to the west of the country,"" he said.

Al-Zubaidi expressed surprise at Kobler's call for Haftar's army to withdraw from the oil crescent region.

The army proved its patriotism when it handed over the ports to the National Oil Company (NOC), which falls under Sarraj's authority, and allowed it to resume oil exports.

By controlling the ports, the army cut the road short to attempts to divide Libya or create a federal system in the country.

This also forced Sarraj to ""adopt a calm rhetoric and called for dialogue,"" said al-Zubaidi.

Al-Quzairi warned that the country's south and the areas lying near the capital Tripoli would witness escalated measures if no agreements and political deals were struck between the rival parties.

But what concerns Libyans the most is the export of oil and whether its revenues would go to the east or west. Al-Quzairi said that Haftar sought to contain the anger of Western countries and the U.N. Security Council by allowing the NOC to export the oil.

11403977,2016-08-23,"Cairo - The internationally acknowledged Libyan parliament had confused the political scene once again by voting against the U.N.-backed government led by Fayiz al-Sarraj.

Nine months after the Government of National Accord (GNA), the product of a U.N.-backed deal signed in December, has been seeking endorsement for months as it tries to extend its influence and authority beyond its base in Tripoli, in western Libya.

Sarraj didn't make any official comment on the matter, neither did the U.S. or western countries that had always gambled that Sarraj's government would be granted the trust.

Libyan parliament is composed of 200 members, 20 of them at least had lost their membership for different reason. The remaining members were divided among themselves about Sarraj and his government.

This is the second time the parliament votes against the government and its presidential council.

Speaker Akila Saleh said that the no-trust vote was correct with the quorum needed present. He added that the session's agenda was correct because the previous session was suspended.

Akila confirmed that 101 deputies had attended Monday's session, with 61 voting against the GNA, 39 abstaining, and just one voting in favor. The number of attendees was a little over half the chamber.

Parliament's spokesperson Abdullah Bilhaq confirmed that the session was legal with the presence of the members. He added that this is the first time the parliament meets since nine months.

Bilhaq said some lawmakers had opposed the GNA ""from the start because of the lack of credentials and qualifications of the ministers and because the government had not achieved any of the things expected of it"".

The U.S. supported Government of National Accord (GNA), tried to assure that it had been given the trust officially after over hundred MPs signed on a petition.

A bloc of pro-GNA lawmakers accused the government's opponents of hijacking the parliamentary process; they also claimed of receiving deaths threats.

Military wise, forces aligned with Sarraj's government said they have advanced in Sirte and distributed photos of sites under their control.

Media center of Solid Structure Operations issued a statement saying that their forces were able to defeat ISIS fighters and gain control over areas. They said they gained control over 200 residential units in the center of the city. The statement added that the forces were able to gain control over the internal security headquarters used as prison by ISIS.

U.S. announced that up till last Thursday, U.S. aircrafts had launched 65 air raids over Sirte. Deputy Press Secretary Gordon Trowbridge announced there are few hundred jihadists in Sirte, and between one thousand and few thousands in Libya as a whole.

On May 12, forces aligned with Sarraj's government initiated its operations to liberate Sirte that was under jihadists control since last year.

11403978,2016-08-02,"Cairo - The United States Department of Defense announced on Monday the launching of the first U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Libya.

The U.S. has launched airstrikes on the Islamic State stronghold in Sirte, Libya, the Pentagon said on Monday, in a major expansion of the American campaign against the group.

The strikes were requested by Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) and were authorized by President Barack Obama following a recommendation by U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford, Reuters reported.

In a statement, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that Libya's Western-backed unity government had requested the air support as forces under its command battle to reclaim the coastal city of Sirte, which was seized by ISIS last year.

Cook added that ""additional U.S. strikes will continue to target ISIS in Sirte in order to enable [Libya's unity government] to make a decisive, strategic advance.""

Prime Minister of Libya's UN-backed unity government Fayez Serraj said that his government requested U.S. assistance to help the advance of local forces in Sirte.

Speaking in a video statement, Serraj noted that foreign military involvement would remain limited in his country's fight against the terrorist group.

Serraj added that the presidential council of the Government of National Accord (GNA) has decided to ""activate"" its participation in the international coalition against ISIS and requested the United States to carry out targeted air strikes on ISIS.

However, Serraj stressed that foreign military operations were limited to a definite schedule.

""I want to assure you that these operations are limited to a specific timetable and do not exceed Sirte and its suburbs,"" he said.

The prime minister went on to say that foreign assistance on the ground would only consist of logistical and technical support. ""We repeat from here our rejection of interference by any nation or attempts to violate Libya's sovereignty,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said on its website that it has documented 41 civilian casualties, including 12 deaths and 29 injuries, during the conduct of hostilities across Libya during the month of July 2016. Victims included 4 children killed and 4 injured, 8 men killed and 16 injured and 8 women injured, according to the statement.

The statement added that the majority of civilian deaths were caused by gunshots (5 deaths and 2 injured), while the next leading cause of death was vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (3 deaths and 4 injured) and explosive remnants of war (3 deaths), then air strikes (1 deaths and 9 injured) and then shelling (14 injured).

UNSMIL documented 5 deaths and 18 injured in Benghazi, 4 deaths and 11 injured in Derna and 3 deaths in Kufra, it added.

The statement also said that the Libyan National Army/Libyan Air Force carried out airstrikes in Derna, which led to the death and injury of civilians (1 killed, 9 injured), while the Derna Mujahedin Shura Council was responsible for the death of 3 civilians.

Washington, Cairo- After several hesitations on choosing the most adequate way to aid Libya in confronting the impending chaos and threatening terrorist militias; major powers and Libya's neighboring countries on Monday backed lifting the arms embargo on Tripoli, Libya.

Major powers expressed their promptness on delivering arms to the National Accord Government (GNA) lead by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

The Vienna ministerial meeting, convened with the participation of 25 nations and committees, approved the GNA's request on lifting the ban on weapons. Lifting the ban will help the GNA confront ISIS.

The international community undertook upon itself to support Libya's Government of National Accord, which intends to submit an arms embargo exemption to the U.N. Libya Sanctions Committee soon.

Moreover, the major powers supported creating a joint room for military operations, facilitating intelligence information exchange and coordination of missions against terrorist organizations.

The operations room will aid the Libyan national army. Forming of a presidential guard, which would act as core support to the national army, was also among the bolstered proposals at the meeting.

Participants at the Vienna meeting excluded propositions on direct foreign intervention in Libya.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who co-chaired the meeting with Italian peer Paolo Gentiloni, said: ""The international community will support the Presidency Council as it seeks exemption from the U.N. arms embargo to acquire those weapons and bullets needed to fight ISIS and other terrorist groups.""

Al-Sarraj reiterated that his government will provide an arms inventory listing all weapons and ammunition needed. He added that his country does not require foreign intervention as much as it is asking for support.

Al-Sarraj also said: ""We've called for lifting the embargo on arms to support the joint command and the military establishment. We've called for equipping and arming the presidential guard, which will have a clear role in fighting extremism and securing key institutions, and it's not a substitute to police or the army.""

Al-Sarraj, calling the international community to support Libya, said: ""We're not talking about international intervention. We're talking about international assistance and training, equipping our troops and training our youth.""

Foreign Ministers from Turkey, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, the U.S., the EU, U.N., the League of Arab States, and the African Union all signed on the joint communique at the end of their meeting on Libya in Vienna Monday, in which they expressed ""strong"" support for the Libyan people and implied their support for the arms embargo being lifted.

Gentiloni said that the government factor is a crucial ingredient to stabilize Libya.

""With stabilization, we can fight terrorism; we can assure development to a country with rich potentialities but with a strong humanitarian crisis now. We can tackle the migration issue; we can develop the resources of Libya. Without stabilization, we risk tensions, divisions, and intra-Libyans fights,"" he added.

Moreover, a U.S. official told Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that the U.S. alongside four other U.N. Security Council members are willing to support the GNA. They will back lifting the embargo and present required military training and equipping to the GNA.

11403981,2016-05-15,"Tunisia- ISIS terrorist groups have recently stepped up power channeled to target Tunisia from within its Libya centered headquarters, West sources warned. The sources confirmed that the last attack on Ben Gardane, a commune and coastal town in south eastern Tunisia near borders with Libya, proves evident drawback and permeability of the security status in Tunisia.

Sources also highlighted that ISIS fighters have achieved worry-raising operations which point to underlying intentions of the terrorist organization centralizing in Tunisia. Taking refuge and headquarters in Tunisia would replace the space-loss ISIS suffered in Raqqa, Syria, which they have fled after incessant pounding of the coalition's air force.

The Ben Gardane attacks which took place last March are a retaliating campaign avenging U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS locations in Sabratha city, Libya. The airstrike had reportedly taken down ISIS leader, who is of Tunisian origins, Nour Addeine Shoshan.

Attacking Ben Gardane, ISIS hopes to establish a new off-shoot outside Libya in light of the Washington campaign moving towards an intensified military intervention in Libya.

Alternatively, Prime Minister of the Libyan UN-backed government of national accord GNA Fayez Al-Sarraj, speaking to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper, down-sized the ISIS threats imposed on the security and political affairs of both of Tunisia and Libya.

Al-Sarraj considered that the quest for Libyan sovereignty will be won in recognition to the support offered by Tunisia, Algeria and many other neighboring countries, and by the virtue of the U.N.-brokered agreement.

""Neighboring countries are supporting us until security is reestablished across the region, and until the new state's sovereignty is completed,"" said Al-Sarraj.

""Libya-Tunisian bordering zones are a bridge for partnership in which terrorists will not find victory in,"" he added.

Furthermore, Libyan military sources revealed to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that a series of secret meetings between representatives of US and British forces and local leaders loyal to Al-Sarraj's government were held at the Maitiqa base. The sources asserted that they also had information about the presence of British special forces that are fighting alongside the Misrata brigades against ISIS.

11403982,2016-02-11,"The latest declaration by Mr. Staffan de Mistura, UN Special Envoy for Syria, which held Bashar al-Assad's regime responsible for obstructing the negotiations, does not rise to the level of crimes and serious incidents that have increased these days in Syria. What de Mistura is announcing is less than what is expected from the UN, its envoy, and from the great governments, as well as the Arab governments, which are concerned about what is happening from intentional sectarian cleansing, explicit demographic change, murdering and displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians in densely populated cities.

His statements will also not ease shock over attempts to keep President Bashar al-Assad in power until his term ends in the spring of 2018. Keeping Assad in power invalidates the need for negotiations. He should be sued for war crimes rather than being rewarded by keeping him in power under the UN flag.

In 2013, the Syrians were told to wait a year until Assad finishes his presidential term in order to achieve change constitutionally. When the day arrived, he forged elections to become a president again, and he resumed his policy of murder and displacement. Now, the negotiation plan allows al-Assad to stay in power until the spring of 2018.

The Syrian opposition was asked to accept ""upholding the regime"" concept in order to avoid state collapse and not repeat the American mistake in Iraq. It said that it was willing to participate in a national unity government with the regime, but without Assad. Later, it was told to communicate and negotiate with the Russians to end the crisis. The opposition went to Moscow, yet they only heard threats; one of the participants there commented: ""What is left in Syria for us to fear?""

Furthermore, when Washington announced its plan to fight ISIS, it requested the opposition's help as a condition for political and military support, and the opposition accepted; nonetheless Washington did not oppose Russian or Iranian military intervention against moderate rebels. The two alliances' only concern was how to organize aerial military operations in order to prevent clashes between them.

All what Syrians gained from military operations against ISIS were Russian attacks on civilian areas and an increase in Western aid, from blankets and food supplies for refugees.

This series of deceitful promises and impassivity will worsen the humanitarian tragedy and facilitate the spread of terrorism, which is growing fast due to void, chaos and anger.

Politicians are mistaken when they deal with the Syrian crisis as a mere extension of the intricate, straining relations in the Middle East. The Syrian crisis stands on its own, and is not part of the Arab-Iranian, Sunni-Shiite or Russian-American struggles.

Yet, none of that denies the fact that Syria has become an arena for multiple conflicts, but the roots of its crisis are local. The Assad regime resulted from the Cold War, and is affiliated with the Soviets. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it could neither change nor develop. Its situation weakened after the regime's founder Hafez al-Assad died in 2000.

His son Bashar took over, but failed to manage the state, and in 2011 he was confronted with a popular uprising along with the rest of the military-security systems in the region, such as Egypt's Mubarak and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, Gaddafi in Libya, and Saleh in Yemen.

The Arab-Iranian and sectarian struggles are direct repercussions of the regime's collapse, and not the reason for revolting against it. Therefore, it would be impossible to leave Assad ruling unless Mubarak and Gaddafi rule again in Egypt and Libya.

In order to keep Assad in power, Russia and Iran have killed more than 300,000 people, displaced 12 million and destroyed dozens of cities. Additionally, they are now trying to establish a state whose ethnic components suit the capabilities of Assad, who belongs to a sect that only constitutes 10 percent of the population. What madness is that?

11403983,2016-01-29,"In a series of meetings conducted in Libya, Asharq Al-Awsat focused on the details of money and arm conflicts between leaders of different militias in Tripoli.

Informed sources talked about a meeting that was held between two top leaders of Libyan militias during which they discussed the process of transferring billions of dollars from the Libyan Central Bank funds to a safe place outside Tripoli due to the increased signs of civil war among heavily armed agents in the city lying on the Mediterranean Sea.

This coincided with the new alliance between each of the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Libyan Fighting Group, and ISIS.

Sources confirmed for Asharq Al-Awsat that ISIS leader in Tripoli, Mohammed Al-Madhouni, has communicated with leaderships in the Libyan Fighting Group and with members of the former parliament.

They added that Al-Madhouni also concluded bargains for supplying arms with Abu Saif, who participated in Skhirat consultations in Morocco. Moreover, sources revealed that shipments of weapons arrived from dealers operating between Spain and Morocco.

Meanwhile, the US Department of Defense has revealed that it is currently studying the feasibility of a new military operation in Libya in order to prevent the extension of ISIS there. Whereas Italy's Minister of Defense, Roberta Pinotti, has implied that the military intervention in Libya might be carried out before the coming spring.

On the other hand, Army commander of Libya's Tobruk-based parliament General Khalifa Haftar arrived to Cairo, in an unscheduled visit, as the head of the Libyan delegation. His visit timed one week after the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, praised Gen. Haftar's role in releasing twenty Egyptians, who were recently kidnapped in Libya.

11403991,2016-03-01,"Destruction in Benghazi, Libya, last July after fighting between pro-government forces and an alliance of former anti-Qaddafi rebels linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Sharia

Washington- The fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi seemed to vindicate Hillary Clinton since after his fall, militias refused to disarm, neighbors fanned a civil war, and ISIS found refuge.

The US is considering another intervention in Libya, yet this time to fight ISIS; but the question remains whether a military solution is possible in this case.

The current chaos in Libya is certainly due to the military intervention in the country. Back then, Clinton found herself surrounded by British, French, and other doubters.

The military intervention marked a horrible start to the new era for Libya. The dictator was dragged from the sewer pipe where he was hiding, tossed around by furious rebel soldiers, beaten and stabbed.

A cellphone video showed the pocked face of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, ""the Leader"" who had terrified Libyans for four decades, looking frightened and bewildered, knowing he will soon be dead.

The first news reports of Colonel Qaddafi's capture and killing in October 2011 reached the US Secretary of State in Kabul, Afghanistan, where she had just sat for a televised interview. ""Wow!"" she said, looking at an aide's BlackBerry before cautiously noting that the report had not yet been confirmed. Nonetheless, Hillary Clinton seemed impatient for a conclusion to the multinational military intervention she had done so much to organize, and in a rare unguarded moment, she dropped her reserve and exclaimed: ""We came, we saw, he died!""

Two days earlier, Mrs. Clinton had taken a triumphal tour in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and for weeks top aides had been circulating data describing her starring role in the events that had led to this moment.

In one of the memos, her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, wrote, demonstrating Mrs. Clinton's ""leadership, US political orientation toward Libya from the beginning till the end."" The memo's language put her at the center of everything: ""HRC announces ... HRC directs ... HRC travels ... HRC engages,"" it read.

It was a brag sheet for a cabinet member with presidential goals and the Clinton team's eagerness to claim credit for her prompted eye-rolling at the White House and the Pentagon. Some couldn't prevent themselves from laughing after hearing her aides saying that she had practically called in the airstrikes in Libya herself.

However, there were plenty of signs that the triumph won't last long and that the vacuum left by Colonel Qaddafi's death will provoke violence acts and divisions.

In fact, on the same day that Mr. Sullivan compiled his laudatory memo in August, the US Under-Secretary General for Middle East Political Affairs, Jeffrey D. Feltman, had sent a lengthy email with an utterly different tone about what he had seen on his own visit to Libya.

The country's interim leaders seemed shockingly disengaged, he wrote, indicating that Mahmoud Jibril, the acting Prime Minister, who had helped persuade Mrs. Clinton to back the opposition, was commuting from Qatar, making only ""cameo"" appearances in Libya.

In addition, a leading rebel general had been assassinated, underscoring the hazard of ""revenge killings."" Islamists were moving aggressively to seize power and members of the anti-Qaddafi coalition were financing them.

Mr. Feltman reported an alarming lassitude regarding a task of utmost urgency, which was disarming the militia fighters who had dethroned the dictator but now threatened the nation's unity. Mr. Jibril and his associates, he wrote, ""tried to disregard the problem that militias could pose on Libya after Qaddafi's era.""

In short, the well-intentioned men nominally running Libya were relying on ""luck, tribal discipline and the 'gentle character' of the Libyan people"" for a peaceful future. ""We will continue to push on this,"" he wrote.

In the ensuing months, Mr. Feltman's memo proved hauntingly prescient. But Libya's Western allies, preoccupied by domestic politics and the crisis in Syria, soon relegated the country to the back burner.

On the other hand, Mrs. Clinton would be mostly a bystander as the country dissolved into chaos, leading to a civil war that destabilized the region, provoking

the refugee crisis in Europe and allowing ISIS to establish a Libyan haven that the United States is now desperately trying to contain.

""Nobody will say it's too late. No one wants to say it,"" said Mahmud Shammam, who served as chief spokesman for the interim government. ""But I'm afraid there is very little time left for Libya,"" he added.

Media reports referred to Mrs. Clinton's one brief visit to Libya in October 2011 as a ""victory lap,"" but the declaration was definitely premature.

During her visit, security precautions were extraordinary, with ships positioned off the coast in case an emergency evacuation was needed. As it turned out, there was no violence, but the wild celebratory scenes in the Libyan capital that day actually highlighted the divisions in the new order.

""I am proud to stand here on the soil of a free Libya,"" she declared, standing alongside Mr. Jibril. ""It is a great privilege to see a new future for Libya being born. No doubt the work ahead is quite challenging, but the Libyan people have demonstrated the resolve and resilience necessary to achieve their goals.""

Yet everywhere Mrs. Clinton went; there was the other face of the rebellion. Crowds of Kalashnikov-toting fighters, or revolutionaries, as they called themselves, mobbed her motorcade and pushed to glimpse the American celebrity. Mostly they cheered, and Mrs. Clinton remained poised, but her security guards watched the uproar with much concern.

Mrs. Clinton certainly understood how hard the transition to a post-Qaddafi Libya would be. In February, before the allied bombing began, she noted that political change in Egypt had proved tumultuous despite strong institutions.

""So imagine how difficult it will be in a country like Libya,"" she said. ""Qaddafi ruled for 42 years by basically destroying all institutions and never even creating an army, so that it could not be used against him.""

Earlier, the President's National Security Adviser, Tom Donilon, had created a planning group called ""Post-Qaddafi.""

Mrs. Clinton helped organize the Libya Contact Group, a powerhouse collection of countries that had pledged to work for a stable and prosperous future. By early 2012, she had flown to a dozen international meetings on Libya, part of a grueling

schedule of official travel in which she kept competitive track of miles traveled and countries visited.

For his part, Dennis B. Ross, a veteran Middle East expert at the National Security Council, argued unsuccessfully for an outside peacekeeping force; but with oil beginning to flow again from Libyan wells, he was pleasantly surprised by how things seemed to be going.

""I had unease that there wasn't more being done more quickly to create cohesive security forces,"" Mr. Ross said. ""But the last six months of 2011, carried a fair amount of optimism.""",Asharq Al-Awsat English,energy,,"['United States', 'Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Tripoli', 'Kabul', 'United Kingdom', 'Syria', 'Qatar', 'Egypt']",New Libya Fighting Chaos - ASHARQ AL-AWSAT,http://english.aawsat.com/2016/03/article55348022/new-libya-fighting-chaos,None,
11404101,2016-08-03,"What is happening in Syria is a real international farce, especially the crimes being committed in Aleppo and in the surrounding areas. The United Nations, America and the west are witnesses to this farce. While Assad's regime continues to besiege Aleppo with the support of Russia, the US Secretary of State makes statements that do not make sense. Washington wants to distance itself from the Syrian crisis!

After a Russian helicopter was shot down in Idlib and its crew killed, the US Secretary of State made statements demanding that the Russians, the Assad regime and the opposition restrain themselves. He also called for a week long truce in Aleppo! Kerry says that this is treating the murderer and the murdered equally! Kerry says this at a time when the town of Saraqeb, in which the Russian aircraft was shot down, is being attacked with toxic gas. Despite this, Kerry is calling on all parties to exercise restraint. Even the Secretary-General of the United Nations has not issued a statement or an expression of concern at the time of writing this article.

The farce does not stop there; there is now controversy between the Americans and the Russians about Washington's military operations against ISIS in Libya. The Russian ambassador there said that the strikes are illegal and that they should have taken place with the permission of the Security Council. The question here is ""Do the Russians have UN authorisation to carry out strikes in Syria and kill innocent people?"" Does Iran have a UN resolution authorising it to send armed militias there and contributing to the killing of innocent people? The matter is indeed puzzling and demonstrates that the west, led by the United Nations and America, is not keen on ending the Syrian crisis and the suffering of the Syrians, even if Iran intervened by sending terrorist militias and is thereby deepening the sectarianism in Syria.

This is despite the fact that the Russians continue to kill innocent Syrians and Assad continues to use barrel bombs, attack hospitals and use toxic gasses. It is for this reason that we call the situation a farce. There will be serious consequences in the region and the west, and this waterfall of blood will sink everyone and increase sectarian hatred and terrorism.

The shooting of the Russian helicopter and the magnitude of the crimes committed by Assad and his supporters in Syria does not necessitate restraint. Rather, it necessitates the posing of serious questions that include ""What has been gained from Russian intervention in Syria until now? What are the results of Iranian interference and their militias?"" Nothing really; Assad is still weak, the opposition hasn't been defeated and the crisis has not ended.

This means that it is now necessary to start finding practical solutions in order to attain political goals. The first of these steps is telling the Russians and the Iranians ""So, you have tried everything and we have run out of patience with you. Now is the time to swallow the bitter cup. If you want war, this is its form and taste. If you want to take political action, then you can go to Geneva or any other place.""

As for Kerry's statements, they indicate that the crisis will be prolonged and that the US President Obama is evading his failure in Syria. It is for this reason that he has deserted Syria and has moved his attention to military action in Libya whilst waiting for his presidency to end. This is why the situation in Syria can be described as an international farce.

11404313,2016-12-26,"Forces loyal to Libya's eastern government said they staged an air strike against opponents in the central Jufra region on Monday. Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), said the strike had targeted a camp used by the Benghazi Defense Brigades (BDB), a force that the LNA has previously clashed with.

Led by Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar the LNA over the last few months has made substantial military gains in Benghazi and Libya's Oil Crescent region, provoking several attempted counter-attacks by rivals.

""This was a pre-emptive strike against militias that are mobilizing for an attack against the Libyan army,"" Mismari said. There was no immediate comment from the BDB.

Images from the oasis town of Houn posted on local media sites showed thick smoke rising close to residential buildings. No casualties were reported.

The LNA carried out air strikes this month to repel what it said was an attempt to recapture Oil Crescent ports it took control of in September. Shortly afterwards, it launched strikes against opponents at a military base in Jufra.

The strikes have raised fears of a new escalation in Libya's conflict. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has so far failed to reconcile Libya's warring factions.

11404314,2016-10-24,"Fayez Al-Sarraj, Prime Minister of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) announced a possible meeting between him and the Libyan National Army (LNA) leader General Khalifa Haftar on Sunday. PM Sarraj also promised to terminate the non-constitutional parallel government led by Khalifa al-Ghawil in Tripoli.

The meeting raised hopes on removing tension from the war-torn country.

Sarraj also for the first time hinted using force to settle the conflict in Tripoli, saying that dealing with Ghawil's forces had been done with cautious

wisdom until this moment, yet should the need arise, fiddling will be put to an end. Sarraj also highlighted that Ghawil's government has reportedly been cooperating with armed militias.

Five years after toppling authoritarian Prime Minister Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's capital Tripoli remains conflicted and overrun by the fighting of three governments each reaching out for a power grab.

Sarraj announced being fully prepared to sit down with LNA leader Haftar to find a solution for the Libya crisis, Sarraj said in his on-screen speech to the United Nations delegation.

Sarraj however dodged questions on his previous criticism against Haftar, labeling him a war criminal in his recent press Tripoli conference.

GNA leader Sarraj reiterated the importance of sticking to the Sikhrat agreement guidelines on distribution of power.

Haftar had met with Sarraj last January with Egyptian mediation, yet the talks led to no clear results between the conflicting parties.

Ongoing conflict in Libya, beginning with the Arab Spring protests of 2011, led to the First Libyan Civil War, foreign military intervention, and the ousting and death of Muammar Gaddafi.

The civil war's aftermath led to violence and instability across the country, which erupted into renewed civil war in 2014.

The second Libyan Civil War is a conflict among rival groups seeking a power grab over territory of Libya.

The conflict has been mostly between the government of the Council of Deputies that was elected democratically in 2014, also known as the ""Tobruk government"" and internationally recognized as the ""Libyan Government""- and the rival Islamist government of the General National Congress (GNC), also called the ""National Salvation Government"", based in the capital Tripoli.

In December 2015 these two factions agreed in principle to unite as the GNA. Although the GNA is now functioning, its authority is still unclear as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon.

A group of militiamen staged an attack on a high-security prison in Niger early on Monday in an apparent effort to free extremist militants. The assault was repulsed and no inmates escaped, authorities said.

Suspected members of Boko Haram and other hardliners are held at the prison at Koutoukale, 50 km northwest of the capital Niamey. Boko Haram has carried out raids into Niger from its bases across the border in northeastern Nigeria.

""I can confirm one dead among the attackers. He was wearing a suicide vest,"" Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum told Reuters by telephone. ""The situation is now under control and our forces are combing the area to try to catch the attackers still at large,"" he said. A ministry spokesman said no prisoners escaped.

Bazoum said the most likely culprits were the Mali-based Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA), one of a number of armed groups operating in the widely unpoliced Sahara.

The landlocked West African country is surrounded by unstable states, most of them struggling with extremist insurgencies. Militants have also crossed from Mali to its west and Libya's conflict to its north threatens the whole region.

""We heard sustained gunfire coming from the prison just as we were going for (early morning) prayers,"" the director of the Koutoukale school, Abdoul Razak Ali, said by telephone.

The attack came days after gunmen raided the house of a United States aid worker in central Niger, killed his guards and drove him across the desert towards Mali.

Gunmen also attacked a refugee camp earlier this month in Niger's western Tahoua region bordering Mali, killing 22 soldiers.

An Amnesty International official who visited the prison in June said it held around 550 inmates, more than double the prison's capacity, and the overwhelmed court system had too few judges to bring them to justice properly.

Most inmates were suspected members of Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency based in northeastern Nigeria. A small number were suspected of belonging to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other militant groups, the official said.

Cairo- Chairman of Libya's Presidential Council of the Government of National Accord (GNA) Fayez al-Sarraj revealed that the council's meetings on forming a new cabinet will be on Libyan territory.

""The current political standing will not accept the GNA's presence abroad any further,"" said Sarraj.

Sarraj's statement was released from his media office, after holding a meeting with the nine council members in Tunisia. GNA meetings come at a critical time for Libya as it descends into conflict. Disputes must be set aside, and priority must be given to national interest, said Sarraj in his statement.

All nine members of the PC also said that they want their next meeting to be held in Libya.

A statement to that effect published on the Presidency Council's Facebook page was confirmed by PC member Musa Koni who said that it was unacceptable to decide on a government while outside Libya.

He was forming a committee to decide where to go, he disclosed, and a decision would be reached by the end of the weekend.

He further stated that so far in Tunis the PC had not discussed the new cabinet. That would start after the decision had been reached on where to convene.

Apart from logistical issues and security considerations which disbar most towns and cities, Ali Gatrani, close to Khalifa Haftar and a main voice of the east in the PC, refuses to go anywhere that he considers not under legitimate military control. That excludes not only Tripoli, but also places that others see as sufficiently neutral, such as Nalut in the Jebel Nafusa.

He would be quite happy with Tobruk, Marj or Beida, but Misrata's Ahmed Maetig has concerns for his personal safety in such places. Almost nowhere, other perhaps than Ghadames, Ghat or possibly Hun might meet all the PC members' considerations.

PC members also met with U.N. Special Envoy Martin Kobler who has been encouraging a decision on a new government as soon as possible.

Rabat- Moroccans went to the polls on Friday to elect a new parliament, which is made up of 395 seats. The elections are considered to be the second held since the Moroccan constitutional referendum in 2011.

Around 16 million Moroccans are eligible to vote, with 30 parties competing for seats. Turnout will be a key factor, especially it being extremely affected by the public's negative attitude towards politics, it reached only 45 percent in the November 2011 polls.

Despite the relatively low turnout, it remains a better result than the 37 percent in 2007.

A list system and an electoral threshold that has been halved from six to three percent could hand small parties a key role in forming the next government. But no party openly challenges the king, who retains most executive authority. Voters will select lawmakers for the 395-seat House of Representatives. The prime minister will be selected by the king from the party that wins most seats.

Elections are taking place on Friday, which is considered an official workday in Morocco, despite opposition blocs having demanded that the polls be held on a Sunday, a day off, as to enable the greatest number of electorates to vote.

A wave of tension and political turbulence had hit Morocco's climate.

The Islam-based Justice and Development Party (PJD) aims to fight off a liberal opposition which says it wants to roll back the ""Islamisation"" of Moroccan society.

The 13-day campaign held to downsize the PJD's popularity, registered no harm.

PJD Leader Abdelilah Benkirane was still very much a crowd puller, as thousands attended all his speeches throughout his electoral campaign.

The PJD came to power in 2011, months after massive street protests prompted concessions from the monarchy.

A new constitution transferred some of the king's powers to parliament, at a time when autocratic regimes were falling in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.

Political analysts expect that the PJD will have the highest turnout, followed by the Authenticity and Modernity Party, then by the Istiqlal Party.

11404343,2016-09-16,"Cairo- General Khalifa Haftar made history in Libya as he is the first military official to be promoted to field marshal by parliamentarians in the east of the country.

The promotion coincided with the sudden arrival of Fayez Al-Sarraj, head of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord, in Cairo accompanied by a delegation. The visit was unscheduled and unannounced.

General Haftar is known to be at odds with the GNA which has allocated the defense portfolio to another officer, Ibrahim al-Barghathi.

Cairo has been mediating between the Haftar and Sarraj governments.

Sarraj visited Cairo to meet some members of the Libyan House of Representatives (HoR) to talk about the need to form the Government of National Accord (GNA) urgently, for the third time.

The visit comes after the recent political and military developments in Libya, especially after the Army affiliated to the Interim government, under the leadership of Haftar, controlled the oil crescent region.

Officials at the army acting under the Haftar-led interim government orders, believe that there are international efforts of having the oil crescent case go in favor of the Sarraj-led GNA.

With those concerns, along with the international powers forcing the GNA on the people of Libya, officials justified the take back of the crescent oil fields.

Libya's Justice and Construction Party, the Muslim Brotherhood branch in the African state, urged that all the state's oil fields are put under the internationally-backed government of Sarraj. The reason behind this is to kickstart the economic wheel through authorizing and resuming oil exports.

The bloc confirmed through a statement that all military, security and police forces must be united and impartial. The government must not be overrun by the military whatsoever, the statement said.

Officials added that spurring strife and rolling the drums of civil war only means more death and destruction, not to mention a great opportunity for terrorism to slip even deeper into the already penetrated oil state.

All Libyans were called to back the political solution, the Morocco-sponsored Skhirat agreement, signed at the end of 2015.

The Libyan political agreement states that this dialogue is based on four main principles -- Far and foremost ensuring the democratic rights of the Libyan people, the need for a consensual government based on the principle of the separation of powers, oversight and balance between them, as well as the need to empower state institutions like the GNA so that they can address the serious challenges ahead and respect for the Libyan judiciary and its independence.

Cairo-The Libyan National Army (LNA) has shrugged off calls by the U.S. and five other western governments to withdraw from the oil crescent region, which LNA seized two days ago.

As the eastern region cities prepare to witness protests in support of LNA, the governments of U.S., Germany, Spain, France, UK and Italy denounced what they described as attacks against oil ports in Zuwaytina, Ras Lanuf, Sidra and al-Barika. The governments called on all parties to abide by the ceasefire and abstain from conducting any new battle.

They said in a joint statement that the U.N.-brokered government based in the capital, Tripoli, is the ""sole steward of these resources,"" adding that ""Libya's oil belongs to the Libyan people.""

The statement urged forces to withdraw immediately from the oil crescent region without preconditions. It also insisted that Libyan forces join efforts to combat ISIS and other terrorist groups, defined earlier by the U.N.

Parliament Speaker Aguila Saleh Issa stated that the National Oil Corporation in Libya (NOC) will be in charge of the oil terminals in Zuwaytina and the oil crescent region. Issa's instructions included that the NOC assign guards to protect the oil facilities.

The release of the statement coincided with U.N. Libya envoy Martin Kobler expressing concern over the battles in the oil crescent region and urging LNA to abstain from any military escalation.

Kobler declared that U.N. Security Council resolution 2259 stipulates banning illegal oil exports. He added that the attacks on the oil crescent region threaten stability in Libya and widens the gap between Libyans.

The U.N. Libya envoy encouraged talks that might lead to the formation of a new national accord government.

Also Tuesday, Italian Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti affirmed that 200 soldiers will be sent to guard a hospital that Italy is willing to establish in Misrata.

Left powerless and unable to get specialist care for his six-year-old daughter in Libya or a visa for treatment abroad, Abdulhakim Shaybi bought a motor boat and set off with her last month across the Mediterranean.

Two-and-a-half hours into their journey from Sabratha in western Libya, they reached a European ship deployed to rescue migrants, Reuters reported.

""I raised a white flag to the ship in a sign of peace,"" Shaybi said from the Italian city of Genoa, where his daughter Sajida, who has the rare blood cell disease aplastic anemia, is now undergoing tests.

""My friend told them that we have a sick little girl.""

The story was quickly picked up on social media as an example of the tragic consequences of Libya's health system collapsing amid poor security, a funding crisis, and chronic shortages of staff and medicine.

Shaybi said he decided on the boat trip after visiting Tripoli Central Hospital earlier this year and had found it ""in a disastrous condition, one hundred times worse than before. There was no nursing staff at night, no medicine, and no health care at all.""

Afflicted by power and water cuts and starved of resources, the hospital is now in a forlorn state.

Three months ago the emergency room was shut after one male nurse was shot and another was beaten. The morgue has run out of space because staff are waiting for authorization to bury bodies unspoken for.

Of 250 foreign nurses, just 40 are left, and female Libyan nurses are afraid to work because of security threats.

""We are only conducting emergency operations now,"" General Manager Mukhtar al-Habbas told Reuters.

""We have no anesthetic, sterilizing materials, or medical gauze, so how we can work?,"" he added.

The situation is consistent throughout Libya. About half of the country's 159 hospitals are either closed or barely delivering services, said Haroon Rashid, a World Health Organization official.

Rashid adds that indigenous malaria cases have recently resurfaced in the south, and it fears a re-emergence of polio as well as increasing resistance to HIV drugs due to users switching between different brands because of lack of supply.

Political turmoil, corruption, and financial pressure caused by a steep fall in oil earnings have cut off funding to health facilities, yet Libya's underlying wealth means foreign donors are reluctant to give.

""Everyone is saying that Libya is a rich country, and they may have frozen assets but they have nothing in hand,"" said Rashid.

At the Tripoli Medical Centre, the largest state hospital in the capital, metal donation boxes have been placed at the entrance and the walls of the pharmacy are bare.

Some equipment has been switched off by contractors who haven't been paid, said General Manager Mohammed Ehnaish, and the remaining nursing staff threaten to leave over lack of salaries.

ISIS fighters drew back from long-held positions around the port city of Derna on Wednesday, military forces in eastern Libya said, as forces loyal to the government in the region pushed forward with an offensive in Benghazi.

The retreat around Derna, if confirmed, could mark a momentous shift in the alignment of forces in the area.

ISIS took hold of territory in Libya as two conflicting governments and a number of armed factions came to blows to control the country in the past two years. But it has also faced resistance from other local armed groups on the ground.

Derna was an early stronghold for the terrorist group, as it had witnessed a history of jihad. The militant group lost control of the city last June to rival armed jihadist grouped under the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council, but retained positions around the outskirts.

Derna and its suburbs had been ""completely liberated from the apostates"", the council said in a statement.

Military forces loyal to Libya's eastern government said on Thursday they had carried out air strikes overnight against jihadists in Derna after ISIS militants retreated from positions close to the city.

Fighters from ISIS had controlled the city until the Shura Council forces pushed them out last June. The military has attacked both groups.

Military spokesman Abdulkarim Sabra said the overnight air strikes had targeted Shura Council fighters in Derna's Sayeda Khadija neighborhood and at Bishr prison. He made no comment on possible casualties.

Shura Council spokesman Hafed Addabaa said the prison had held ISIS suspects and added that the strikes had not caused any casualties or damage.

Eastern security forces, which are allied to a government based in the east, have carried out occasional strikes against jihadist rivals around Derna in recent months.

Sabra said ISIS had retreated from Derna's 400 neighborhood and al-Fatayeh, 20 km (12 miles) south of the city, and its forces were attempting to head towards the militant group's Libyan stronghold of Sirte when they were cut off.

The military was providing air support for troops, he said. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Some Derna residents rejoiced, waving Libyan flags on the streets, according to pictures circulating on social media.

Eastern military forces have also been involved in heavy fighting around 250 km (155 miles) to the west in Benghazi, where they have captured several neighborhoods from fighters loyal to ISIS and other groups.

Clashes continued there on Wednesday, and the military said it had nearly full control of the southern district of Guwarsha. The fighting resulted in the death of one commander and the injury of four soldiers, the army said.

The eastern government was set up after armed opponents took control of the capital, Tripoli, in 2014, and established a contending administration. Both are backed by alliances of former rebels who once fought together to oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Last month, a U.N.-backed unity government arrived in Tripoli, where it has been trying to establish its authority. The West regards the new government as the best chance of terminating Libya's political divisions and uniting its armed factions to take on ISIS.

But the government has yet to win approval from Libya's eastern parliament, which received international recognition and has repeatedly failed to hold a vote on the issue.

Lawmakers in the east who support the new government say they have been threatened and physically impeded from holding a vote, including when they tried to convene on Monday.

They have been opposed by allies of eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, who are concerned about losing control of military appointments if the unity government takes full power.

In an apparent attempt to break the ice with the eastern military, the unity government's leadership released a statement on Wednesday congratulating it on its advances in Benghazi.

The Presidential Council said it would ""provide all necessary support to Benghazi and other affected cities for reconstruction,"" and that it was committed to ""supporting the institution of the army"".

It also congratulated the ""people of Derna and all Libyans"" on the ""liberation"" of the areas around where ISIS pulled out.

He added that the Libyan Dialogue Commission members were expected to arrive from Tunisia on Saturday evening to discuss the latest proposals for a national unity government, which will be reached by the Presidency Council, before the latter later sends it to the House of Representatives, which is internationally known as (Tobruk Parliament), for approval.

The head of Presidency Council, prime minister-designate Faiez al-Sarraj, has earlier called for a meeting with members of the Libyan Dialogue in Skhirat, Morocco.

In a letter to the Dialogue, Serraj said he wanted the Dialogue to look at the latest, slimmed-down, proposed cabinet before sending it to the House of Representatives (HoR) for approval.

The Libyan Political Agreement is now officially part of Libyan legislation. After it was signed in Skhirat in December, the Libyan parliament or House of Representatives (HoR) adopted it in January with one reservation related to Article 8 of the Agreement's additional provisions.

By taking this pivotal step, the HoR made the overdue United Nations-backed Political Agreement part and parcel of the Libyan Constitutional Declaration, the temporary constitution governing the remaining transitional period in Libya.

The Political Agreement created two new additional governing institutions: the Government of National Accord (GNA), composed of a Presidential Council of nine members and a cabinet of ministers; and the High Council of State (HCS), derived from the remnant General National Congress (GNC). Perhaps most importantly, the Political Agreement renewed the legitimacy of the HoR as the sole legislative authority of the country.

However, while adopting the agreement, the HoR also simultaneously rejected the cabinet proposed by Mr. Al-Sarraj, the head of the Presidency Council.

The parliament neither published its decision nor the reasoning behind it; however, according to media speculation, it was due to the composition of the proposed government, particularly its expansion to 32 ministers. Some HoR representatives added that the proposed cabinet lacked expertise.",Asharq Al-Awsat English,energy,,"['Skhirat', 'Rabat', 'Libya', 'Morocco', 'Tobruk', 'Tunisia']",Libyan National Unity Government to be Announced in Skhirat,http://english.aawsat.com/2016/02/article55347355/libyan-national-unity-government-to-be-announced-in-skhirat,None,
