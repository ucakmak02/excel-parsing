9905638,2019-12-30,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is considering sending allied Syrian fighters to Libya as part of planned military support for the besieged government in Tripoli, senior Turkish sources said on Monday, potentially bringing more foreign influence into the complex conflict.

President Tayyip Erdogan said last week Turkey would deploy troops to Libya after Fayez al-Serraj's internationally-recognized government requested support to fend off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's eastern forces.

The move is meant to protect Turkish private investment in Libya and bolster its energy claims in the Mediterranean, but could also put Ankara at odds with other foreign players in the war.

Two senior Turkish government officials and two security officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Ankara had not yet deployed any Syrian fighters to Libya.

""But evaluations are being made and meetings are being held on this issue, and there is a tendency to go in this direction,"" said one official, adding no decision had been made on numbers.

Turkey-backed Syrian fighters spearheaded a Turkish military incursion into northeast Syria in October targeting a Kurdish militia. Ankara, which opposes President Bashar al-Assad, also backs Syrian rebels in the northwest province of Idlib in Syria's nearly nine-year civil war.

It was unclear whether Ankara was mulling sending Syrian fighters as part of a first deployment into Libya.

Haftar's forces - supported by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan - have failed to reach the center of Tripoli. But they have made small gains in recent weeks with the help of Russian and Sudanese fighters, as well as drones shipped by the UAE, diplomats say.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitor, cited sources saying 300 Turkey-backed Syrian fighters had been sent to Libya while others were training in Turkish camps.

However, a spokesman for the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) on Monday denied that Ankara had made a request to send FSA fighters to Libya.

A military source within the FSA said the FSA was not being deployed to Libya, but that Syrian fighters in Syria and Turkey had signed up on an individual basis, for a salary, to work as ""bodyguards"" for a Turkish security company to protect bases and headquarters which Turkish forces will use in Libya.

Turkey's military has been involved in Syria since 2016.

""The military's experience abroad will be very useful in Libya. However, there is the possibility of using the experience of Syrian fighters as well,"" said one of the security officials.

""After parliament accepts the mandate, a step may be taken in this direction,"" the person added.

Ankara signed two accords with Libya's government last month: one on security and military cooperation and another on boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.

The maritime deal ends Turkey's isolation at sea as it ramps up offshore energy exploration that has alarmed Greece, Cyprus and others. The military deal would preserve its lone ally in the region, Tripoli, and protect investments by construction firms and other Turkish companies.

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said Turkey aims to prevent Libya sliding into chaos. Erdogan, who discussed the Libyan conflict with his Tunisian counterpart last week, has said a ceasefire in Libya must be set as soon as possible.

The deployment bill was sent to parliament on Monday, prompting the main opposition party to reject it on grounds it would exacerbate conflict.

The bill's text warned that Haftar's army has threatened Turkish companies in Libya and Turkish ships in the Mediterranean.

""Turkey's interests ... will be negatively impacted if attacks by the so-called Libyan National Army are not stopped and clashes become a severe civil war,"" it said.

Turkey exported $1.5 billion in jewelry, furniture, poultry and other goods to Libya last year, more than quadruple the imports of mostly metals from the North African country.

Construction firms including Ustay Yapi, Tekfen (TKFEN.IS) and Guris Insaat dominate the Turkish-Libya Business Council's board, highlighting the sector's interests there.

9905639,2019-12-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is ""very concerned"" about the intensification of the conflict in Libya, with a rising number of reported Russian mercenaries supporting Khalifa Haftar's forces on the ground turning the conflict into a bloodier one, a senior State Department official said on Saturday.

The United States continues to recognize the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Fayez al-Serraj, the official said, but added that Washington is not taking sides in the conflict and is talking to all stakeholders who could be influential in trying to forge an agreement.

""We are very concerned about the military intensification,"" the official told Reuters. ""We see the Russians using hybrid warfare, using drones and aircraft...This isn't good.""

""With the increased numbers of reported Wagner forces and mercenaries on the ground, we think it's changing the landscape of the conflict and intensifying it,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to a shadowy group of mercenaries known as Wagner.

Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in the capital Tripoli and the east. Serraj's government is in conflict with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya.

Haftar is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and most recently Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials. The issue has come up in a meeting earlier this month between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.

Pompeo said there could be no military solution to the fighting and that Washington had warned countries against sending weapons to Libya, adding that he reminded Lavrov specifically of the U.N. arms embargo on Libya.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying since April to take Tripoli. Earlier this month, he announced what he said would be the ""final battle"" for the capital but has not made much advance.

The U.S. official said the involvement of Russian mercenaries so far has not tipped the conflict in favor of Haftar. ""It's creating a bloodier conflict...more civilian damage, damage to infrastructure like the airports..hospitals have been targeted. But at the same time we don't see that Haftar is gaining ground.""

Turkey has backed Libya's internationally recognized government led by Fayez al-Serraj and the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on maritime cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean as well as a security agreement which could deepen military cooperation between them.

In a first reaction from the United States on the agreements between Turkey and Libya, the U.S. official said the maritime MOU was ""unhelpful"" and ""provocative.""

""Because it's drawing into the Libyan conflict interests that up until now had not been involved in the situation in Libya,' the official said. ""With maritime boundaries, you're drawing in Greece and Cyprus...from the United States' perspective, this is a concern...it's not the time to be provoking more instability in the Mediterranean,"" the official said.

Ankara has already sent military supplies to Libya in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month. Its maritime agreement with Libya enraged Greece and drew ire from the European Union.

9905640,2019-12-11,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States wants to work with Russia to end the conflict in Libya, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, but he added that he reminded Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a day ago of the arms embargo that is in place on the North African country.

Speaking at a news conference at the U.S. State Department, Pompeo said there could be no military solution to the fighting and that Washington had warned countries against sending weapons to Libya.

""We want to work with the Russians to get to the negotiating table, have a series of conversations that ultimately lead to a disposition that creates what the UN has been trying to do,"" Pompeo said.

""Foreign Minister Lavrov told me directly yesterday he is prepared to be part of that, to continue it. I reminded him that there is a weapons embargo that is still in place in Libya, and that no nation ought to be providing incremental materiel inside of Libya,"" he said.

Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in the capital Tripoli and the east. Fayez al-Serraj's government is in conflict with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying since April to take Tripoli. He is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and most recently Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials. The LNA denies it has foreign backing.

U.S. President Donald Trump called Haftar in the first weeks of the offensive, in a move that some diplomats took as sign Washington might be backing the former Gaddafi officer. But the United States last month called on the LNA to end its offensive on Tripoli. It also warned against Russia's interference.

""We have reached out not only to the Russians but to others who are providing weapon systems there and saying it's not in the best interest,"" Pompeo said.

Diplomats say Turkey has supplied drones and trucks to forces allied to Serraj, while the LNA has received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

9905641,2019-12-07,"(Reuters) - The U.S. military believes that an unarmed American drone reported lost near Libya's capital last month was in fact shot down by Russian air defenses and it is demanding the return of the aircraft's wreckage, U.S. Africa Command says.

Such a shootdown would underscore Moscow's increasingly muscular role in the energy-rich nation, where Russian mercenaries are reportedly intervening on behalf of east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar in Libya's civil war.

Haftar has sought to take the capital Tripoli, now held by Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).

U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, who leads Africa command, said he believed the operators of the air defenses at the time ""didn't know it was a U.S. remotely piloted aircraft when they fired on it.""

""But they certainly know who it belongs to now and they are refusing to return it. They say they don't know where it is but I am not buying it,"" Townsend told Reuters in a statement, without elaborating.

The U.S. assessment, which has not been previously disclosed, concludes that either Russian private military contractors or Haftar's so-called Libyan National Army were operating the air defenses at the time the drone was reported lost on Nov. 21, said Africa Command spokesman Air Force Colonel Christopher Karns.

Karns said the United States believed the air defense operators fired on the U.S. aircraft after ""mistaking it for an opposition"" drone.

An official in Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) told Reuters that Russian mercenaries appeared to be responsible.

Russian authorities deny using military contractors in any foreign military theater and say any Russian civilians who may be fighting abroad are volunteers. The LNA denies it has foreign backing.

One current and one former Russian contractor told Reuters that since September the LNA had received ground support from several hundred private military contractors from a Russian group.

Military officials linked to the GNA and Western diplomats have also confirmed the presence of Russian contractors in Libya.

Haftar, who claims to be fighting to rid Tripoli of Islamist-leaning armed groups, has received support from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, and, most recently, from Russian mercenaries, according to diplomats and Tripoli officials

Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russians' contributions of advanced capabilities -- everything from snipers to precision weaponry -- could be felt on the battlefield, boosting the morale of Haftar's forces.

""It's giving Haftar a real technological edge,"" said Wehrey, who recently returned from Libya.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in an interview with Reuters earlier this week, declined to comment directly on the drone but said he believed Russia was trying to ""put their finger on the scale"" in Libya's civil war to create a situation that was advantageous to Moscow.

Townsend voiced deep concern about Russia's growing role in the country, including how it would affect Libya's ""territorial sovereignty and AFRICOM's counter-terrorism mission.""

""This highlights the malign influence of Russian mercenaries acting to influence the outcome of the civil war in Libya, and who are directly responsible for the recent and sharp increase in fighting, casualties and destruction around Tripoli,"" Townsend said.

Mohammed Ali Abdallah, advisor for U.S. affairs in Libya's GNA, said the U.S. drone had come down near the pro-LNA stronghold of Tarhuna, 65km (40 miles) south-east of Tripoli.

More than 1,400 Russian mercenaries were deployed with the LNA, he said.

""Only the Russians have that ability - and they were operating where it happened,"" Abdallah said, in written comments sent to Reuters.

""It's our understanding that Haftar was asked by his Russian partners to claim responsibility, despite not having the capability or equipment to shoot down a US drone.""

9905642,2019-11-28,"ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognized government and Turkey have signed an agreement on maritime boundaries in the Mediterranean Sea that could complicate Ankara's disputes over energy exploration with other countries.

Turkey, which announced the accord and a deal on expanded security and military cooperation on Thursday, gave no details of their memorandum of understanding and did not specify where Turkish and Libyan waters meet.

Libya's neighbor Egypt dismissed the deal as ""illegal"", and Greece said any such accord would be geographically absurd because it ignored the presence of the Greek island of Crete between the coasts of Turkey and Libya.

Tensions are already running high between Athens and Ankara because of Turkish drilling in the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus, and the European Union has prepared sanctions against Turkey in response.

The dispute has left Ankara searching for allies in the region. The new agreements were signed at a meeting on Wednesday between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Fayez al-Serraj, the head of the Tripoli-based government which Ankara is backing against a rival military force based in eastern Libya.

""This means protecting Turkey's rights deriving from international law,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said of the memorandum of understanding on the ""delimitation of maritime jurisdictions"".

He said that such accords could be agreed with other countries if differences could be overcome and that Ankara was in favor of ""fair sharing"" of resources, including off Cyprus.

But Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said any maritime accord between Libya and Turkey ""ignores something that is blatantly obvious, which is that between those two countries there is the large geographical land mass of Crete.

""Consequently such an attempt borders on the absurd.""

Egypt, which has been at odds with Turkey since the Egyptian military overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013, condemned the deal as ""illegal and not binding or affecting the interests and the rights of any third parties"".

The internationally recognized government in Tripoli confirmed the new agreements but gave no details.

The government in eastern Libya, where rival political factions have been based since 2014, said the maritime accord was illegitimate.

The Turkish presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun tweeted on Thursday that the agreement will strengthen military ties with the Tripoli-based government.

Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival military and political camps based in the capital Tripoli and the east. Serraj's government is in conflict with forces led by Khalifa Haftar based in eastern Libya.

Haftar controls most of Libya's oil fields and facilities but oil revenues are controlled by the central bank in Tripoli.

In June, Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) said they had cut all ties with Turkey and that all Turkish commercial flights or ships trying to access Libya would be treated as hostile.

9905643,2019-05-04,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan state oil firm NOC called on Saturday for the safe return of the national head of the oil workers' labor union, Saad Dinar, who was abducted by an armed group on Monday near the eastern city of Benghazi.

""NOC is gravely concerned about Mr Dinar's wellbeing. He has not been seen since his seizure,"" NOC said in a statement. Dinar is also a NOC staff member.

NOC is based in Tripoli in the west of Libya, home to the internationally recognized government. Benghazi is controlled by the forces of commander Khalifa Haftar, who last month launched an offensive to take the capital.

Reuters was unable to reach eastern authorities for comment.

A source close to Dinar's family said he was driven to an unknown location by people who seized him at around midnight on April 29 near his home in Suluq, close to Benghazi.

Relations deteriorated last week between NOC, which handles oil and gas exports for the whole of Libya, and Haftar's forces.

Last week, NOC said several Libyan warships had used the oil port of Ras Lanuf, and that military personnel had entered the nearby Es Sider terminal. It did not say who was responsible, but the two terminals, Libya's biggest oil export ports, are controlled by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) force.

The LNA said last week that it had sent a warship to Ras Lanuf for a ""training mission"".

A spokesman for NOC told Reuters last week that the firm was ""concerned by renewed attempts to divide the corporation"" and was ""particularly alarmed by evidence of staff coercion.""

9905644,2019-04-10,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Western diplomats sat down for three hours with Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar in his eastern stronghold last month to try to dissuade him from launching an offensive against the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.

They urged him not to plunge the country into a civil war and told him he could become a successful civilian leader if he committed himself to pursuing a political settlement, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting outside Benghazi.

But Haftar, a military strongman who critics describe as the new Muammar Gaddafi, paid them little heed, said the sources who spoke on condition the ambassadors were not identified. He said he was prepared to negotiate with the prime minister, but if no power-sharing deal was reached, he could invade the capital.

Two weeks later, on April 4, he sent troops from his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) streaming towards Tripoli - just at a time when U.N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the city to prepare for a national reconciliation conference this month which Guterres' aides thought Haftar supported.

For world powers including France, Italy and Britain, the general's military campaign, the biggest in Libya since the 2011 uprising that deposed Gaddafi, represented a major setback.

They had tried for years to co-opt Haftar, 75, into a political settlement that would stabilize the major oil and gas producer after almost a decade of conflict that had acted as a breeding ground for Islamist militancy.

Even the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which have backed Haftar and see him as a bulwark against Islamists in north Africa, appear to have been surprised by his rapid advance. A French diplomatic source said Paris, which has also aided the general, had no prior warning of the offensive.

The diplomats' calls for military restraint in the meeting last month had echoed those from other Western and U.N. envoys who had traveled to Haftar's base outside the city of Benghazi in the preceding weeks, four separate diplomatic sources said.

In a sign of how far the situation in Libya - and Haftar - was beyond their control, U.N. and Western envoys in daily contact with his camp about the conference had no idea he was about to launch the offensive, the four diplomatic sources said.

Some even thought the general was bluffing.

""These are just psycho games,"" one U.N. official texted Reuters when the first LNA troops were spotted south of Tripoli.

Some diplomats who had met Haftar many times and lobbied their governments to overlook his hardline comments - such as that Libya was not ready for democracy - despaired when it became clear he was committed to taking the city by force.

""I've wasted almost two years on Haftar,"" said one who met Haftar regularly. ""If the national conference doesn't happen, it was for nothing.""

Haftar, for his part, has been consistent in speeches and statements about his commitment to military force in his declared mission to restore order to the north African country and also dropped hints about ultimately ruling the country.

When he first announced his intentions in February 2014 he stood in front of a map of Libya, a somber-looking, gray-haired man wearing an immaculate army uniform, and vowed to stage a coup.

Western countries left Libya after fighting in Tripoli in 2014, closing embassies and ending NATO training programs, before returning in 2016.

Their period of absence opened the door for Arab countries such as Egypt and the UAE, which provided training and military assistance, according to reports from U.N. experts monitoring an arms embargo imposed on Libya in 2011, and diplomats.

Haftar's forces received aircraft as well as military vehicles from the UAE, which had also built up an air base at Al Khadim, allowing the LNA to gain air superiority by 2016, a U.N. report said in June 2017.

But on the ground Haftar was struggling to make progress in his initial campaign launched in May 2014 against Islamist militants in Benghazi, which he dubbed ""Operation Dignity"". His heavy guns and aircraft flattened residential buildings but could not dislodge the foreign jihadists holed up in booby-trapped houses.

It was at this point that France, which has oil assets in eastern Libya and is politically close to the UAE and Egypt, offered assistance, according to Libyan and French sources.

In late 2015, Paris sent military advisers and special forces familiar in urban warfare who camped out at an air base near Benghazi, the sources said. The French assistance helped turn the tide and allowed him to declare victory in Benghazi in 2017, they added.

Arab countries had recognized Haftar as Libya's official army commander for years but France helped him gain further international legitimacy as his campaign progressed.

In 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron received Haftar and the U.N.-backed Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Serraj, on the outskirts of Paris to try to persuade them to make a deal, which instantly upgraded the general's diplomatic status.

Macron and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian see Haftar, much like Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, as a buffer against Islamist militants in north Africa, according to French officials.

Le Drian has been to Libya three times in two years and on his last trip, on March 20, he saw Serraj in Tripoli and then traveled east to see Haftar to try to broker a detente.

According to a French diplomatic source, when Haftar asked him why he hadn't come for such a long time, Le Drian responded: ""We were waiting for your victories.""

He was referring to the general's campaign to take the south of the country earlier this year, the source said.

Following Haftar's Tripoli advance, Egypt's Sisi stressed the need for urgent international action to stop the situation deteriorating, without naming the LNA offensive. The governments of France, Italy, the UAE, Britain and the United States said in a joint statement they were deeply concerned about the fighting.

Le Drian told lawmakers on Tuesday that France feared more serious conflict, adding that Haftar and Serraj needed to agree on a ceasefire before resuming their dialogue.

The UAE mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. reports of military aid to Haftar. Egyptian officials also had no immediate comment on the reports.

Haftar was among officers who helped Gaddafi rise to power in 1969 but fell out with him during Libya's war with Chad in the 1980s. Haftar was taken prisoner by the Chadians and had to be rescued by the CIA after having worked from Chad to overthrow Gaddafi.

He lived for around 20 years in the U.S. state of Virginia before returning home in 2011 to join other rebels in the uprising that ousted Gaddafi.

Three years later Haftar made his own move, launching the campaign in Benghazi.

At the time he had gathered only around 200 soldiers and 13 helicopters under his LNA banner, said Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute international relations think-tank in The Hague.

However Haftar quickly attracted other soldiers such as the Saiqa (Lightning) elite unit as well as tribesmen.

There is no reliable figure for the current size of the LNA, though analysts say it runs into the thousands. The Saiqa alone has 3,500 men and Haftar's sons also have well-equipped units.

Haftar's forces outnumber his opponents scattered in different western cities but he has filled his ranks beyond a core of former Gaddafi soldiers with less trained tribesmen and Salafist fighters and foreign mercenaries, analysts say.

After Benghazi, Haftar gradually took control of the entire east of Libya, before turning his attention to the south.

However this month's Tripoli offensive is the commander's highest-stakes gamble yet.

He has moved much of his forces west, leaving his eastern home base exposed, and making it almost impossible for him to retreat without losing standing among friends and foes alike.

The battle for the capital is still raging, and little is certain. Some pro-Haftar media had predicted victory in 48 hours but the fighting is still mostly outside the city.

Meanwhile, his lightning drive has united opponents in western Libya who had not talked to each other for a long time but have now joined arms.

""Although none of the foreign sponsors behind Haftar is likely pleased with the dramatic deterioration, they have no option but to continue backing him,"" said Harchaoui. ""They have been concentrating most of their bets on one key figure for almost half a decade. This cannot be walked back overnight.""",Reuters,libya,,[],How Libya's Haftar blindsided world powers with advance on Tripoli,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-haftar-insight-idUSKCN1RM0PJ,None,
9905712,2019-09-16,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces on Monday mounted an air strike on the central city of Sirte held by the internationally recognised government, an official and residents said, widening a conflict engulfing the capital Tripoli.

Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) force has been trying since April to take Tripoli, which is held by the internationally recognised government, with a ground campaign supported by air strikes.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people in Tripoli alone, killed hundreds of civilians, and risks disrupting oil supplies from the country in chaos since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

There have been LNA-claimed strikes in recent days on Sirte, some 450km (280 miles) by road east of Tripoli, but mainly on the outskirts, residents said.

Haftar, who is allied to an eastern parallel administration, might be trying to shift the frontline from Sirte away from Tripoli where he has been unable to breach the city's defences and even lost his main forward base in Gharyan, said Emad Badi, a Libya researcher.

Such a move would also pre-empt attacks on the main LNA supply base in Jufra, a central oasis, which the Tripoli forces have attacked by air, said Badi, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute.

The Sirte strike hit a building near a feedstock plant where the a local force securing Sirte is based, which an LNA official said had been targeted.

The Tripoli-based government also said on Facebook that drones operated by the United Arab Emirates had carried out strikes against the positions of a force allied to it.

The UAE has been backing the LNA alongside Egypt, according to U.N. reports, but neither country has confirmed this. Turkey is backing the Tripoli forces.

Mitiga airport, the only working airport in Tripoli, was also targeted in the early hours of Monday, an eastern military source told Reuters. It has been closed for two weeks due to continued air strikes.

Haftar and his backers say they are trying to free the capital from armed groups which they blame for destabilising Libya since the fall of Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising.

Haftar's critics accuse him of trying to seize power through a military coup, deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and west of the sprawling North African country.

Sirte, Gaddafi's birth place, was a stronghold for Islamic State militants until Tripoli-forces backed by U.S. airstrikes expelled the group in December 2016.

The coastal city lies at the unofficial border of areas of influence of the Tripoli forces in western Libya and the LNA controlling the east.

The LNA suffered a setback when two commanders of an allied force in the town of Tarhouna southeast of Tripoli got killed late on Friday.

Tarhouna is the main forward base from where arms and troops arrive from the east after the force lost Gharyan, a town some 70 km south of Tripoli, late in June.

9905714,2019-04-25,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Eastern Libya commander Khalifa Haftar has thrown much of his military forces into attacking Tripoli, but the outcome of the offensive could be determined by a separate battle -- to keep open the parallel finance system that funds his soldiers.

Mobilizing Libya's biggest military campaign since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Haftar has advanced on the U.N.-backed administration in the capital from a bastion in the east, where he has a parallel government and central bank branch.

The general has funded his eastern state with a mix of unofficial bonds, Russia-printed cash and deposits from eastern banks, accumulating debt worth around 35 billion Libyan dinars ($25.18 billion) outside the official banking system.

But diplomats and banking sources say that those sources of support might be closing, as the Tripoli-based central bank, which controls the country's energy revenues, has taken steps to curtail the operations of banks in the east.

Those banks have in recent months struggled to meet minimum deposit requirements, which could give the Tripoli central bank allied to Tripoli Premier Fayez al-Serraj the excuse to shut off access to hard currency, they said.

""There is a looming banking crisis that could undermine eastern authorities' ability to fund themselves in the near future,"" said Claudia Gazzini, senior Libya analyst at International Crisis Group.

""The crisis was already in the making before the war broke out.""

Haftar has built up his Libyan National Army (LNA) with the help of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt supplying heavy gear such helicopters, according to U.N. reports.

But Gulf countries such as the UAE have preferred not to give cash directly to Haftar, fearing it will end up being used for the wrong purposes, several diplomatic sources told Reuters.

That has forced the septuagenarian leader to use merchants to import vehicles and other gear, using hard currency obtained from the Tripoli central bank and paid out by eastern commercial banks issuing letters of credit, military sources said.

There is no public data on the costs of Haftar's war, but he has sent more than 1,000 troops west plus support staff like drivers or medics, military sources and residents said.

Fuel is not a problem, costing just 0.15 dinars a liter, with state oil firm NOC serving the whole country.

But in its attempt to capture Tripoli the LNA has used hundreds of vehicles, with convoys going west non-stop from Benghazi, carrying anything from soldiers to ammunition to food.

In addition, every day two flights with Russian-made transport planes go from Benghazi to Jufrah in central Libya, his main base. Seriously wounded soldiers are flown to Tunisia.

The offensive has stalled, and so the LNA has vowed to move in yet more troops.

Haftar's finances face another potential vulnerability.

In November, the House of Representatives allied to Haftar approved a law to set up a military investment authority which gives the LNA control -- like in Egypt -- of parts of the economy including civilian activities such as scrap metal.

The investment vehicle's companies are exempted from taxes and import duties, as part of a welfare state envisaged by Haftar, but they need banks to deal with partners abroad and expand their businesses, analysts say.

""If the banks fail, Haftar's welfare state will come under pressure,"" said a Western diplomat.

Functioning banks are also needed for Haftar's parallel government to pay salaries and serve an LNA support network, analysts say. The central bank in Tripoli covers some public salaries in eastern Libya but not LNA soldiers hired after 2014 when the country split into western and eastern administrations.

The Tripoli central bank has already cut three eastern banks from Libya's electronic banking system to curb their operations. Lenders have still been able to get hard currency via other banks but in a further step the Tripoli central bank might shut access completely, diplomats and business sources said.

The Tripoli central bank (CBL) has vowed to stay neutral and but diplomats say it is also helping Serraj, approving his plans to allocate some 2 billion dinars for his own war effort.

CBL did not respond to mailed questions.

There has been a banking crisis building up all across Libya and especially in the east, where three eastern banks have struggled to keep a required 20 percent of customers' deposits at the Tripoli central bank: They have been paying out more hard currency in recent months, but need to balance accounts.

""Their deposits with CBL have fallen short of their statutory minimum requirements,"" Husni Bey, a prominent business leader and owner of HB group.

Data received by Reuters confirmed his.

Diplomats do not expect Tripoli central bank governor Sadiq al-Kabir to shut eastern banks completely as this would pose risks for western lenders. The same banks operate in the west and east with money flows hard to differentiate.

But they fear the longer the conflict lasts, the harder it will be to unify the central banks and repay debt.

The west has piled up debt of 68 billion dinars, bringing Libya's total deficit and public debt to 130 billion, including unpaid state obligations such as social insurance, said Bey.

The biggest worry among diplomats is that Haftar, who surprised world powers with his offensive, might try selling crude from oilfields and ports, bypassing NOC.

""If the offensive fails, Haftar might do this as he feels encouraged by (U.S. President Donald) Trump,"" said one Western diplomat.

9905716,2019-02-06,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces loyal to Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar captured the El-Sharara oilfield on Wednesday, officials said, apparently taking over the facility from armed tribesmen and state guards in a challenge to the Tripoli government.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) group, which is based in the east, called oil firm NOC to lift force majeure, a contractual waiver, it had declared when it shut down production at the 315,000-barrels a day oilfield.

NOC declined to comment.

El Sharara was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds.

The LNA said it had met no resistance.

Libya's oil industry has faced disruption since unrest began, with rival power centers in the west and east. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure.

Haftar is a dominant figure in the east where his Libyan National Army (LNA) seized the second-largest city of Benghazi in 2017 by expelling Islamist and other fighters.

Last month, his forces started an offensive in the south to fight militants and secure its oilfields, and on Wednesday made good on the promise by moving on the El Sharara field.

""Our forces arrived safely at the field,"" a spokesman for the forces, Ahmed Mismari, told a news conference.

A video posted online showed jubilant soldiers at the oilfield which is located deep in Libya's south and had been previously formally belonged to the Tripoli-based internationally recognized government.

A resident confirmed LNA solders were inside the oil field, a vast complex stretching for kilometers.

A Tripoli official, asking not to be named, acknowledged that the LNA was holding El Sharara.

Tripoli had earlier on Wednesday appointed a military commander for the main southern city of Sabha and there were unconfirmed reports that Tripoli would dispatch a force to secure El Sharara.

Haftar's forces are allied to a parallel administration based in eastern Libya. His LNA faction last month started a military offensive in eastern Libya to fight militants and secure the region's oilfields.

An executive at NOC unit AGOCO, citing OMV, said on Twitter the El-Sharara the oilfield could reopen in March. NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor.

The eastern government is allied to Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army (LNA) launched a campaign this month in southwestern Libya. Sabha had been nominally under the control of the internationally recognised government in Tripoli but in reality was run by local groups including tribes.

Control of Sabha is seen as vital for securing southern Libya's oilfields, one of the stated goals of the LNA campaign.

The interior, health and junior justice ministers of the eastern government, which is based in Benghazi, were seen meeting local officials in the municipality of Sabha in pictures sent to Reuters by members of the visiting delegation.

There was no immediate comment from Tripoli on the visit, which further highlighted the internationally recognised government's continued lack of authority in most of Libya.

The LNA has secured Sabha airport and other strategic sites in the area in recent days, after local groups handed them over without a fight.

The LNA says its campaign is aimed at combating militant groups and securing oil facilities in the south, which include El Sharara oilfield, Libya's biggest.

On Monday LNA forces killed a suspected al Qaeda fighter called Adel Ahmed al-Abdaly when they stormed his house in Sabha, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said. Otherwise the city has been largely quiet since the arrival of the LNA.

9905789,2019-09-26,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Major powers sought to bury their differences over Libya at the United Nations on Thursday after six months of war that has plunged the oil producing nation into crisis with few signs of a peace efforts bearing fruit.

Libya's conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers, which have been backing various armed groups since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. The former rebels have been fighting each other since then.

Egypt, along with the United Arab Emirates, is a supporter of Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libya National Army (LNA) has been trying to take Tripoli from forces allied with the internationally recognized government (GNA). Turkey and Qatar both back the GNA.

Those nations, including Italy, Germany and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - which also have rivalries in Libya, met to break the deadlock and enable a U.N. peace plan to move ahead.

""The idea is to put a form of political pressure on all the main actors that support the factions and say 'Stop the military competition and proxy war and get around the table,'"" said a European diplomatic source.

The meeting is the first major diplomatic push since eastern forces loyal to Haftar in April launched an offensive to take Tripoli, held by the internationally recognized government of Premier Fayez al-Serraj.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people and derailed years of U.N peace efforts but gone nowhere as Haftar's forces have been unable to breach Tripoli's southern suburbs.

U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame last month unveiled plans for an international conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground.

Germany has offered to host that conference by the end of the year, although no date has been fixed.

""The idea is to get a number of key players on the same page, to move the process forward, to support Ghassan Salame and his calls for a ceasefire, for bringing the international community together and then eventually an intra-Libyan dialogue,"" a senior U.N. official said.

Salame thinks Germany can mediate, as it is seen as impartial in the conflict, in contrast to France and Italy, which jointly hosted Thursday's meeting but have been competing for influence in Libya.

Both countries brought Haftar and Serraj, along with regional players, together at summits in Paris and Palermo last year, but failed to achieve a breakthrough.

""Haftar's war attempt to forcefully enter Tripoli is about to reach the 180-day mark, and it still hasn't succeeded,"" Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute said.

""As a result, several states now wish to use the diplomatic space in a way that protects their own agenda with regard to Libya.""

9905790,2019-09-24,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Egypt and Qatar, who support rival groups in the Libyan conflict, traded barbs at the United Nations on Tuesday, highlighting just how difficult it will be for the U.N. to push renewed peace efforts.

Libya's conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers, which have been backing various armed groups since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. The former rebels have been fighting each other since then.

Egypt, along with the United Arab Emirates, is a supporter of Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libya National Army (LNA) has been trying to take Tripoli from forces allied with the internationally recognized government (GNA). Turkey and Qatar both back the GNA.

Without naming countries specifically, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi told delegates at the U.N. General Assembly that there had to be a concerted effort to stop militias taking control of Libya and preventing support form external actors.

""We need to work on unifying all national institutions in order to save our dear neighbor from the ensuing chaos by militias and prevent the intervention of external actors in Libya's internal affairs,"" Sisi said in a speech.

Haftar's forces started a campaign in April with a ground offensive supported by air strikes and his backers have repeatedly labeled militias in Tripoli as terrorist groups.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people in Tripoli alone, killed hundreds of civilians, and risks disrupting oil supplies from Libya.

""This conflict needs to be stopped. It is time to take a bold and decisive stand to address the root causes of the Libyan crisis comprehensively and can be achieved by fully committing to the United Nations plan,"" Sisi said.

But addressing the same delegates shortly after, Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, accused Haftar's forces of carrying out war crimes with impunity and with the support of countries that were undermining the GNA and U.N. peace efforts.

""The latest military operations on the capital Tripoli have thwarted the holding of the comprehensive Libyan national conference,"" al-Thani said.

""There is an internationally recognized settlement, but certain countries say they formally participate in international efforts on one hand and then undermine these efforts on another hand by supporting warlords and terrorist militias for their narrow interests against the legitimate government,"" he said.

Doha and Cairo's differences were being openly voiced weeks after U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame unveiled plans for an international conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground, without naming a venue.

Germany emerged as a possible location with Berlin trying to put it together by October.

Salame believes Germany can mediate because it is seen as impartial in the conflict in contrast to France and Italy, which have been competing for influence.

France and Italy have oil and gas interests in Libya and have been accused of also backing protagonists in the conflict.

Both countries brought Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, along with regional players, together in Paris and Palermo last year, but failed to achieve a breakthrough.

The two will host a ministerial meeting of countries involved in the Libyan conflict at the U.N. on Thursday, with the aim to bridge differences between all sides.

The plans, which are still in the early stages according to diplomats, are the first major diplomatic push since eastern forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar launched in April an offensive to take the capital Tripoli, held by the internationally recognized government of Premier Fayez al-Serraj.

The campaign has displaced more than 120,000 people and derailed years of U.N peace efforts but gone nowhere as Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) has been unable to breach Tripoli's southern suburbs.

U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame last month unveiled plans for an international Libya conference to bring together foreign powers backing rival groups on the ground, without naming a venue.

""Germany therefore initiated a consultation process with key international partners. With sufficient preparatory work these efforts could lead toward a meaningful international event this fall,"" Oliver Owcza, Germany's ambassador to Libya, said on Twitter.

He gave no details on the event announced just after German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament the situation in the north African country risked destabilizing the whole of Africa.

Diplomatic sources said the event would be held in Berlin in October or November.

Libya's conflict has increasingly become a proxy war between foreign powers which have been backing various armed group since the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi - the former rebels have been fighting each other since then.

Haftar, who is allied to a parallel government in the east, has for years enjoyed the military support of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, U.N. reports say.

Turkey has been backing Serraj and has been sending his forces combat drones and vehicles since the start of the war which has balanced out a military edge for the LNA, diplomats say.

Salame thinks Germany can mediate, as it is seen as impartial in the conflict in contrast to France and Italy, which have been competing for influence and have oil and gas interests in Libya, diplomats say.

Both countries brought Haftar and Serraj plus regional players together at summits in Paris and Palermo last year, but didn't achieve a breakthrough.

Germany has strong ties with Turkey and Egypt, whose bilateral ties have been strained since the Egyptian military, then led by Abdel al-Fattah al-Sisi, ousted the Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.

The conference's goal would be to push foreign players to enforce an existing arms embargo and for a ceasefire to allow Libyans to meet afterwards for political talks.

Key obstacles will be to get Turkey to sit with top officials from Egypt and the UAE, Western diplomats say.

9905793,2019-09-06,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya's state oil firm has restricted kerosene supplies to areas controlled by eastern commander Khalifa Haftar in what diplomats and oil officials said was an attempt to prevent his troops using them in their five-month-old battle to take the capital.

The reduction in volumes sent east in August was a reversal by state oil firm NOC, which works with internationally-backed authorities based in the capital Tripoli and also has to cooperate with Haftar's forces as they control major oilfields.

The NOC views itself as outside the almost decade-long struggle for control of the country and NOC data for the previous three months showed it had sharply increased supplies of kerosene to the east in response to demand.

""NOC has stopped all additional fuel supplies until such time that assurances can be met that fuel is only being used for domestic and civilian aviation purposes, and reflects real consumption,"" the NOC said in a statement alongside the data, which it sent to Reuters in response to a request.

The NOC data showed that kerosene supplies to airport warehouses in central and eastern areas which an NOC official said were controlled by the LNA fell to around 5.25 million liters in August.

The monthly figure had risen to between 7.3 million liters and 8.8 million liters in the previous three months, more than double the amounts recorded for January and February.

Two oil officials said on condition of anonymity that the NOC was concerned shipments were being used by the LNA in the Tripoli war. Two diplomats also said that was the reason for the reduction.

The figures do not distinguish between kerosene used for domestic heating and industrial purposes and that used for jet fuel but the statement said demand for the latter had gone up.

""Jet fuel demand has increased in the eastern part of the country despite the number of civilian flights remaining unchanged,"" the NOC statement said.

Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) force has been unable to breach Tripoli's southern defenses since it began its campaign in April, but the conflict has killed more than 100 civilians, displaced more than 120,000, and shows no signs of ending.

The August kerosene figure was still well above than the roughly 3.5 million liters the NOC sent to the east in January and February, showing the sensitivity of the issue for the civilian population and the limits of the Tripoli government's power.

Despite United Nations backing for the authorities in the capital, they have not been able to extend their reach across Libya, where a patchwork of rival armed groups filled the power vacuum left by the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The eastern-based LNA has support from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and some Western powers such as France see Haftar as a ""counter-terrorism"" force since he routed Islamists in the east.

In April U.S. President Donald Trump called him and ""recognized Field Marshal Haftar's significant role in fighting terrorism and securing Libya's oil resources, and the two discussed a shared vision for Libya's transition to a stable, democratic political system"", the White House said.

It would be unrealistic for the NOC leadership to side with U.N.-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and cut off the LNA completely, said Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague.

""The international environment overall is less supportive of (NOC chairman Mustafa) Sanallah now than a year ago,"" he said.

Several Libyan oil officials and Western diplomats said there were indications the east was trying to set up a new firm to import fuel, which would violate Libyan law, to supply troops camped near Tripoli, some 1,000 km from their Benghazi base.

The United Nations has in recent months stopped several attempts by the east to export oil via small firms based mainly in Dubai, which would have violated U.N. sanctions, they said.

""The creation of any new entity to export and import crude oil and petroleum products would violate Libyan and international law, under which NOC has the sole legal right to do so,"" the NOC spokesman said.

Abdel-Salam al-Badri, a deputy prime minister in the eastern government, denied attempts to export or import fuel. The head of a parallel NOC already set up by eastern leaders, Mabrouk Sultan, did not respond to repeated messages and calls.

Haftar has received military aid from Egypt and the UAE, according to U.N. reports, but has been struggling to fund his parallel administration. Tripoli's central bank only pays some of his public servants.

The LNA mainly uses drones but also planes from Gaddafi's army, and flies anything from ammunition to food and soldiers to air bases in Jufrah in central Libya and Brak in the south from where they continue their trip by road, diplomats say. A base in Zintan in western Libya is controlled by pro-LNA forces.

Commercial flights operate out of the east as well, but diverting jet fuel from them would be politically difficult because they are vital for medical care and business.

Forces allied to Serraj also get fuel from NOC. The NOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had restricted those supplies.

Serraj's allies are less fuel dependent than the LNA due to shorter supply lines, and they scaled back their air strikes after the LNA hit western airports.

On Wednesday, Tripoli's forces took Gharyan, south of the capital, which eastern forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar had used as their main supply base to attack Tripoli, home to the recognized administration.

Officials showed journalists weapons they said had been seized, among them sophisticated U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank missiles.

They also presented advanced Chinese-made laser-guided artillery shells, and said combat drones had been also been captured, in addition to some 150 prisoners.

Inscriptions on the Javelin missiles said they had originally belonged to the armed forces of the United Arab Emirates, one of Haftar's main backers.

U.N. reports have previously said that the UAE and Egypt have been arming Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) since 2014, but details have been unclear.

Oded Berkowitz, Israeli security analyst and deputy chief intelligence officer of the MAX consultancy, said it was the first time that Javelins had been sighted in the Libya conflict.

""The weapons themselves are highly advanced but wouldn't be a game changer in Libya,"" he said. ""The real political game changer is the fact that advanced U.S. systems were delivered to a third party, and this may push the U.S. to oppose the UAE and their support for the LNA.""

Haftar began his assault on Tripoli on April 4, surprising the United Nations, which had been preparing for a national conference to try to end the chaos gripping Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The takeover of Gharyan by Tripoli forces is a major blow to the eastern-based Libya National Army (LNA) led by Khalifa Haftar, which on April 4 started an offensive to take Tripoli from the internationally recognized administration.

The offensive has not advanced beyond Tripoli's southern suburbs, and the frontline had not changed significantly for weeks.

Gharyan was until Wednesday the main forward base for the LNA where troops, weapons and ammunition arrived from the East. The LNA began its Tripoli campaign here.

Forces allied to the Tripoli government, backed by air strikes, stormed the town, some 90 km (56 miles) south of Tripoli, in the morning in a surprise attack, witnesses said.

They took the central operations room of the LNA, which by evening had left the town, they added. Gharyan is also home to field hospitals and there is a helicopter base outside the town.

The Tripoli-based Presidential Council in charge of the government said in a statement Gharyan had been fully ""liberated"".

One of its members, Mohammed al-Ammari, warned in a separate statement against any revenge attacks.

The LNA still holds the town of Tarhouna southeast of Tripoli, its second main position in the campaign.

""This is a game changer,"" said Tarek Megerisi, a policy fellow with the North Africa and Middle East program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

""If Haftar can't retake it quickly (which is doubtful) Tarhouna and the remaining LNA units will be more isolated, under resourced and with lower morale,"" he said.

There was no immediate comment from the LNA, whose spokesman Ahmed Mismari had hours earlier said that an attack by Tripoli forces had been repelled.

Haftar and his backers say they are trying to free the capital from militias which they blame for destabilizing Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.

Haftar's critics accuse him of trying to seize power through force and deepening a conflict between factions based in the east and west of the sprawling North African country.

9905797,2019-06-14,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - France's Total and other foreign firms have started to renew their business licenses with Libya's internationally recognized government to keep operating in the country, the Tripoli-based economy minister told Reuters.

The comments by Ali Abdulaziz Issawi could appease Western concerns the Tripoli government will try to suspend oil and other firms as it fights for survival against an offensive by the eastern military forces of Khalifa Haftar

In May, the economy ministry suspended Total and 39 other foreign firms, saying their licenses had expired, before granting a grace period of three months to seek new ones.

Some diplomats and analysts saw the move as political pressure aimed at shoring up support abroad against an assault by Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA), which has been trying for more than two months to take the capital Tripoli.

Issawi denied a political motive, saying some firms had operated without a license for a long time.

""There are companies working now on renewing their licenses in Libya,"" he said, adding Total was among them.

He added that if a license did not get renewed, ""there are several oil companies to take (over) the oilfields in 24 hours. There is a lot of competition.""

Other firms required to renew their licenses include French aerospace firm Thales, German engineering firm Siemens, telecoms equipment firm Alcatel-Lucent, now owned by Finland's Nokia, and Microsoft. Total is most exposed, with oil operations on the ground.

Issawi also said Libya's oil production was around 1.25 million barrels a day, in line with previously reported levels.

Libya has been riven by conflict since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with the country now broadly split between eastern-based forces under Haftar and the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, in the west, under Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.

Still, with Haftar's forces unable to pierce defenses in Tripoli's southern suburbs, business activities continue in much of the capital and western coastal towns.

Issawi said ports and imports were working normally, adding Libya had four months of wheat reserves.

The most noticeable impact of the conflict was a rise in some food prices, such as vegetables, as farms are located in southern Tripoli where the battle is raging.

Issawi said the government, which controls little territory beyond the greater capital region, would not incur new debt to fund the war, sticking to plans for a deficit-free 2019 budget.

Tripoli derives revenue from oil and gas exports, interest-free loans from local banks to the central bank, and a 183 percent surcharge on foreign exchange transactions conducted at official rates.

Some analysts expect Serraj's government will be forced to raise new debt if the war for control of Tripoli drags on.

With Libya dominated by armed factions, the public wage bill has soared as fighters have been made public employees to buy their loyalty.

9905798,2019-05-25,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Heavy fighting raged in the Libyan capital on Saturday as eastern forces made a new push to advance inside the city controlled by the internationally recognized government.

The Libya National Army (LNA) force of Khalifa Haftar, who is allied to a parallel government in the east, started an offensive to take Tripoli almost two months ago but has not breached the city's southern defenses.

The LNA made a new push on Saturday morning, trying to advance on a road from the former airport - located in a southern suburb - towards the center but there was no sign of progress, residents said.

Fighting had slowed in recent weeks during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan when most people fast during the day until sunset.

The battle for Tripoli has killed at least 510 people, forced 75,000 out of their homes, trapped thousands of migrants in detention centers, and flattened some southern suburbs. It has also forced closures of schools, split families on different sides of the front line, and brought power cuts.

Two ambulance workers were killed and three wounded on Thursday when their ambulance cars were hit, the World Health Organization said. It did not say who was responsible.

The United Nations has been unable to negotiate a ceasefire. France has, like other European countries, called for a ceasefire but also supported Haftar as a way to fight Islamist militants in the country.

On Wednesday, Haftar, meeting French President Emmanuel Macron, ruled out a ceasefire and said he wanted to rid the capital of militias that had ""infested"" the U.N.-backed government of Premier Fayez al-Serraj, a French presidential official said.",Reuters,libya,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'France']",Heavy fighting in Libyan capital,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-idUSKCN1SV0NA,None,
9905799,2019-05-20,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Gunmen have cut off the main water pipeline to Libya's besieged capital, Tripoli, spelling more misery for residents already reeling from weeks of fighting.

The United Nations said the water blockage was a possible war crime as Libya's internationally recognized government accused forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, which have been trying to capture Tripoli, of being behind the blockage.

The group on Sunday raided a station of the Great Man-Made River Project, a pipe network supplying ground water from the Sahara, the company said. The gunmen forced employees to turn off the pipes at the installation 400 km (250 miles) south of Tripoli.

The eastern forces of Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) launched an assault on Tripoli in early April and are bogged down in southern suburbs by fighters loyal to the U.N.-backed government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.

In past attacks on the pipeline, which was one of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi's few development projects, it has taken up to two days for households to notice water shortages in the coastal city of 2.5 million people.

The Tripoli government blamed a group that also cut the water supplies in 2017, saying its commander, Khalifa Ehnaish, belonged to Haftar's forces.

The LNA denied that. Ehnaish could not be reached.

""Considering this was a closure of the valves in an LNA-controlled area, the complicity of Ehnaish with the LNA in orchestrating this cannot be discounted,"" said Emad Badi, a non-resident scholar with the Middle East Institute.

9905800,2019-05-09,"TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognized government asked 40 foreign firms including French oil major Total to renew their licenses or have their operations suspended, pressuring Europe to stop an eastern military offensive against Tripoli.

The firms have three months to renew their licenses, the economy and industry ministry said in a decree, after an official earlier said their operations had been suspended.

The ministry cited legal procedures, but the action comes as the Tripoli-based government seeks to drum up support to fend off an assault by Khalifa Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) force, which has been trying for one month to take the capital.

Tripoli is home to the recognized administration but some European countries such as France have also supported eastern military commander Haftar as a way to fight militants in a country in chaos since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The general also enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

The decree was published a day after Tripoli prime minister Fayez al-Serraj met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, coming from Berlin and Rome, to bolster his case.

Macron had called for a ceasefire but with the condition attached that all armed groups -- including those helping Serraj defend the capital -- be monitored.

Haftar also would not have to withdraw his troops east, allowing him to book a huge territorial gain, which upset the Serraj government, said Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague.

""Officially, those 40 licenses were scheduled to be expiring now,"" he said. ""In reality, the decree is motivated by a desire to show European states that their leniency towards the eastern-Libyan faction has immediate consequences on their economic interests.""

Total, with large-scale oil and gas interests in Libya, is the only company on the list known to have extensive dealings there. Others include French aerospace firm Thales, German engineering firm Siemens and telecoms equipment firm Alcatel-Lucent, now owned by Finland's Nokia.

Last month, the Tripoli-based interior ministry suspended security cooperation with France, accusing Paris of backing Haftar, a commander from the east of the country where a rival government holds sway.

Highlighting France's apparently complex position, the foreign minister of Haftar's eastern parallel government visited France, though it was not immediately clear whether any French officials had received him.

In the capital Tripoli, three rockets hit a western suburb overnight close to the heavily fortified U.N. compound but otherwise there was less fighting than last week as life slowed down with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The United Nations has failed to broker a ceasefire after the offensive took it by surprise. Its special envoy Ghassan Salame has mostly stayed on the ground but his mission has reduced staffing levels, U.N. officials say.

One senior health worker was severely wounded as he traveled in an ambulance car in a southern Tripoli district that was reportedly attacked by Haftar-affiliated fighters, the U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA said in a statement.

European countries including Italy and France have taken a strong interest in Libya, both because of its natural resources and because of its status as the main departure point for migrants attempting to enter Europe across the Mediterranean. European countries have backed Libyan efforts that have succeeded in reducing the numbers attempting the journey.

Two boats carrying 214 migrants were intercepted by the Libyan coast guard late on Wednesday and taken back to the shore, the U.N. migration agency said.

""As clashes continue in the capital, we are concerned about the return and arbitrary detention of migrants in #Libya,"" the International Organization for Migration said in a tweet.

IOM spokesman Joel Millman said the 107 people on the first boat included 12 women and seven children, while the 107 people on the second boat were all men, 92 of them Sudanese, and there had been no reports of missing people or bodies retrieved.

9905803,2019-04-13,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces will pursue their advance on the capital Tripoli, the head of the eastern parliament in the divided country said on Saturday, despite international calls for a halt in an offensive that risks causing many civilian casualties.

His comments came as more clashes rocked the southern outskirts of Tripoli, where eastern forces have been confronted by groups allied to Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's internationally recognized government.

The European Union last week urged the eastern Libya National Army (LNA) to stop its attacks, having agreed on a statement after France and Italy sparred over how to handle the conflict.

But the eastern parliament head said they would press an offensive launched a week ago under military commander Khalifa Haftar, the latest outbreak of a cycle of conflict since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

""We need to get rid of militias and terrorist groups,"" Aguila Saleh, head of the House of Representatives allied to Haftar, said using a reference eastern officials often make to describe forces allied to the Tripoli government, which relies on support from several armed groups.

""We assure the residents of Tripoli that the campaign to liberate Tripoli will be limited and not violate any freedoms but restore security and fight terrorism,"" Saleh told lawmakers in a session in the main eastern city of Benghazi.

Forces loyal to al-Serraj's government have so far kept the eastern offensive at bay. Fierce fighting has broken out around a disused former airport about 11 km (7 miles) from the center and an eastern military source said a warplane belonging to the LNA had struck a military camp in an eastern Tripoli suburb.

Saley also said the United Nations mission to Libya and Serraj's government had been controlled by armed groups and had failed to expel them from the capital, and promised Libya would hold long-delayed elections after the Tripoli operation ends.

Haftar's offensive had surprised the United Nations, which had been planning to hold a national conference on April 14 to prepare Libya for elections.

The latest battle had by Friday killed 75 people, mainly fighters but including 17 civilians, and wounded another 323, according to U.N. tallies. Some 13,625 people have been forced out of their homes.

As well as the humanitarian cost, the conflict threatens to disrupt oil supplies, boost migration to Europe, scupper a U.N. peace plan, and allow Islamist militants to exploit the chaos.

9905805,2019-03-09,"TRIPOLI, March 9 (Reuters) - The airport in the Libyan capital Tripoli was closed on Saturday due to an unidentified drone flying in the area, the airport's director said.

Residents have repeatedly spotted drones flying over Tripoli in the past few days but the reason is not clear.

Flights from Tripoli's Matiga airport have been halted until further notice, said its director Lutfi al-Tayeb.

People in the capital have been on edge due to rumours that the eastern-based Libya National Army (LNA) loyal to Khalifa Haftar might seek to take it after gaining control of much of the south.

Haftar has not said he wants to march on Tripoli but a LNA website carried an unsourced report this week saying it could happen, adding that the LNA was working with people inside the city.

The United Nations, alarmed about the possibility of a military escalation, is mediating between Haftar, who is allied to a parallel government in the east, and Tripoli premier Fayez al-Serraj who heads the U.N.-backed administration.

The United Nations had planned for the North African oil producer to hold elections on Dec. 10 as a way out of conflict since the toppling of late leader Muammar Gaddafi but a spike in violence and lack of understanding between its rival camps had made this impossible.

Libya is divided into a recognized government in Tripoli and a parallel version in the east backed by Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control the east.

Last week, Serraj met with Haftar in Abu Dhabi but few details had emerged so far. He said in a speech in Tripoli he had agreed with Haftar to hold elections by year end.

He said he had met Haftar ""in order to stop bloodshed, reach a formula of avoiding our country's conflict and military escalation.""

9905807,2019-02-14,"DERNA, Libya (Reuters) - With artillery fire rumbling in the distance, residents of Derna gathered in a streetside cafe on Saturday to discuss the future of their city, long a jihadist hotbed in eastern Libya.

Libya National Army (LNA) soldiers did not declare final victory until the following day over the Islamist militants whose rules had determined life in the city since strongman Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.

But for owner Saif and his cappucino-drinking customers, the talk was already all about what should happen next with more jobs, above all to keep youngsters out of the militants' clutches, the top priority for many.

""Seventy percent of residents are unemployed,"" he said. ""We need an economic program.""

In a city notorious for having sent Islamist militants to Afghanistan and Syria and where citizens were prevented from voting in the 2014 national election, public services have been deteriorating for years.

""We want better state services, health and schools,"" said Hafez, who runs a workshop.

Derna has had just one small hospital since 2011 and supplies are limited.

""We only have 120 beds instead of the 520 in the old hospital,"" said its assistant director, Adel Adwal, during a tour of the building. Only one, old X-ray machine is still functioning, but ""it can break down any moment,"" he said.

Libya's eastern government, which oppose the internationally recognized administration in Tripoli, has allocated 100 million dinars ($72 million) to restart public services, said city mayor Abdelmoneim Gheithi.

He was appointed by the LNA, which supports the eastern government.

Much of Derna's old city, where the militants made their last stand and a source said the Red Crescent found 35 bodies, has been reduced to rubble.

In the newer part of the city, which Reuters was able to visit, life appeared to be returning to normal. But appearances were in part deceptive.

Hundreds of families have fled to western Libya, residents say, fearing persecution after being accused of having supported the Islamists.

The United Nations said the humanitarian situation in Derna was of grave concern, with reports of scores of civilians cut off from access to food, water and healthcare.

It was monitoring closely reports of summary executions and had also heard of arbitrary detentions, with 2,000 people said to be held in one prison alone.

The eastern army's chief of staff, Abdel-Razeq Nathouri, rejected that figure, but said any soldiers who had committed crimes would face trial.

Another resident said the LNA had acted to prevent abuses such as lootings blamed on auxiliary tribal forces but reconciliation would take time as some wanted revenge for having suffered under the Islamists.

9905863,2019-12-22,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will increase its military support to the internationally recognized government of Libya if necessary and it will evaluate ground, air and marine options, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday, after the two sides signed a military cooperation accord last month.

Turkey backs Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, which has been torn by factional conflict since 2011, and has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a report by U.N. experts seen by Reuters last month.

Turkey has also said it could deploy troops to Libya if the GNA makes such a request. The GNA has been fighting a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces based in the east of the country. Haftar's forces have received support from Russia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.

""If necessary, we will increase the military aspect of our support to Libya, and evaluate all our options, from the ground, air and sea,"" Erdogan said at an event in the northern province of Kocaeli.

Speaking before Erdogan, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey will stand by Libya's government until peace, stability and security are established in the country.

Last month, Turkey and the GNA signed an agreement to boost military cooperation and a separate deal on maritime boundaries, which has enraged Greece. Ankara and Athens have been at odds over hydrocarbon resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus.

While Greece has said the accord violates international law, Turkey has rejected those accusations, saying it aims to protect its rights in the eastern Mediterranean. On Sunday, Erdogan said Turkey will ""absolutely"" not turn back from its agreements with Libya.

""Nobody should come to us with attempts to exclude us, trap us in our own shores or steal our economic interests,"" Erdogan said. ""We have no intention of starting conflicts with anyone for no reason, or robbing anyone of their rights,"" he said.

""Those who oppose us have no sense of rights, law, justice, ethics or mercy,"" Erdogan said, referring to Greece, Israel and Egypt, who have opposed the maritime accord.

In a first reaction from the United States on the agreement, a senior U.S. State Department official said the maritime accord was ""unhelpful"" and ""provocative.""",Reuters,libya,,"['Turkey', 'Libya', 'Ankara', 'Russia', 'Jordan', 'Greece', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'İzmit', 'Athens', 'Cyprus', 'United States', 'Israel']",Erdogan says Turkey will increase military support to Libya if necessary * EPeak World News,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-libya-erdogan/erdogan-says-turkey-will-increase-military-support-to-libya-if-necessary-idUSKBN1YQ0BL,None,
