10868969,2020-11-30,"WASHINGTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has begun nominating the members of his Cabinet and White House, working to fulfill his promise to build an administration that reflects the nation's diversity.

Biden nominated senior members of his economic policy team on Monday, led by former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary. He named some members of his foreign policy and national security team last week.

Here are some recent important picks and top contenders for prominent positions, according to Reuters reporting:

The former Fed chair deepened the central bank's focus on workers and inequality and has remained active in policy debates at the Brookings Institution think tank since Republican President Donald Trump replaced her as head of the central bank in 2018.

Tanden, president of the progressive Center for American Progress think tank, helped the administration of former President Barack Obama create the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping healthcare overhaul that was one of his central accomplishments and whose demolition became a goal for Republicans.

Rouse, a labor economist and dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs whose research has focused on the economics of education and tackling wealth inequality, was a member of Obama's council of economic advisers from 2009 to 2011.

A longtime Biden confidant who served as No. 2 at the State Department and as deputy national security adviser in Obama's administration.

Biden's national security adviser when he served as vice president to President Barack Obama, Sullivan also served as deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

A Cuba-born lawyer will be the first Latino and first immigrant to head the department if confirmed as secretary of homeland security. As head of Citizenship and Immigration Services under Obama, Mayorkas led implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for Dreamers, people who were brought to the United States as undocumented children. DACA drew Republican criticism and could lead to Republican opposition against Mayorkas in the Senate.

Deputy national security adviser under Obama, and previously the first woman to serve as CIA deputy director, Haines is Biden's nominee for director of national intelligence. Haines held several posts at Columbia University after leaving the Obama administration in 2017.

Biden's nominee to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is Thomas-Greenfield, who will take on a job that Biden plans to restore to a Cabinet level. She is a Black woman who served as Obama's top diplomat on Africa from 2013 to 2017, leading U.S. policy in Africa south of the Sahara during the West African Ebola outbreak.

Former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Kerry will act as ""climate czar"" in the Biden Administration, the president-elect's campaign announced on Monday. Kerry helped negotiate the Paris climate deal that Biden wants to re-join.

Michele Flournoy - She is the consensus front-runner for the job, which would make her the first woman to lead the Pentagon. Flournoy served as a top Defense Department official in the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations, advised Biden's campaign on defense issues and co-founded a consulting firm with Blinken.

Jeh Johnson - Although best known as the former secretary of homeland security under the Obama administration, Johnson also served as Department of Defense general counsel in the early years of Obama's presidency and as general counsel of the Air Force during the Clinton Administration. A career lawyer, sources say Johnson is also under consideration for Attorney General.

Lloyd Austin - A retired four-star general who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East as the head of U.S. Central Command under the Obama administration, Austin would bring another retired general back to the Pentagon's top civilian post.

Tammy Duckworth - The U.S. senator from Illinois, who was considered as a possible Biden running mate, lost both her legs when her helicopter came under fire while she was an Army officer in Iraq in 2004. Duckworth was an assistant secretary of veterans affairs under Obama and would be the first Thai-American member of the Cabinet.

Sally Yates - A former deputy attorney general, Yates was briefly the acting attorney general early in Trump's term before being fired for insubordination for refusing to defend travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations.

Doug Jones - A former federal prosecutor with a strong civil rights record, he won a U.S. Senate seat in a 2017 special election in deeply conservative Alabama. Jones was defeated this year by Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former college football coach.

Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall - A former adviser to Biden when he was in the U.S. Senate, she served in the Obama administration as deputy secretary of energy, where she led an initiative to address cyber and physical challenges to the power grid. Sherwood-Randall is now a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Arun Majumdar - He was the first director of the U.S. Department of Energy's agency that promotes and funds research and development of advanced energy technologies, and also served as acting undersecretary of energy from March 2011 to June 2012. He also worked at Alphabet Inc's Google as vice president for energy before joining Stanford University's faculty.

Jay Inslee - He focused on climate change during his failed presidential bid in 2019, but was re-elected to a third term as governor of Washington state this year. Inslee has been pushed for consideration in the Cabinet by environmental activists given his efforts to pass a carbon tax and clean-fuels standard.

Heather McTeer Toney - A former regional administrator of the EPA under Obama, the clean-air activist is national field director for Moms Clean Air Force. A favorite of progressives, Toney has advocated and trained diverse officials on leadership and climate in over 15 countries, including Kenya, France, Portugal, Nigeria and Senegal.

Mary Nichols - The former assistant administrator for the EPA during Clinton's administration is chairwoman of California's Air Resources Board, which regulates air pollution in the state.

Collin O'Mara - The CEO of the National Wildlife Federation served as an energy and environment adviser to Biden. Prior to working at the NWF, O'Mara was the youngest person to head up the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, from 2009 to 2014.

Michael Morell - He was the CIA's deputy director and acting director of the agency twice under Obama. Morell is now the chairman of the geopolitical risk practice at Beacon Global Strategies, a Washington consulting firm.

Tom Donilon - The veteran diplomat and former national security adviser under Obama helped steer a White House agenda that increased the U.S. focus on the relationship with Asia. Donilon, a longtime adviser to Biden, worked on Biden's first presidential campaign in 1988.

Vivek Murthy - A physician and former surgeon general, Murphy has gained prominence in recent months as co-chairman of Biden's advisory board on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, which the president-elect has pledged to make his top priority on taking office.

Mandy Cohen - A physician who serves as the secretary of North Carolina's Health and Human Services Department, where she has been a major advocate for expanding Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans. Cohen served as the chief operating officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration.

David Kessler - The former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration has been a co-chair of Biden's advisory board on the coronavirus pandemic. As head of the FDA, Kessler cut the time needed to approve drugs to treat AIDS and moved to try to regulate the tobacco industry.

Biden will name former Obama administration official Jeff Zients to be his White House coronavirus coordinator and former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to return to his previous role, Politico reported. He already has named leading members of his foreign policy and economic teams.

Here are some recent important picks and top contenders for prominent positions, according to Reuters reporting:

Zients, an economic adviser touted for his managerial skills, was tapped to save the bungled launch of the Affordable Care Act's website for former President Barack Obama. Under Biden, he will oversee an unprecedented operation to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a new vaccine, coordinating efforts across multiple federal agencies.

A physician and former surgeon general, Murthy gained prominence in recent months as co-chairman of Biden's advisory board dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, which the president-elect has pledged to make his top priority.

10888101,2020-12-03,"WASHINGTON -- President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s environment and energy team -- facing a narrowly divided Congress and a hostile Republican leadership -- will need creativity and perseverance if Mr. Biden is to follow through on his ambitious promises to address climate change.

In November, Mr. Biden announced that former Secretary of State John Kerry, who made climate change a signature diplomatic issue during the Obama administration, will become an international ""climate envoy."" Mr. Biden also intends to name a high level domestic policy adviser on climate change this month.

But the agency heads, whose names will be announced in the coming days, will be the ones tasked to find a path around Congress with regulations that can cut planet-warming emissions and survive judicial review.

Here are the leading candidates:

Administrator of the Environmental Protection AgencyMary D. Nichols

Mr. Biden's top candidate to lead the agency is Ms. Nichols, California's climate and clean air regulator, according to four people familiar with the matter. She said in an interview that she would accept the job.

Ms. Nichols is the architect of her state's cap-and-trade climate change law, which capped greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, then allowed utilities to buy and sell emissions credits to keep polluting at lower levels. She also helped craft California's tough regulations on climate-warming auto emissions, which served as a model for President Barack Obama's federal climate policies, before they were rolled back by President Trump.

""It's going to be important to quickly reverse and stop a very large number of actions that were done by the Trump administration, and then to restore the agency's scientific basis for its work,"" Ms. Nichols said in a recent interview.

Also in the running:

Collin O'Mara

Currently president of the National Wildlife Federation, Mr. O'Mara is seen by many on the Biden transition team as a strong second choice to lead the E.P.A. if it appears that Ms. Nichols cannot win enough Republican Senate votes to be confirmed for the job.

If confirmed, Mr. O'Mara, 41, would be one of the youngest heads of a cabinet agency in recent history; he has long been described as a ""whiz kid,"" fluent in complex environmental policy issues.

Mr. O'Mara has deep ties to Mr. Biden's home state of Delaware, and to the Biden family. As head of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control from 2009 to 2014. he worked closely with Mr. Biden's son Beau, then the state's attorney general. He has also served as head of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state cap-and-trade program, and served on Mr. Obama's Task Force on Climate Adaptation and Preparedness.

Heather McTeer Toney

The former mayor of Greenville, Miss., and a regional E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, Ms. McTeer Toney currently serves as senior director of Mom's Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group that fought President Trump's efforts to scale back or eliminate air, water and climate change regulations. A top choice of liberal activists, she would be the second Black woman to lead the E.P.A.

Chairman of the Council on Environmental QualityMustafa Santiago Ali

The White House Council on Environmental Quality coordinates and helps shape environmental policy across an administration. If confirmed, Mr. Ali would focus attention on racial disparities in federal environmental policy. With more than 20 years of experience at the E.P.A., Mr. Ali currently serves as vice president of environmental justice, climate and community revitalization for the National Wildlife Federation. He founded the agency's Office of Environmental Justice and under the Obama administration served as a senior adviser to the administrator Gina McCarthy on environmental justice issues.

Also in the running:

Brenda Mallory

Ms. Mallory served as the general counsel to Mr. Obama's Council on Environmental Quality, after more than 15 years at the E.P.A., where she ultimately served as the agency's principal deputy general counsel. She currently is the director of regulatory policy at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit group that has fought many of Mr. Trump's deregulatory efforts in court.

Secretary of the InteriorMichael Connor

Mr. Connor, a former deputy secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration, would be extremely qualified for the post. He worked in the department throughout the Clinton administration, including four years as director of the Secretary's Indian Water Rights Office. He later worked for then-Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, on land, water, energy and Native American issues before returning to Interior during the Obama administration.

He is also a citizen of the Taos Pueblo, a sovereign nation near Taos, N.M., that is one of the country's 574 federally recognized Native American tribes.

A coalition of Democrats, Native Americans and liberal activists have been urging Mr. Biden to nominate a Native American to head the agency, a move that would make history. A Native American has never been in a presidential cabinet, and the Interior Department has for much of the nation's history governed huge swaths of federal land, especially in the West, and often dislodged and abused Native Americans.

Also in the running:

Representative Deb Haaland

The campaign for a Native American Interior secretary was built around one candidate, Ms. Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, who in 2018 became one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. But many of Mr. Biden's advisers fear that she lacks the experience to manage the sprawling complex agency.

Ms. Haaland nonetheless remains a contender, in part because of her political star power.

Among those campaigning for her are the Lakota People's Law Action Center and the actor and environmentalist Mark Ruffalo, who posted a video on Twitter with tribal leaders speaking on her behalf. Representative Raúl Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who chairs the committee that oversees the Interior Department, sent a letter to Mr. Biden signed by at least 50 colleagues urging the nomination of Ms. Haaland, who has served on Mr. Grijalva's Natural Resources Committee since her arrival in Congress last year.

Tom Udall

A New Mexico senator who will retire at the end of the year, Mr. Udall has fought to protect federal property from oil and gas drilling and has promoted the designation of wilderness areas in his home state. If Mr. Udall is picked, he will be keeping up a family tradition: His father, Stewart Udall, served as Interior secretary during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

Secretary of EnergyErnest J. Moniz

A nuclear physicist who served as Mr. Obama's second energy secretary remains in the running to return to his old post. Dr. Moniz, now president and chief executive officer of the Energy Futures Initiative, a research organization, served as an informal adviser to Mr. Biden during the campaign and several people who worked under him at the Energy Department said they would be thrilled to do so again.

But Dr. Moniz has detractors. Liberal groups have protested some of the positions he has taken since leaving government, including a post on the board of Southern Company, an electric and gas utility company. They also objected to his endorsements of nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage as ways to fight climate change because they believe climate policy should focus only on renewable sources like wind and solar.

Though his biggest legacy is helping to secure the Iran nuclear deal, Dr. Moniz played a key behind-the-scenes role in the Paris Agreement on climate change as well, working to make clean energy a core part of the accord. Under Mission Innovation, a parallel agreement to the Paris deal, 19 nations and the United States agreed to double research and development spending on carbon emissions-free energy. President Trump effectively backed out of the pact when he abandoned the Paris Agreement.

Also in the running:

Arun Majumdar

Dr. Majumdar, who currently is heading Mr. Biden's transition team for the Energy Department, could become its secretary. Dr. Majumdar moved to the United States from India to earn a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to become the first director of Energy Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program, where he tried to build strong relationships with Republicans as well as Democrats. Currently Dr. Majumdar leads the Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University.

Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall

One of the earliest female Rhodes scholars, Ms. Sherwood-Randall has a deep background in nuclear weapons, the largest part of the Energy Department's work, as well as challenges to the country's electric grid. A former adviser to Mr. Biden when he was in the Senate, Ms. Sherwood-Randall served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations working on foreign policy and national security issues. From 2014 to 2017 she was the deputy secretary of energy, leading the National Nuclear Security Administration. She also headed up an initiative to address challenges to the power grid.

White House Climate Change CoordinatorAli A. Zaidi

Mr. Zaidi, New York State's deputy secretary of energy and environment, is widely considered the front-runner for the role of domestic climate change coordinator. The new position would require someone who could work with cabinet secretaries and other high-level figures like Mr. Kerry. Mr. Zaidi served as associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under Mr. Obama where he helped design the White House Climate Action Plan, a blueprint for cutting emissions.

Jennifer Granholm

The former governor of Michigan and an adviser to Hillary Clinton on energy has been floated as a potential secretary of energy. But she's also under serious consideration for the domestic climate policy coordinator position, according to two people who said her years of executive experience make her an attractive pick.",The New York Times,energy,,"['United States', 'Washington (state)', 'Delaware', 'New Mexico', 'Nichols, California', 'California', 'Greenville, South Carolina', 'Arizona', 'Taos, New Mexico', 'Taos Pueblo', 'Paris', 'India']",Meet Biden's Energy and Climate Cabinet Contenders,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/climate/biden-climate-change.html,None,
10888102,2020-12-03,"Vanessa Kroll walked into a writers' room in Los Angeles on a Wednesday afternoon last year and smiled at the 14 people sprawled and seated and wedged inside it. One writer looked up and smiled back at her. ""Oh, hi!"" the writer said. ""We were just talking about your brother's dick.""

Vanessa, who was stopping by to say hello while in town, made herself comfortable in a chair. Her younger brother, Nick Kroll, was seated at the far end of the room. Nick waved to his sister. The conversation continued. The room was not in fact talking about Kroll's genitals, but about the genitals of a cartoon character codeveloped by him and named after him and based on a younger version of him who appears on the Netflix show ""Big Mouth,"" which has had three seasons and will have at least three more. It was a thin distinction but an important one, at least H.R.-wise. The discussion veered from individual penis specs to more abstract questioning and back again:

Writer: Does small-dick porn exist?

Writer: Yeah, I've seen a thing where a guy had a really small dick, and it was in a cage.

Nick: What do you mean, in a cage?

Writer: There was a cage around the dick, which was tiny.

Nick: The dick was in prison for the greatest crime of all: being small.

Writer: In a way, it's his journey. Nick has dick-size insecurity. How does he come to terms with whatever his dick is?

And so on, all day. If it was surreal to listen to 14 people talk in detail about the intimate anatomy of someone named Nick who was based on a real person named Nick who was sitting at the table and contributing to the discussion, surely it was weirder to be Nick himself. The more you thought about it, the more layers of peculiarity accrued. Here was a room of well-compensated and well-credentialed and -- judging by the graveyard of Spindrift seltzer cans on the table -- well-hydrated people going on for hours about the penises and vaginas and nipples of televised cartoon preteens with the focus and clarity of, I don't know, Paul Volcker testifying before Congress. Some of them were doing it for the fifth year in a row. All of them would be coming back tomorrow to do it again, and from these conversations -- and from animation, voicing and editing -- would emerge another season of what I'm pretty sure is the greatest work of puberty-themed art ever created.

It's true that this is not a high bar to clear. Of all the traumas afflicting humans -- betrayal, illness, death, war -- puberty is the one that gets shortest shrift in representational form. There are countless books and films and graphic novels about coming of age, but it's rare that they have such a singular focus on the biological mechanisms of the transformation. Maybe artists tend to avoid it because the experience is so grim that they can't bear to revisit it or because much of it is about minors becoming sexual, which is (justifiably) difficult to depict in a palatable or legal form.

And yet puberty is a worthy topic, rich in pathos and discovery and plot twists. Compared with aging, which happens over a long enough period that a person can become resigned to it, puberty is a drone strike of outrageous terror. I still remember the day I started sweating under my arms. (1998, seventh grade, Mr. Trapasso's class.) The idea that I would spend the rest of my life attached to my own armpits -- these moist and endlessly productive sites of pollution -- seemed intolerable. Puberty is body horror in its purest form. It's the menace that can't be fled or destroyed; it's the realization that your own self is the enemy at the gate. I am amazed that anyone gets through it. All of which is to say, it's smart but also possibly inevitable that Kroll and his co-creators picked ""animated series"" as the format for ""Big Mouth,"" their puberty opus about a group of seventh graders in Westchester County.

If puberty is eternal, ideas of what it means to enter young adulthood have changed. The new season of ""Big Mouth,"" which will be released Friday, introduces the character of Natalie, a transgender kid. When Natalie arrives at summer camp, she is met by a chorus of boys -- bunkmates from before her transition -- who pelt her with questions like ""What does your crotch look like?"" and ""Do you pee standing up or lying down?"" The girl campers offer an alternative reaction: ""Yaas, queen! Go off, girlboss. Pussy hat. Slay."" The boys act like crude morons, which is dehumanizing to Natalie. The girls perform a well-intentioned but shallow cheerleading, which is also dehumanizing to Natalie. The joke, however fraught -- however easy to simply not make -- isn't at her expense. Built into the scene is the touchy argument that contemporary life's most sensitive issues deserve to be taken seriously but also joked about; that, in fact, license to do the second is contingent upon the first.

Kroll grew up in Rye, N.Y., with three older siblings. In 1972 his father founded Kroll Inc., a lucrative corporate-intelligence firm that provided ""risk solutions"" to the financial sector (translation: a detective agency, but for businesses). Kroll didn't lack much growing up, either materially or emotionally. He was close with his family. He had friends; his closest was Andrew Goldberg (one of the creators of ""Big Mouth"" and the basis of a character named, unsurprisingly, Andrew). He played sports. Everything was fine until high school, which he entered at barely five feet tall. By junior year he shot up about 10 inches and is now exactly the height of the average American man, but the chapter of time spent undersized among larger males affected Kroll's psyche the way a can of Raid affects an ant.

The problem wasn't only that he was little for a freshman. The problem was also that by the time Kroll hit puberty, most of his peers had progressed through the initial stages of the disease and were in remission. ""When you hit puberty in seventh or eighth grade and you're superhorny all of a sudden, it's not expected that you have an outlet for it,"" Kroll told me. ""But when you're superhorny in high school, there's the possibility that there's an outcome with another person."" The possibility, but not the guarantee, or even the likelihood. ""I spent a lot of high school having crushes on pretty girls who were my friends. Being like, 'I really like you,' and them being like: 'That's very sweet. I'm gonna go give that lacrosse player with multiple concussions a hand job.'"" Kroll's response took the form of repression: The next time he got a crush on someone, he rolled his feelings into a ball and buried it.

Like many men who were rejected by girls in high school, Kroll turned to improv comedy, which he discovered while attending Georgetown. He moved to New York City in 2002 after graduating and got a job at a Gramercy public school, where he taught comedy to middle-school kids in an afternoon program. The job left his mornings and evenings free to do open mics and Upright Citizens Brigade classes and get an agent and start auditioning for voice-over work. In 2011 he released the comedy special on Comedy Central called ""Thank You Very Cool,"" which offers a useful data point for measuring the distance between Kroll's Old Comedy (roughly, everything before ""Big Mouth"") and his New Comedy (everything after).

The Old Comedy was more abrasive and more childish, though not in an unfunny way. He played characters that could have plausibly been drawn from his own life, like a rich imbecile named Aspen Bruckenheimer who considers himself a martyr for having flown coach one time. But he also played a growling Mexican radio D.J. named El Chupacabra and a Pitbull-style pop star with a raspy Cuban accent. Then there's the part in ""Thank You Very Cool"" in which Kroll plays Fabrice Fabrice, a seemingly gay and ""possibly Blatino"" craft-services worker. As Fabrice, he tells the following joke:

""I'm not allowed to say 'retarded' on TV, so what I'm gonna say is 'a frittata person.' There's not a big difference between celebrities and frittatas. They both get driven everywhere, people are always asking who dressed them, and if you make eye contact with them, they [expletive] flip out at you.""

Now, this is not a joke Kroll would perform in 2020. It is almost a textbook example of a bit that would get a person in hot water today, not merely because it mocks three minority groups but also because many people just ... don't find jokes of this kind funny anymore. Like it or not, the political and the aesthetic have become inseparable in comedy these days. It would be understandable -- not necessarily sympathetic, but understandable -- if Kroll reacted with a sense of bitterness at being forced to rethink his comedy. But he hasn't done that. His comedy is still his comedy, and he's not aggrieved at the process of, as he calls it, ""gaining perspective.""

Take, for example, the first time the creators of ""Big Mouth"" really came under fire on Twitter. This was last fall. The outcry was against a scene that some viewers perceived as insensitive. It's too long to summarize here, but basically, a character on the show differentiated pansexuality from bisexuality by implying that bisexuality was not inclusive of nonbinary people. There was a narrow but loud outcry. Perhaps surprising, it was the first time Kroll had gotten significant pushback on ""Big Mouth,"" and I was curious to know a few things about the incident. Starting with: How does a person in his position become aware of such things? Does a Netflix executive leave a menacing ""We need to talk"" voice mail message?

""All of a sudden there was an email saying something like -- not 'The pansexuality crisis,' but an email heading that was between us and Netflix and P.R. that was like, 'Pansexuality controversy,'"" Kroll said. He delved into the email and the tweets that sparked it. There were calls and meetings. The show's co-creators drafted a letter of apology. Their respective teams weighed in on the letter, and the letter was posted to Twitter. This is how P.R. blunders are handled in the 21st century.

As Kroll saw it, the bigger issue wasn't about a vocal minority on Twitter policing comedy but about ego management. ""The question is, Can you take the note?"" he said. Can you unwind your defensive stance? Can you question your own judgment? And that of your best friend? In the pansexual case, yes.

But, I asked him, what if you get a bad note? Not all notes are good notes, even if they go viral on Twitter. What do you do then?

""Well,"" he said, ""you have to look at the note. And take an honest look at yourself. And when we honestly took a look at that scene, we can say we didn't do it as well as we wanted to."" He shrugged. Naturally, the response to the response to the pansexual scene caused its own hand-wringing on Twitter; in this case, about the imposition of a very specific brand of progressive identity politics on comedy. But Kroll didn't see it that way. The freedom to transgress had not been revoked; you just had to think a second longer about what you were transgressing. Also, comic talent has always encompassed an ability to self-adjust at lightning speed. It's called reading the room. (""Big Mouth"" adjusted again to the tenor of conversation this summer, when the actor Jenny Slate, who is white, resigned from her voice role as Missy, a half-Black character.)

Kroll told a story by way of explanation. Last year, he and his extended family went on a trip to the Galápagos. As they traveled from island to island, observing the archipelago's famously rich diversity of flora and fauna, he became especially interested in a species of marine iguana that can survive even if its tail is bitten off by a bird. The marine iguana was a metaphor, he felt: We all need to be the iguana. ""The landscape is changing,"" he said. ""I can either dig my feet in and be like, 'This isn't fair!' or I can be like: 'OK! How do I adapt?'""

Kroll suggested an uphill climb for our next interview. On the trail at Griffith Park, he explained his reasoning: Hiking put you in a situation where you weren't using your phone, it prevented you from getting sleepy (which he often does) and it provided a scenic visual experience. Also, he added, ""You're walking straight forward and you don't have to look at each other, and for guys that can be helpful."" For a winter outing in Los Angeles he wore an olive fleece vest, high-traction shoes and pants that looked antimicrobial. It was 8:15 a.m.

The surrounding vegetation retained the rare smell of rain, which had come down the night before and subdued the path's dust. This was where he'd come up with a lot of the ideas for ""Big Mouth"" -- on strolls with collaborators, where they would work out beats and then carry the beats back to the writers' room and merge them with ideas from the rest of the team, in a system that Kroll and the show's co-creators had refined over time. The writers' room had Rules. No phones or screens allowed. The hours -- 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.-ish -- were fairly consistent. ""There are a lot of writers' rooms that are there until 2 in the morning, and I'm like, 'How is that possible?'"" Kroll said. ""And they're like, 'Well, we watched eight videos of people we hate.' We don't do that at all.""

Keeping up an aerobic pace, we reached the summit quickly and looked out over Los Angeles. It was ravishing. He greeted a dog that reminded him of Freddie Mercury and remarked on the ubiquity of coyotes in the area. ""I'm gonna be a real basic fella and take a panoramic,"" Kroll said. As he panned, a faint smell of smoke arrived on the breeze.

""Have you ever cooked or baked in a wood-fire oven?"" he asked.

Yes, I said, but it activates my rosacea.

Kroll nodded. ""I have that too."" Not rosacea, he clarified, but eczema -- a similarly demonic skin condition. ""From what I can tell, the Jews get eczema and the Irish get rosacea. Maybe if you did a 23andMe, you'd find out that you're Irish.""

Kroll covers skin problems extensively in his stand-up. He has had eczema since he was a kid, and it has gotten worse over time. ""It sucks, it sucks,"" he said. Before embarking on his most recent stand-up tour, Kroll went hiking with his friend and collaborator Jason Mantzoukas, running material past him -- including the skin stuff -- and Mantzoukas kept delivering the same note: ""Dig deeper. You're on the cusp of something interesting, but what was actually going on?""

Kroll tracked the eczema thread back to puberty. It was maddening, he said, to be in your 40s and not know how to handle your skin. If not now, when? The eczema was a wormhole back into adolescence. On ""Big Mouth,"" this sense of helpless mortification is personified in the form of Hormone Monsters, which are literal monsters that are only visible to children in the throes of puberty. Maya Rudolph voices Connie, a confusingly sexy monster with cloven hooves and ripe thighs. Kroll voices Maury, the smuttiest monster, who does stuff like burst from a desk during Sex Ed class and hover behind a student as the kid struggles to suppress an erection. ""Fallopian, what a savory word,"" Maury murmurs into the boy's ear. ""Let's go to the bathroom and climax into that thin toilet paper."" The personification of glandular secretions as chaotic beasts is so crystalline a metaphor that it's almost not a metaphor.

What had become clear in creating ""Big Mouth"" with a diverse roomful of writers, Kroll said, was that every version of personhood came with its own set of problems -- its own Hormone Monster -- and that nobody had it easy. Puberty was the mighty leveler. It spared no girl or boy or gender-nonconforming child. If Kroll could mine his own adolescence for laughs, imagine the possibilities lurking in the histories of comedy writers whose lives looked vastly different from his! For every eczema-riddled short guy, there was an acne-smothered wet-dreaming giant, or an asexual unwieldy-breasted loner, or a wispily-mustached smelly jock. Every adult on earth has a puberty story. The trick was to construct a room where those stories could be told.

When I visited the writers' room on a second afternoon, Kroll was eating a Sweetgreen salad and had time to give a tour of the premises, forking leaves as he walked. Here was his new office, which contained almost nothing except a computer and a view of the parking lot. Here was the kitchen, which featured a fridge crammed with alternative milks. Here was the wall filled with pictures of fans' ""Big Mouth"" tattoos. One person had gotten a pubic hair inked on his foot. Someone else (I hope) had a line drawing of a unicorn having sex with Mr. Clean. And here, again, was the writer's room, a too-small rectangle cluttered with water bottles, colored pencils and limp backpacks. Pinned to the wall were index cards scribbled with things like SOCIETAL BREAKDOWN and YOU ARE ALONE and POO-POO.

The writers filtered back in after lunch and got to work. A few days earlier they had been dispatched on research assignments, each tackling a different topic -- cystic acne, female friendship, revenge porn -- to see whether it might qualify as a theme for Season 5. They had taken turns presenting their findings to the group; the research was now absorbed and being transformed into story lines. The numbers one through 10, for the season's 10 episodes, were written on a whiteboard, and under the numbers were plot points on colored index cards. It looked like Tetris. As they shifted cards around, an assistant kept notes on a running doc projected onto a screen. Conversation veered from Large Questions (Why does trauma affect people differently? How do you know if your father loves you?) to minor tangents (meatball subs; something called Big Nipple Energy).

The environment seemed terrifyingly unstructured. There were no assigned seats or hourly schedules, but people seemed to intuit their lanes. If you took the governing laws of the room and made them visible, it would look like one of those museum laser-security systems in a heist movie. In these ways it was like all writers' rooms, but in other ways it was different. Kroll was constantly interrupted but did not himself interrupt, and there was no sneeze within five meters that did not receive his blessing -- both minor, but detectable inversions of the customary alpha-male dynamic. The word ""nut"" was used as a verb 19 times. And the air seemed pumped with a kind of atomized truth serum, as writers spoke freely about their childhood weight problems, their family histories of abuse, their masturbation habits and the porn they watched. This, Goldberg later explained, was a reason they banned phones from the room. ""We talk about vulnerable things,"" he said, ""and it would feel [expletive] to share something personal and have someone be checking their email."" The pandemic, of course, evaporated this and all the other rules. Ever since what Kroll called ""the Tom Hanks Moment"" -- when the actor revealed that he and his wife had Covid-19 -- the team has convened and written over Zoom.

There's one episode in particular that distills the show's essence into a single story line. It's about the day a girl named Jessi gets her first period. Jessi wakes up and pulls on a pair of white shorts for a class trip to the Statue of Liberty. (White shorts are the Chekhov's gun of menstrual narratives.) On her way up the interior staircase, Jessi starts bleeding. She runs to the bathroom and looks for something to MacGyver a pad out of, but there's no toilet paper or seat covers or other wadding material. Then she's kidnapped by the Statue of Liberty, who has come alive as a cigarette-smoking Frenchwoman. In a heavy accent the statue conveys to Jessi that her period is a kind of synechdochal feminine hex. ""Being a woman is misery,"" the statue sighs, exhaling smoke.

The Liberty Island gift shop sells 9/11 memorial beach towels, one of which Jessi obtains and fashions into an improvised diaper. When I watched the scene, I was flummoxed. It was the only time I'd seen a first period depicted onscreen as simultaneously gruesome, funny and heart-pinching. In other words, realistically. At some point in her life, every woman has fashioned a metaphorical 9/11 towel into a diaper. How could Nick Kroll -- a compassionate human, sure, but a male one -- grasp the psychedelic torment of this milestone? How could he know that menstruating can feel like a near-death experience for a kid? Maybe he could or maybe he couldn't. But he knew people who did, and he got them to talk about it.",The New York Times,energy,,"['Los Angeles', 'Rye, New York', 'Aspen, Colorado', 'Westchester County, New York', 'New York City', 'United States', 'Mexico', 'Cuba', 'Ireland', 'Liberty Island']",How Nick Kroll Became the Picasso of Puberty,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/magazine/big-mouth-nick-kroll.html,None,

Sometimes when I am sitting on the Punta della Dogana, the best lounging place in Venice, I deliberately conjure an illusion. Half?closing my eyes, I see the ravishing city before me, shimmering beyond the Basin of St. Mark's, suddenly restored to imperial grandeur. Then the great banners. floating indolently on their flagstaffs in the piazza across the water, fly not simply for display, but as a boast and a warning to the nations, and the mighty campanile itself seems to look out across the waters as a watchtower of dominion -- ""a quarter and a half?quarter of the Roman Empire,"" as the old Venetians liked to say.

It does not last long. Hardly have I organized the fancy in my mind than a raucous company of sightseers comes ;loudly down the quay, or I hear the dogmatic drone of a guide from the steps of the Salute along the way, and instantly Venice is restored to its contemporary self: Only the tourists pay court to the empty throne of the Doges, only the pleasure boats tie up at the Riva degli Schia voni, and the terrific presence of the city turns out to be no more than a lovely pageant. Venice lost the last remnants of her power 175 years ago, and since then, she has chiefly existed to be stared at, a gallery, a mise en scène, a parody even.

This is a dispiriting moment for me always, and it is then that I enunciate with most conviction my own solution to the perennial problem of Venice: Let her sink.

?

It is not a new plan. For several centuries romantics both foreign and indigenous have seen long ago. This is not a very dignified treatment Thou shalt not kill, the poet said, hut needst not strive/Officiously to keep alive. . . .

?

But is it not enough, you are saying, for the place simply to be beautiful? It is enough, course, but it is something else. The ensemble Venice is not art exactly, especially as it is much lovelier in the whole than in the parts, but even the earthiest rationalist must recognize in its grace, proportion and composition something more important than power or function -- something divine.

This is why, when Venice seemed to be falling apart at last, the civilized world came disinterestedly to its rescue, raising millions of dollars, sending advisers and technicians, and enabling the Italian Government to float a large international loan. Yet even upon these admirable gestures I look, from my seat beside the Dogana lamppost, with a jaundiced eye. Every touching?up, every recoloring, makes Venice a little less real, a little remoter from the truth. Restorers these days are infinitely tactful, I know, but even so they have, for instance, successfully removed most of the magic from the once?haunted cathedral of Torcello, and made Sansovino's loggietta at the base of the campanile look a very much nastier color than I ever imagined it.

Then again, though the Venetians themselves. with their traditional eye to the main chance, do not apparently resent the spectacle of so many earnest foreigners propping up their pilasters and pressure?cleaning their winged Dons, even in this I see a kind of abasement. The Italian Futurist Marinetti, who wanted to destroy all Italy's monuments, was much incensed when Austrian aircraft bombed Venice during the First World War; it was the duty and privilege of the Venetians, he thought, to destroy their own treasures. Much though I admire the work of the world's restorers -- some of my test mends are venetian conservationists -- still I am irrationally antagonized by the assemblage of committees, fund?raising groups and miscellaneous connoisseurs hovering like so many eminent cosmeticians around the still twitching cadaver of Venice.

Venice has long been subject to a particular kind of snobbism, in which esthetic and social pretensions are incestuously combined. Inseparable from the world's concern with the Serenissima today is the figure of the cosmopolitan dilettante, strolling from the Contessa's to the Baronessa's, by way of Harry's Bar, with a few suggestions for the preservation of San Bernardo degli Berensoni, or a tantalizing piece of gossip about UNESCO.

Of course, it is not going to sink. The spectacle of Venice will be with us and our children and our children's children, shored up, cleaned up, numbered, fitted with automatic?translation systems and regularly inspected by the philanthropists of Save Venice Inc.

But just how all that is going to happen, just what the city's own intentions are, just how much has been done already, just what is going on in fact, you must be a better reporter than I am to discover. The spirit of Venice is essentially obscurantist, as it always was, and the affairs of the city today are shot through with ambiguity. Its combination of evasion, shrewdness, guile and introspection has miraculously survived the centuries, and makes it almost impossible to establish a fact, let alone an intention. There are plans and counterplans: there are authorities and delegates: there are laves, presidential decrees, directives; there is the celebrated loan raised for the protection of the city two years ago, and now variously said to be embezzled, used to prop up the lira, held in a special account in the Bank of Italy or lost.

There is the aqueduct that may or may not have been completed; there is the canal that may or may not be continued; there is the new industrial zone on the mainland that is in a state of misty abeyance; there are schemes and counterschemes for blocking the lagoon entrances, restoring the ecology of the lagoon, changing the whole nature of the mainland industries. There are pamphlets by the dozen, Government documents by the ream, coffee?table books by the gross. There is even an unnerving suggestion, currently fashionable, that the climate has changed again since 1966, and that Venice is no longer sinking after all.

Nobody knows. Venice long ago lost her way. Built for autocracy and empire, she flounders messily through the shallows of democratic purpose, confused by dissension, corruption and uncertainty. The long, long decline continues, and with each passing year, each inconclusive debate, her robust reality fades still further, and she exists simply to be.

In this, in a world that is fast forgetting the distinction between truth and fantasy, she is very contemporary. She is the ultimate Williamsburg. Disneyland, perhaps. She is truth turned to makebelieve.

Whether Venice is old or new is immaterial. Almost everything in the city has at one time or another been propped up, renovated or replaced. The pillars of the Doge's Palace are mostly 19thcentury replacements, and the Campanile of St. Mark's was rebuilt altogether when it fell down in 1902. New?old is the true condition of the place: when they cleaned part of the Procuratie Nuove recently, the authorities insisted that part of the removed patina should be painted in again, to preserve the balance of illusion.

But new?old equals dead?alive. When an enlightened British television producer wished show Venice as a living city, not just a museum or a Visconti morgue, he chose to portray the annual gondola regatta, a festivity which, having existed for a thousand years or so, is now organized by the Tourist Department, and features a municipal official of long service dressed up as a Doge. In this the producer is perfectly right: the liveliest aspect of Venice today is a vigorous but ludicrous narcissism, as though the ancient city, finding itself regarded as some sort of circus, has put on the motley in response and become an act even to itself. So a quarter and a half?quarter of the Roman Empire sinks to the level of a fancy?dress charade, and the assembled aficionados flutter with delight -- what truth! what art! Life in Venice, instead of Death!

It is only a danse macabre.

?

The purpose of Venice is being Venice. Because it's there! Yet though in one half of me I really would like to see Venice ending her long drama nobly at the last, to remain with us only as a dream or a universal memory, in other moments I do recognize a deeper point to her survival. I am only the Devil's advocate! Something marvelous happened in Venice tong ago. Some strain in the human genius was plucked once and for all, never to sound again, to leave behind it like long echo this prodigy of the lagoon. Perhaps can inspire us still, even in its degradation? Perhaps even this shade of a shade, this ghost of ghost, can offer us?an example?

But when I reach this point in my meditations, I pull myself together and get up reluctantly from my quayside. And walking back through the Dorsoduro lanes, where the old palaces loom gauntly over my path, and the pigeons murmur in their high niches, and the light dimples once more beneath the footbridges, and the sandoli gleam varnished and flower?decked at their moorings -- walking back slowly toward Rialto, I banish such sententious speculations from my mind, and think, as is only right in Venice, cynical thoughts all the way home. ? as the proper end to the Venetian story the city's extinction beneath the waters that nurtured it -- Ocean's Bride apotheosized at last into the last embrace.

I am considered Philistine when I propose nowadays, but the poets and artists who imagined this marvelous denouement in the past, though they were moved by the tragedy of the theme, still saw grandeur in it. Oh Venice, Venice, cried Byron, when thy marble walls/Are level with the waters, there shall be/A cry of nations over thy sunken halls,/A loud lament upon the sweeping seat -- but what a tremendous moment of mourning he makes it sound! Tintoretto painted a noble picture of the event; Shelley envisaged it in a famous lyric passage; Rose Macaulay was planning a novel about it in her last years; Wagner, who died in Venice, would surely have wished the city to die apocalyptically with him. Those who have conceived the submergence of Venice have generally done so not out of hate but of love, not as an expression of despair, but as a counsel of perfection.

Of course, for sentimentalists like me, the melancholy of the Venetian decline has always had its own beauty What more evocative in the world than some decayed and crumbling back canal of Venice, fragrant with mud and rot -- the old bricks exposed beneath leprous plaster on the palace walls, the blackened saints, lions or chimeras, the tottering iron?propped angels above the church door, the flicker of the water reflections on the dark underside of the bridge, the nostalgia of it all, the suggestion, the resignation? But in savoring the tristesse of Venice, even then we are only paying a tribute to her lost purposes, aware they can never be revived, never rivaled -- and never diminished either, for they exist forever intact and inviolate in minds.

The Venice we possess in this way -- magnificent in the imagination, silently disintegrating in the fact -- was above all an energy. In its great days it was one of the world's prime movers, a formidable imperial power, and all its marvels, all its beauties were elements of its dynamism. It was by no means always an admirable energy. It was often cruel, often intolerant, nearly always opportunist. It was greedy, gaudy, chauvinist and complacent. If the name of Venice was long synonymous with stability and order, it stood too for a fierce autocracy, a terrifying intelligence system and some very disagreeable dungeons. There are few more shameful stories in bistory than that of the Venetian part of the Fourth Crusade, when the Crusaders never reached the Holy Land at all but looted Byzantium instead; but by that cynical coup the Venetians, who provided the crusading fleet, laid the foundations of their wealth, their empire, and their incomparable city.

Yet it was a force always of compelling allure. It fascinated the world. For several centuries Venice was something altogether unique among the powers: a state like no other, a sea?state, a merchant?state, whose banks around Rialto were the financial crux of Europe, whose styles, skills and commodities linked East with West, and whose capital, as it happened, was a city of canals, built on a hundred mudbanks in the middle of a lagoon.

What to do with the flamboyant shell of this entity, when its energy was lost, has been for five centuries the true Venetian problem. The world half awoke to it in 1966, when an exceptional high tide drew attention to the fact that the fabric of Venice was threatened by subsidence and corrosion; but really since the beginning of the 16th century the saga of Venice has been one of re peated, and ever more forlorn, rear?guard actions. The grand fact of Venice was doomed when Vasco da Gaina, discovering an alternative route to the Far East, deprived the Venetians in the long run of their Oriental monopolies, and a series of enervating wars, fought often with great panache, successively reduced the power of the state until, in 1797. Napoleon's forces entered the lagoon, and the Venetian Republic was no more.

The city was then impotent in its lagoon, but still the Venetians and their rulers tried, generation after generation, to restore some honorable purpose to the place. They made causeways to the mainland to reduce its isolation. They started industries on the shore of its lagoon to give it an economic meaning. Once, in 1848, they heroically turned the clock back, declared Venice an independent state again and lived once more for a full year beneath the banner of St. Mark. They built the first of all the motorways, to Padua. They postulated highways across the lagoon itself, or oil pipelines to Germany. They saw Venice as an art center, a cultural entrepòt a free port, a residential retreat, a new home for the United Nations. They created new islands, dredged new canals, brought trains and cars into the city purlieus.

Nothing worked. The superficial problems of Venice can easily be solved: Modern technique can certainly save the place from sinking, and its buildings and treasures from disintegration. The deeper problem remains, and so far every attempt to resolve it has only made matters worse, by polluting the lagoon, by raising the water level, by depopulating the city, by overwhelming it with tourists, by cheapening it with tawdry showmanship.

?

Men are we. wrote Wordsworth at the death of the Venetian Republic, and must grieve when even the shade/Of that which once was great is passed away. Even the shade! For him, as for me, Venice was already dead, and her physical remains did not qualify even as a ghost.

For Venice in its great days was body and soul. It was a highly functional city, designed not just for its times, but for its own specific purposes. Medieval Venice was not only safe in the heart of its lagoon, it was also very handy -- its movement easy, its resources close by, its sewage most satisfactorily removed by the emetic of the tides. Pollution was no problem then, so small was the scale of it all: The lagoon performed its natural functions as it always had, and Venice fitted easily and naturally into the balance of nature. Medieval visitors to the Serenissima marveled at the pomp and beauty of it, of course, but at the efficiency too: It used to be the boast of the Arsenal, the first shipyard of Europe, that it could build, equip and send a galley to sea within 24 hours.

Magnificence came organically to such a place, at such a time. Art, commerce, faith, war and diplomacy were interfused, almost interchangeable. Painters like Titian were figures of state. Musicians like Monteverdi were pillars of the church. The patricians of Venice were merchant?princes. The admirals of Venice were well?known local noblemen. What made sense and money for one class was profitable for all, and all the resources of the state, its gifts, its investments, its crafts, its energies, were absorbed naturally in the public enrichment.

Such a city, such a society, such a philosophy of sovereignty are incompatible with the modem world, and so the idea of Venice is incompatible too. There is no worthy role for Venice now, and all the diligence of the water engineers, all the devotion of the restorers, all the generosity of fundraisers across the world, can do no more than patch up the beautiful old body yet again, like some decrepit but never quite expiring beauty of",The New York Times,energy,,"['Venice', 'Roman Empire', 'Italy', 'Williamsburg, Virginia', 'Torcello', 'United Kingdom', 'Austria', 'Dorsoduro', 'Padua', 'Germany']",LET HER SINK (Published 1975),https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/20/archives/let-her-sink-a-longtime-lover-of-venice-that-flamboyant-shell.html,None,

He is also considering Collin O'Mara, president of the National Wildlife Federation, and Heather McTeer Toney, the former mayor of Greenville, Miss., and a regional E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration.

Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality -- Mr. Biden is considering Mustafa Santiago Ali, a veteran of the E.P.A. who serves as a top official at the National Wildlife Federation overseeing social justice matters. Brenda Mallory, another E.P.A. veteran, is also in the running. She served as the general counsel to the environmental quality council during the Obama administration.

Secretary of the Interior -- Michael Connor, a former deputy secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration and a citizen of Taos Pueblo, one of the country's 574 federally recognized Native American tribes, is viewed as a strong choice for the post. Two others under consideration are Representative Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, and one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress; and Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, who is retiring at the end of the year.

Secretary of Energy -- Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear physicist who served as Mr. Obama's second energy secretary, is on the short list. Arun Majumdar, currently leading Mr. Biden's transition team at the department, is also under consideration, as is Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall who has a deep background in nuclear weapons.

White House Climate Change Coordinator -- Ali A. Zaidi, New York State's deputy secretary of energy and environment, is widely considered a front-runner for the new position. The coordinator would work with high-level officials like Mr. Kerry.

10926724,2020-12-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden has vowed an overhaul of U.S. energy and environment policy to fight climate change, with a goal of bringing the economy to net-zero emissions by 2050.

While the plan has yet to be clearly defined, it includes things like ramping up clean energy technology and usage, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, federal procurement of clean energy technology and reengaging the United States in a global pact to fight warming.

Here are the people who have made Biden's shortlist for central roles in his energy and environment agenda:

* Mary Nichols, chairwoman of California's Air Resources Board

As California's top environmental regulator, she has worked with industry and environmental groups to craft the state's ambitious environmental regulations, from an economy-wide cap and trade program to fuel efficiency requirements for vehicles. The former EPA assistant administrator during the Clinton administration told Reuters that California's auto emissions deal could serve as a ""good template"" for federal standards here.

* Heather McTeer Toney, national field director of Moms Clean Air Task Force

A former regional administrator of the EPA for the southeast during the Obama administration, Toney is a favorite of progressives. She has advocated and trained diverse officials on leadership and climate in over 15 countries, including Kenya, France, Portugal, Nigeria and Senegal. She told Reuters the agency should explore how to better use the Civil Rights Act to protect poor and minority communities from pollution here.

* Collin O'Mara, chief executive officer of the National Wildlife Federation

O'Mara leads the nation's biggest wildlife conservation organization, which advocates for the protection of wild lands and animals, as well as for outdoor sportsman's' issues. Prior to working at NWF, O'Mara was the youngest person to head up the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, from 2009 to 2014. He has been advising Biden's transition team on policy.

* Deb Haaland, U.S. representative, New Mexico

The New Mexico Democrat would be the first Native American to head a cabinet agency. Her nomination to head the department, which oversees the millions of acres of federal and tribal land, has been pushed by a variety of people, from members of Congress to Indigenous leaders to progressive activists. She told Reuters that Interior should be ""promoting and increasing clean-energy leases"" on federal land here and should create more national monuments.

* Tom Udall, U.S. senator, New Mexico

The son of former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, Udall is a long-time Biden friend and former aide and is retiring from the Senate this year. He told Reuters that if nominated to the post, he would set a goal to make federal lands carbon neutral by restoring and protecting forests and shrub lands so they absorb as much carbon as is produced on them here, and that President Donald Trump's moves to open new parts of the Arctic to drilling would be quickly challenged.

* Michael Connor, attorney, Wilmer Hale

Connor, who is also Native American, served as deputy secretary of the Interior Department under former President Barack Obama. His early work at Interior focused on negotiations with Indian tribes, state representatives, and private water users to secure water rights settlements. He currently works at a lawyer on tribal, environmental and energy issues at Wilmer Hale, alongside former Interior Secretary and Biden friend Ken Salazar.

* Ali Zaidi, deputy secretary for Energy and Environment and chairman of Climate Policy and Finance, New York state

Zaidi served as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under Obama, where he led the administration's implementation of the Climate Action Plan. He now leads New York's ambitious efforts on climate policy and finance.

* Jay Inslee, governor, Washington

Inslee ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary with a platform that was focused primarily on climate change. Although he lost, many of his proposed multi-sector climate change policies have been adapted by the Biden campaign.

* Jennifer Granholm, adjunct professor, University of California School of Law

The former Michigan governor (2003-2011) set up a climate action policy for her state in 2007 and worked with the auto industry and the Obama administration on an auto industry bailout that would spur the deployment of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. Last month, she published an op-ed in the Detroit News about the need for a low-carbon COVID-19 economic recovery.

* Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, professor, Georgia Institute of Technology

A former adviser to Biden when he was in the U.S. Senate, she served in the Obama administration as deputy secretary of energy, where she led an initiative to address cyber and physical challenges to the power grid.

* Arun Majumdar, professor, Stanford University

Majumdar was the first director of the U.S. Department of Energy's agency that promotes and funds research and development of advanced energy technologies, and also served as acting undersecretary of energy from March 2011 to June 2012. He also worked at Alphabet Inc's Google as vice president for energy before joining Stanford University's faculty.

* Ernest Moniz, president and CEO of Energy Futures Initiative

Moniz is a nuclear physicist who served as Obama's second energy secretary, and was a technical expert on Obama's team that struck the 2015 deal on Iran's nuclear program. He has been criticized by some environmental groups for his support for a role for natural gas in a U.S. transition toward zero-emissions.

* Marcia Fudge, U.S. representative, Ohio

A member of the House Agriculture Committee, Fudge is an urban-centered politician whose background has been more focused on boosting federal food safety nets and environmental issues rather than advocating for traditional commodity farm production. She has criticized Trump's 2020 Farmers-to-Families Food Box program as lacking transparency and oversight. She would be the first Black woman to serve as agriculture secretary.

* Tom Vilsack, president and CEO of U.S. Dairy Export Council

The former Secretary of Agriculture under Obama (2009-2017) and Iowa governor (1999 - 2007) actively campaigned for President-elect Joe Biden in farm country, acting as his rural and agriculture advisor during the election bid. Vilsack is a strong proponent for the production agriculture wing of the agency.

*Heidi Heitkamp

The former U.S. senator from North Dakota (2013-2019) was a harsh critic of Trump's trade war with China. She is seen to be very tightly allied with North Dakota's oil and coal interests and has blocked legislative efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the past.

10933307,2020-12-09,"Dec 8 (Reuters) - Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has begun nominating members of his Cabinet and White House team, working to fulfill his promise to build an administration that reflects the United States' diversity.

Biden said he would nominate retired General Lloyd Austin to be his defense secretary. Biden already has named leading members of his foreign policy and economic teams.

Biden is expected to nominate Marcia Fudge, a Democratic congresswoman from Ohio, as secretary of housing and urban development and former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary.

Here are some recent important picks as well as top contenders for prominent posts, according to Reuters reporting:

Austin, who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East under President Barack Obama, would be the first Black U.S. secretary of defense if the Senate confirms him.

He retired in 2016 and would need a waiver from Congress to take the post, as he has been out of the military less than the required seven years.

Austin is known as a shrewd strategist with deep knowledge of the armed forces. But his nomination could draw fire from some progressive groups, given his role in retirement on the board of a number of companies, including weapons maker Raytheon Technologies Corp.

Fudge has served in the House of Representatives since 2008. Prior to being elected to Congress, she was mayor of Warrensville Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. If confirmed, Fudge would be the second Black woman to lead HUD, which focuses on federal policy surrounding housing.

Vilsack, who led the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under former President Barack Obama, was Iowa's governor from 1999 until 2007. He was an early supporter of Biden and an adviser on rural issues during his campaign. Vilsack's return to the USDA is likely to be applauded by Midwestern states that produce the bulk of commodity crops like corn, soybeans and wheat, and prefer him to someone from another region of the country.

The current California attorney general was previously a 12-term congressman who played a key role in passing the Affordable Care Act in Congress. As attorney general, he has led a coalition of 20 states defending the program better known as Obamacare, including in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court last month.

10939883,2020-12-10,"NEW DELHI (AP) -- India is facing two public health emergencies simultaneously: critically polluted air and the pandemic. And Surinder Singh, a bus driver in the capital New Delhi, is trapped between them both.

In previous years, the government encouraged more people to use buses that run on cleaner fuels, like the one he drives, as an emergency air quality measure. But this year there are limits on passengers to maintain social distance. The air stings Singh's eyes and he worries about contracting the virus every time a person gets on board.

Still reeling from India's harsh lockdown that dried up his $9 daily income for two months, the 47-year-old father of two says he has no choice but to work. Masked and armed with a bottle of hand sanitizer, he starts his journey near a private hospital that is overwhelmed by virus patients. He travels through roads packed with traffic to the city's largest and most frenetic railway station.

""I drive the bus in constant fear,"" he said.

Millions of others are equally desperate in India's historic recession. The economy contracted by 23.9% in the April-June quarter -- its worst performance in at least 24 years -- and by 7.5% in the next quarter.

The virus, meanwhile continues to spread with over 9.7 million cases, and more than 140,000 deaths. And India's underfunded hospitals, already strained by the virus, are also filling up with patients in respiratory distress from air pollution.

The pandemic has made emergency measures, such as boosting public transit, harder to implement. And long-term targets, including weaning power plants from dirty fossil fuels, are taking a back seat. India plans to increase coal production to reduce imports, and its recovery plan remains heavily reliant on energy sources that produce carbon emissions.

""This pandemic will define the pathway of how we move in the future (to control air pollution),"" said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at the advocacy group Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

India's environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

The dual threat is particularly pronounced in the Indian capital New Delhi, where the annual spike in winter pollution levels has come amid a surge in new COVID-19 cases. The city is among the most polluted in India, where an estimated 1.67 million people die annually from bad air. Dr. Akshay Budhraja, a pulmonologist at a private hospital here, said it was flooded with patients with respiratory distress who thought they had COVID-19. ""Patients are very, very anxious,"" he said.

The Delhi pollution gets worse in the fall and winter when the burning of crop debris in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap smoke close to the city. Over 76,000 farm fires were spotted by satellites in Punjab state -- the most since 2016 -- and Delhi's air quality levels in October were worse than previous years, government data shows.

Although the city of 29 million people and 10 million cars is enveloped in smog, authorities have fewer options than before the pandemic. Last year, authorities had restricted some of the capital's private vehicles and increased public transportation. But this year, standing passengers aren't allowed in Delhi's buses, and metro coaches are only allowing about 50 people, compared to a maximum of 300 in the past. Anumita Roychowdhury, a director at the advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment, estimated that public transit is operating at a third of capacity overall.

The pandemic also has hindered efforts to clean emissions at coal-fired power plants, which account for 65% of India's electricity. The government had asked plants to install technology that would remove sulfur dioxide from their emissions by 2022. But after initial delays from problems in getting loans, the pandemic snapped supply chains and made it impossible to import the required equipment, said Ashok Kumar Khurana, who heads the Association of Power Producers.

India's power ministry has sought a deadline extension from the environment ministry while the government has undertaken measures aimed at boosting coal production. In June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the auction of 40 new coal leases to private miners. Modi described this shift from India's state-controlled coal industry as ""freeing the coal sector from decades of lockdown.""

Last year, the government asked the state-run Coal India to increase the annual production from the current 661 million tons (600 million metric tons) to over a billion tons by 2024. To make the transition to domestic coal easier, it has also waived regulations that mandated a federal environment ministry review if a power plant wanted to change the type of coal being used.

Much of India's coal reserves have a high ash content that burns inefficiently and results in increased emissions and air pollution, said Roychowdhury. India is the third-highest emitter of carbon dioxide, behind China and the United States.

These are efforts to save ""an industry that is already circling the drain,"" said Kanika Chawla, an energy policy expert at the New Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water. Before the pandemic, India's power plants were running below capacity because the growth in power production capacity had outpaced demand.

With demand dipping further, Chawla said that the government had an opportunity to pivot away from fossil fuels and accelerate a ""just"" transition to cleaner fuels. ""We were clearly at a crossroad,"" she said.

10946492,2020-12-11,"WASHINGTON -- The video rollouts of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s pick for Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, and National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, began biographically. But they quickly shifted to focus on an issue that could distinguish Mr. Biden's core economic team from its predecessors: climate change.

Ms. Yellen promised an agenda to promote ""investments that will create jobs and address the tremendous challenge of climate change."" Mr. Biden introduced Mr. Deese by calling him the first N.E.C. director who is a ""true expert on climate policy.""

Both were clear signs that, even as Mr. Biden confronts the immediate task of accelerating the pandemic recovery, he has placed the longer-running climate challenge at the center of his administration's economic priorities.

That climate focus is expected to influence the incoming administration's initial plans to support the economic recovery. Ms. Yellen, Mr. Deese and Neera Tanden, the nominee to head the White House Office of Management and Budget, are preparing to weave efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate clean energy production into the economic stimulus legislation that his team is crafting. It is also expected to play a heavy role in a broader infrastructure initiative that could be one of Mr. Biden's best hopes for a major bipartisan bill in his first year in office.

Climate is also expected to influence his economic approach more broadly, with his team preparing to use the government's vast regulatory powers to advance a climate agenda through financial regulations that could further accelerate the deployment of wind and solar energy, electric cars and other initiatives to reduce emissions -- an approach that Mr. Biden's team insists will create jobs.

Those close to Mr. Biden, who has pledged to take a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change, said he is purposefully putting what scientists believe is the world's largest looming crisis at the heart of the agencies most responsible for promoting the country's economic security.

""Historically we have looked at climate change as an environmental issue,"" said Christy Goldfuss, a former head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality under President Barack Obama, where she worked with Mr. Deese on a so-called green team that helped negotiate the multinational Paris agreement on climate. What Mr. Biden has done, she said, ""is center climate policy in his economic team.""

Ms. Goldfuss and other climate and economic policy experts said they expect Mr. Biden's economic team, led by Ms. Yellen, to continue sounding the alarm about the growing costs of not reducing emissions.

According to a 2018 government assessment, natural disasters and other extreme weather events driven by a warming planet could cost the United States 10.5 percent of its gross domestic product by 2100. This year alone, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there were 16 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters across the country between January and September. That figure did not account for the wildfires that raged across the West, which caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.

""Climate change is going to touch every part of our economy, and climate change policy is going to require us to change the way we power and fuel every part of our economy,"" said Joseph E. Aldy, a Harvard University economist who served as special assistant to Mr. Obama on energy and environment.

Several of Mr. Biden's early economic picks are longstanding voices for emissions reduction as an economic imperative. In 1998, Ms. Yellen, then the head of President Bill Clinton's Council on Economic Advisers, asked Congress to ""consider the costs of inaction,"" warning of ""catastrophic risks"" to the United States amounting to billions of dollars annually because of impending extreme weather events.

""To what extent are we willing to take such chances with our planet?"" she asked lawmakers during one of the more than half-dozen trips she made to Capitol Hill that year testifying in favor of the Kyoto Protocol, the first global agreement to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which the Senate ultimately rejected.

She was less vocal about climate risks in her highest-profile economic policy position, as chair of the Federal Reserve; after her departure from the job in 2018, she called for climate action, including a tax on carbon earlier this year.

Mr. Aldy and others say they expect a Yellen Treasury to focus on a wide range of regulations touching climate issues, including the insurance industry's consideration of climate change and how rising global temperatures could affect the solvency of Medicare and Social Security.

Perhaps most importantly, they expect Treasury and other financial regulatory agencies to lean on investors and the business community to manage climate risks.

Justin Guay, the director of global climate strategy for the Sunrise Project, an environmental group based in Australia that focuses on pushing financial institutions to address climate change, said that would be a key step in helping companies pursue decarbonization targets, and financiers to shift investments away from fossil fuels. But he also called it a minor one.

""That will look night and day compared to the Trump years,"" Mr. Guay said. Still, he noted, most major companies are doing that kind of work, so ""it's a low bar for action.""

He and other progressive climate activists said they hope to see Mr. Biden's economic team use the levers of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation, which created a batch of new regulations and other efforts meant to reduce risk in the financial system, to address climate change. They are pushing the new administration to follow the logic of recognizing the financial risk posed by climate change and enact regulations to prevent banks, asset managers and other financial institutions from financing coal, oil and gas projects.

Some other specific financial regulations that experts said could come early, and which Mr. Biden campaigned on, include requiring public companies to disclose the climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains.

""Climate is the granddaddy of all risk, and the Biden administration wants to shine light on it. The next logical step would be to regulate that,"" Mr. Guay said. No matter what the ultimate makeup of the Senate, he added, ""They have enormous regulatory powers under Dodd-Frank to curtail speculative activities that could lead to the next financial meltdown.""

That trend is already somewhat underway. Several major American banks and international banks have announced policies over the past year prohibiting or limiting investment in new oil and gas projects in the Arctic, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Bank of America recently joined them. The Trump administration, which has been openly hostile to climate science and promoted fossil fuel development, has sought to force banks to continue lending to fossil fuel infrastructure.

The most immediate area in which the climate expertise on Mr. Biden's economic team is likely to come into play is in whatever coronavirus stimulus relief package and subsequent infrastructure package Mr. Biden is able to move through Congress in the early months after inauguration.

Extending and expanding tax credits for wind and solar power is one priority area, but moving to allow the Department of Energy to fund ""green"" banks to support clean-energy infrastructure is likely also on the table. Officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Mr. Biden and Congress to include clean energy components in an infrastructure package in a news briefing earlier this year.

""That could be a big piece in the stimulus negotiations,"" said Tim Profeta, director of Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions and co-author of a set of recommendations called ""Climate 21"" that former Obama administration climate officials released recently.

Another influential set of climate recommendations, under the heading of a ""100 percent clean future,"" was published in 2019 by Ms. Goldfuss and her colleagues at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank in Washington, where she is senior vice president, energy and environment policy. The president of that think tank, and a champion of that report, is Ms. Tanden, the nominee for budget office director.

The Biden administration could also advance recommendations that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued earlier this year. It called for bank regulators to roll out climate stress tests, and for a repeal of a Trump administration rule that bars retirement investment managers from considering environmental consequences in their financial recommendations.

The C.F.T.C. also called for a tax or other means of enacting a price on carbon emissions, which economists have described as the most effective way of driving down planet-warming pollution but is fiercely opposed by both conservatives and some liberal groups. Several economists who favor a carbon tax said they are not optimistic about the Biden administration supporting it.

Asked about the likelihood of Mr. Biden making a strong push on climate change in a stimulus package, Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said he worries about liberal Democrats ""taking him much further to the left than he ever would have chosen by himself.""

Much of the task of crafting a stimulus package with climate elements could fall to Mr. Deese. He served as a senior adviser to Mr. Obama on climate change and helped to coordinate domestic policies like limits on power-plant emissions, before most recently working for the asset management giant BlackRock as its sustainability director.

Mr. Deese helped the Obama administration implement the economic stimulus package that passed in 2009, in the midst of a recession triggered by financial crisis. Environmental groups and others credit that package, which included several enticements for low-carbon energy production, with helping to rapidly cut the cost of wind and solar power production over the course of a decade.

Ms. Goldfuss called that bill ""the most successful climate policy to date in this country"" and said the next stimulus package must go further, to promote electric vehicles, advanced batteries and other emissions-reducing technologies.

""Every one of those requires creating jobs, if you do it right,"" she said.

Jeanna Smialek and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.",The New York Times,energy,,"['United States', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Australia', 'Wyoming']","For Biden's Economic Team, an Early Focus on Climate",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/business/biden-global-warming-economic-team.html,None,
10952747,2020-12-11,"Washington - The video rollouts of President-elect Joe Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, began biographically. But they quickly shifted to focus on an issue that could distinguish Biden's core economic team from its predecessors: climate change.

Yellen promised an agenda to promote ""investments that will create jobs and address the tremendous challenge of climate change."" Biden introduced Deese by calling him the first NEC director who is a ""true expert on climate policy.""

Both were clear signs that, even as Biden confronts the immediate task of accelerating the pandemic recovery, he has placed the longer-running climate challenge at the center of his administration's economic priorities.

That climate focus is expected to influence the incoming administration's initial plans to support the economic recovery. Yellen, Deese and Neera Tanden, nominee to head the White House Office of Management and Budget, are preparing to weave efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate clean energy production into the economic stimulus legislation that his team is crafting. It is also expected to play a heavy role in a broader infrastructure initiative that could be one of Biden's best hopes for a major bipartisan bill in his first year in office.

Climate is also expected to influence his economic approach more broadly, with his team preparing to use the government's vast regulatory powers to advance a climate agenda through financial regulations that could further accelerate the deployment of wind and solar energy, electric cars and other initiatives to reduce emissions -- an approach that Biden's team insists will create jobs.

Those close to Biden, who has pledged to take a ""whole of government"" approach to climate change, said he is purposefully putting what scientists believe is the world's largest looming crisis at the heart of the agencies most responsible for promoting the country's economic security.

""Historically we have looked at climate change as an environmental issue,"" said Christy Goldfuss, a former head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality under President Barack Obama, where she worked with Deese on a so-called green team that helped negotiate the multinational Paris agreement on climate. What Biden has done, she said, ""is center climate policy in his economic team.""

Goldfuss and other climate and economic policy experts said they expect Biden's economic team, led by Yellen, to continue sounding the alarm about the growing costs of not reducing emissions.

According to a 2018 government assessment, natural disasters and other extreme weather events driven by a warming planet could cost the United States 10.5% of its gross domestic product by 2100. This year alone, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there were $16 billion weather and climate disasters across the country between January and September. That figure did not account for the wildfires that raged across the West, which caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.

""Climate change is going to touch every part of our economy, and climate change policy is going to require us to change the way we power and fuel every part of our economy,"" said Joseph Aldy, a Harvard University economist who served as special assistant to Obama on energy and environment.

Several of Biden's early economic picks are long-standing voices for emissions reduction as an economic imperative. In 1998, Yellen, then the head of President Bill Clinton's Council on Economic Advisers, asked Congress to ""consider the costs of inaction,"" warning of ""catastrophic risks"" to the United States amounting to billions of dollars annually because of impending extreme weather events.

""To what extent are we willing to take such chances with our planet?"" she asked lawmakers during one of the more than half-dozen trips she made to Capitol Hill that year testifying in favor of the Kyoto Protocol, the first global agreement to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, which the Senate ultimately rejected.

She was less vocal about climate risks in her highest-profile economic policy position, as chair of the Federal Reserve; after her departure from the job in 2018, she called for climate action, including a tax on carbon earlier this year.

Aldy and others say they expect a Yellen Treasury to focus on a wide range of regulations touching climate issues, including the insurance industry's consideration of climate change and how rising global temperatures could affect the solvency of Medicare and Social Security.

Perhaps most importantly, they expect Treasury and other financial regulatory agencies to lean on investors and the business community to manage climate risks.

Justin Guay, director of global climate strategy for the Sunrise Project, an environmental group based in Australia that focuses on pushing financial institutions to address climate change, said that would be a key step in helping companies pursue decarbonization targets, and financiers to shift investments away from fossil fuels. But he also called it a minor one.

""That will look night and day compared to the Trump years,"" Guay said. Still, he noted, most major companies are doing that kind of work, so ""it's a low bar for action.""

He and other progressive climate activists said they hope to see Biden's economic team use the levers of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation, which created a batch of new regulations and other efforts meant to reduce risk in the financial system, to address climate change. They are pushing the new administration to follow the logic of recognizing the financial risk posed by climate change and enact regulations to prevent banks, asset managers and other financial institutions from financing coal, oil and gas projects.

Some other specific financial regulations that experts said could come early, and which Biden campaigned on, include requiring public companies to disclose the climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains.

""Climate is the granddaddy of all risk, and the Biden administration wants to shine light on it. The next logical step would be to regulate that,"" Guay said. No matter what the ultimate makeup of the Senate, he added, ""They have enormous regulatory powers under Dodd-Frank to curtail speculative activities that could lead to the next financial meltdown.""

That trend is already somewhat under way. Several major American banks and international banks have announced policies over the past year prohibiting or limiting investment in new oil and gas projects in the Arctic, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Bank of America recently joined them. The Trump administration, which has been openly hostile to climate science and promoted fossil fuel development, has sought to force banks to continue lending to fossil fuel infrastructure.

The most immediate area in which the climate expertise on Biden's economic team is likely to come into play is in whatever coronavirus stimulus relief package and subsequent infrastructure package Biden is able to move through Congress in the early months after inauguration.

Extending and expanding tax credits for wind and solar power is one priority area, but moving to allow the Department of Energy to fund ""green"" banks to support clean-energy infrastructure is likely also on the table.

10965109,2020-12-14,"(Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden has promised an overhaul of U.S. energy and environment policy to fight climate change, with a goal of bringing the economy to net-zero emissions by 2050.

Although still to be defined, the plan includes ramping up clean energy technology and usage, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, federal procurement of clean energy technology and re-engaging the United States in a global pact to fight warming.

Here are the people who have made Biden's shortlist for central roles in his energy and environment agenda:

* Michael Regan, Secretary, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, since 2017

Regan has been part of a push to hold big companies like Duke Energy Corp accountable for pollution. Under his leadership of the state agency, Duke Energy agreed to the largest coal ash cleanup in the United States in January.

* Mary Nichols, chairwoman of California's Air Resources Board

As California's top environmental regulator, she has worked with industry and environmental groups to craft the state's ambitious environmental regulations, from an economy-wide cap and trade program to fuel efficiency requirements for vehicles. The former EPA assistant administrator during the Clinton administration told Reuters that California's auto emissions deal could serve as a good template for federal standards here.

* Heather McTeer Toney, national field director of Moms Clean Air Force

A former regional EPA administrator for the U.S. Southeast during the Obama administration, Toney is a favorite of progressives. She has trained diverse officials on leadership and climate in over 15 countries, including France, Kenya, Nigeria, Portugal and Senegal. She told Reuters the agency should explore how to better use the Civil Rights Act to protect poor and minority communities from pollution here.

* Collin O'Mara, chief executive officer of the National Wildlife Federation, the country's biggest wildlife conservation organization

The federation advocates for the protection of wild lands and animals, as well as for outdoor enthusiasts. Previously the youngest person to head up the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, from 2009 to 2014, O'Mara has been advising Biden's transition team on policy.

* Gina McCarthy, President, Natural Resources Defense Counsel

McCarthy headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration, and was key to writing his signature climate change policy requiring steep emissions cuts from the electricity sector, the Clean Power Plan.

* Ali Zaidi, deputy secretary for Energy and Environment and chairman of Climate Policy and Finance, New York state

As deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Barack Obama, Zaidi led the administration's implementation of the Climate Action Plan. He now leads New York's ambitious efforts on climate policy and finance.

* Washington Governor Jay Inslee

Inslee ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary on a platform focused primarily on climate change. The Biden campaign embraced many of his proposed multi-sector climate change policies.

* Jennifer Granholm, adjunct professor, University of California School of Law

The former Michigan governor (2003-2011) set up a climate action policy for her state in 2007 and worked with the auto industry and the Obama administration on an auto industry bailout that would spur the deployment of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. She wrote an opinion piece in the Detroit News about the need for a low-carbon COVID-19 economic recovery.

* Deb Haaland, U.S. representative, New Mexico

The New Mexico Democrat would be the first Native American to head a cabinet agency. Her nomination to head the department, which oversees the millions of acres of federal and tribal land, has been pushed by members of Congress, Indigenous leaders and progressive activists. She told Reuters that Interior should be ""promoting and increasing clean-energy leases"" on federal land here and should create more national monuments.

* Tom Udall, U.S. senator, New Mexico

The son of former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, Udall is a long-time Biden friend and former aide and is retiring from the Senate this year. He told Reuters that if nominated to the post, he would set a goal to make federal lands carbon neutral by restoring and protecting forests and shrub lands so they absorb as much carbon as is produced on them here, and that President Donald Trump's moves to open new parts of the Arctic to drilling would be quickly challenged.

* Michael Connor, attorney, WilmerHale

Also a Native American, Connor served as deputy secretary of the Interior Department under Obama. His early work there focused on negotiations with Indian tribes, state representatives, and private water users to secure water rights settlements. He works as a lawyer on tribal, environmental and energy issues at WilmerHale, alongside former Interior Secretary and Biden friend Ken Salazar.

* Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, professor, Georgia Institute of Technology

A former adviser to Biden when he was in the U.S. Senate, she served in the Obama administration as deputy secretary of energy, where she led an initiative to address cyber and physical challenges to the power grid.

* Arun Majumdar, professor, Stanford University

Majumdar was the first director of the U.S. Department of Energy's agency that promotes and funds research and development of advanced energy technologies and also served as acting undersecretary of energy from March 2011 to June 2012. He worked at Alphabet Inc's Google as vice president for energy before joining Stanford's faculty.

* Ernest Moniz, president and CEO of Energy Futures Initiative

Moniz is a nuclear physicist who served as Obama's second energy secretary, and was a technical expert on Obama's team that struck the 2015 deal on Iran's nuclear program. He has been criticized by some environmental groups for supporting a role for natural gas in a U.S. transition toward zero-emissions.

* Tom Vilsack, president and CEO of U.S. Dairy Export Council

Biden plans to nominate the former Iowa governor, according to two sources familiar with the decision, a choice that would reassure farmers but disappoint climate and nutrition activists. Vilsack held the job under Obama (2009-2017) and actively campaigned for Biden in farm country, acting as his rural and agriculture adviser during the election bid.",Reuters,energy,,"['California', 'United States', 'New Mexico', 'North Carolina', 'Delaware', 'Senegal', 'Portugal', 'Nigeria', 'Kenya', 'France', 'Washington (state)', 'Iowa']","Who will spearhead Biden's climate, energy and agriculture policies?",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-energy-idUSKBN28O2Y3,None,
10965115,2020-12-14,"WASHINGTON -- When Joseph R. Biden, Jr. won the presidential election, his top candidate to lead the nation's most powerful environmental agency appeared clear: Mary D. Nichols, California's clean air regulator and arguably the country's most experienced climate change official, was seen as a lock to run the Environmental Protection Agency.

Now Mr. Biden's team is scrambling to find someone else, according to several people who have spoken with the presidential transition team. The chief reason: This month, a group of more than 70 environmental justice groups wrote to the Biden transition charging that Ms. Nichols has a ""bleak track record in addressing environmental racism.""

Possible last-minute candidates, those people said, include Michael S. Regan, a senior North Carolina environmental official, and Richard L. Revesz, a New York University law professor, neither of whom had been in serious contention for the job until late last week. The Biden team is also considering asking Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency in the Obama administration, to return.

The environmental justice groups cited Ms. Nichols's role in pushing California's cap-and-trade program, which is designed to broadly reduce pollution of planet-warming greenhouse gases -- but disproportionately does so at the expense, the groups said, of communities of color by exposing them to more pollutants like smog and soot. The groups charged that Ms. Nichols had repeatedly disregarded or dismissed the concerns of those communities about the effects of the climate policies she enacted.

The letter appears to have resonated: One of Mr. Biden's key campaign pledges was a promise to address environmental justice, highlighting the need to protect poor and minority communities that are exposed to more pollution than rich communities.

While Mr. Biden had expected that Ms. Nichols would be criticized by Republicans for her history of pushing tough regulations on industries, he was caught off guard by the intense objections to Ms. Nichols from liberals.

The influence of those groups, and Mr. Biden's reactions to their push, appears to be another signal of the increasing tensions between the left and moderate factions of the Democratic Party. Mr. Biden has already been subject to criticism from the left for some of his cabinet picks, even as he explicitly attempts to build a cabinet of racial and gender diversity.

The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

From the perspective of environmental progressives, the push to oust Ms. Nichols in the name of environmental justice is of a piece with ""the battle for the soul of the party,"" said Rich Gold, an energy and environment lobbyist and former senior E.P.A. adviser in the Clinton administration.

Progressive groups and advocates of environmental justice policies say they are heartened that their voices are being heard, and say that elevated consideration of those matters is long overdue.

""Equity and justice were on the ballot,"" said Tina Johnson, director of the National Black Environmental Justice Network, who signed the letter urging Mr. Biden not to appoint Ms. Nichols. ""Being transformative means being willing to walk the walk.""

""I'm happy to hear those concerns, from the environmental justice perspective, have been heard,"" Ms. Johnson said.

But many veteran professionals in the world of environmental policy say that by dropping Ms. Nichols from consideration to head the government agency that will likely be Mr. Biden's most important tool in confronting global warming, the president-elect is significantly weakening his chances of enacting tough, legally sound rules to fight climate change.

""There is no one like Mary,"" Mr. Gold said. "" I don't always agree with her. But let's talk about the qualifications for the job. There's just no one who has the leadership experience on climate at the state level, and at the senior political level at E.P.A.""

Even Ms. Nichols' opponents agree that her experience would have made her a formidable executor of Mr. Biden's climate agenda.

""If I was Joe Biden and I was looking for someone to implement the green agenda, I'd pick Mary Nichols,"" said Steven J. Milloy, who led Mr. Trump's transition team and now runs a website promoting the false information about climate change. ""She's dedicated, she's experienced, she knows the job backward and forward. I don't agree with a single thing she does. She is a 'damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead' type of environmentalist.""

Ms. Nichols, 75, was first appointed to run California's clean air program in 1979 by Gov. Jerry Brown. In the decades since, she has been at the helm of that program as California has been at the vanguard of environmental policy, passing ambitious, first-in-the-nation measures on pollution control and conservation that have often served as models for national and even international environmental law.

During the Clinton administration, she joined the E.P.A. as its top clean air official, then returned to California, where she ran the state's pioneer cap-and-trade climate change program under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. During the Obama administration, it was Ms. Nichols who helped broker a deal with the federal government and the nation's largest automakers, which took California's stringent regulations on planet-warming auto emissions and applied them nationwide. Just as Mr. Obama borrowed clean air and climate change strategies from California, Mr. Biden is widely expected to do the same.

In an interview last week, when she was still seen as a top contender for the E.P.A. job, Ms. Nichols pushed back forcefully at the contention that she has been insensitive to environmental justice issues.

""California is at the forefront of actions anywhere in the nation and the world to direct attention and funding to underfunded communities,"" she said.

Ms. Nichols noted that the primary objection of environmental justice groups has been her embrace of California's cap-and-trade policy, a system under which the state has placed a tightening cap on greenhouse emissions from stationary sources but allows companies to buy and sell permits to pollute.

She noted that the program had been put in place because it was the one preferred by Mr. Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor who passed the state's climate bill in 2006 and recruited her to implement it in 2007.

In pushing the system, Mr. Schwarzenegger was following the recommendations of policy experts: Economists have said for years that the most effective way to reduce climate pollution is to put a price on emissions, thus driving the market away from pollution.

But environmental justice advocates have maintained that the cap-and-trade system privileges corporations over communities by allowing companies to pay to pollute.

""It's a moral objection to the notion of people paying to pollute, and the very concept as a way for companies to trade allowances to comply,"" Ms. Nichols said.

But Ms. Nichols said that, under her guidance, the California cap-and-trade program has allocated 40 percent of the revenues collected from the program to be spent in underprivileged and minority communities.

Even if Mr. Biden chooses another person to head his E.P.A., many of his top climate officials, including John Kerry, the former Secretary of State who will serve as the new White House climate envoy, remain proponents of carbon pricing policies.",The New York Times,energy,,"['California', 'Washington (state)', 'Nichols, California', 'North Carolina']",Claims of 'Bleak' Environmental Justice Record Appear to Fell a Biden Favorite,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/climate/mary-nichols-epa.html,None,
10971403,2020-12-15,"WILMINGTON, Del./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico appears to be President-elect Joe Biden's top choice to head the Interior Department, three informed sources said, a pick that would make her the first Native American to lead a Cabinet agency.

The position would give her authority over a department that employs more than 70,000 people across the United States and oversees more than 20% of the nation's surface, including tribal lands and national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite.

She has told Reuters she would seek to usher in an expansion of renewable energy production on federal land to contribute to the fight against climate change, and undo President Donald Trump's focus on bolstering fossil fuels output.

Two of the sources familiar with the proceedings said Biden's team was close to finalizing the decision on Haaland but weighing concerns about the loss of a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats are hanging on to a slim majority. The third source said the decision was made and that an announcement was imminent.

Biden is also in the process of finalizing other key energy and environment picks, including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator and Secretary of Energy - all of which will be crucial to his sweeping climate change agenda.

Two sources said Biden currently favors Jennifer Granholm to run the Department of Energy. Granholm, 61, was Michigan's first female governor and pushed for a transition to green technologies in the longtime car-manufacturing state.

Progressive activists and tribal leaders waged a pressure campaign over the past few weeks for Biden to select Haaland for Interior, sending letters to the Biden transition team and launching a #DebforInterior campaign on social media.

Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe and one of the first Native American women elected to Congress, has said she believes the fact that she was being considered for the Interior post was good news for Native American areas.

""I'm glad our country's progressed to a place where an idea like this is a consideration,"" she said.

The Trump administration had used the Interior Department as a key tool in its ""energy dominance"" agenda, which prioritized deregulation and fastracking of fossil fuel projects to maximize domestic oil, gas, and coal output.

A key part of his campaign, his climate and environmental justice plan includes ramping up clean energy technology and usage, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, federal procurement of clean energy technology and re-engaging the United States in a global pact to fight warming.

It also aims to tackle racial and economic inequality by addressing air and water pollution in minority, low-income areas located at the fenceline of major industrial facilities by directing investment and strengthening enforcement of polluters, among other measures.

10971409,2020-12-15,"New research details major infrastructure work -- including immense construction projects -- that would need to start right away to achieve Biden's goal of zero emissions by 2050.

If the United States wants to get serious about tackling climate change, the country will need to build a staggering amount of new energy infrastructure in just the next 10 years, laying down steel and concrete at a pace barely being contemplated today.

That's one conclusion from a major study released Tuesday by a team of energy experts at Princeton University, who set out several exhaustively detailed scenarios for how the country could slash its greenhouse gas emissions down to zero by 2050. That goal has been endorsed by President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., as well as numerous states and businesses, to help avoid the worst effects of global warming.

The study's findings are at once optimistic and sobering. Reaching ""net zero"" by 2050 appears technically feasible and even affordable. There are ways to get there that rely solely on renewable energy, as many environmentalists prefer, or that lean on other technologies such as nuclear power or carbon capture. Each approach carries different social and economic trade-offs.

The researchers identified a common set of drastic changes that the United States would need to make over the next decade to stay on pace for zero emissions. That initial groundwork has to start pretty much immediately.

Some examples:

This year, energy companies will install 42 gigawatts of new wind turbines and solar panels, smashing records. But that annual pace would need to nearly double over the next decade, and then keep soaring, transforming the landscapes in states like Florida or Missouri.

The capacity of the nation's electric grid would have to expand roughly 60 percent by 2030 to handle vast amounts of wind and solar power, which would mean thousands of miles of new power lines crisscrossing the country.

Car dealerships would look radically different. Today, electric-vehicle models are just 2 percent of new sales. By 2030, at least 50 percent of new cars sold would need to be battery-powered, with that share rising thereafter.

Most homes today are heated by natural gas or oil. But in the next 10 years, nearly one-quarter would need to be warmed with efficient electric heat pumps, double today's numbers.

Virtually all of the 200 remaining coal-burning power plants would have to shut down by 2030.

Today, there are no cement plants that bury their emissions underground, and there are no facilities sustainably producing hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel. By the mid-2020s, several such plants would need to be operating to prepare for wider deployment.

""The scale of what we have to build in a very short time frame surprised me,"" said Christopher Greig, a senior scientist at Princeton's Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. ""We can do this, we can afford this, but now it's time to roll up our sleeves and figure out how to get it done.""

How to Get to Zero

The Princeton researchers used some of the most comprehensive models to date of America's energy system to figure out which combinations of technologies could zero out emissions at lowest cost. Their work follows an in-depth report in October from the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network that reached similar conclusions.

To start, the United States could make enormous strides over the next decade by rapidly scaling up solutions already in use today, like wind, solar, electric cars and heat pumps. Doing so would require $2.5 trillion in additional investments by governments and industry by 2030.

By midcentury, both studies found, at least 90 percent of the nation's electricity could feasibly come from renewable sources.

Beyond that, however, the task gets harder.

Large parts of the economy still rely on fossil fuels and don't yet have obvious solutions. How do we fuel airplanes and trucks that can't easily shift to batteries? What about industries like steel or cement? How do we keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining?

There are plausible options, the studies found. Wind and solar power could be backed up by batteries, some existing nuclear reactors and a large fleet of natural-gas plants that run only occasionally or have been modified to burn clean hydrogen. Millions of acres of farmland could grow switchgrass, a more sustainable source of biofuels than today's corn-based ethanol. Devices that suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere could help offset emissions.

But most of those technologies are still in early development. That would have to change quickly.

Take heavy industry: If manufacturers hope to capture carbon dioxide spewing from cement factories, the Princeton study concluded, they would need to start constructing early demonstration plants this decade, plus thousands of miles of pipelines to transport the captured gas to underground burial sites beneath states like Texas.

""We need to be building up our options now,"" said Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer at Princeton. ""Both for the problems we know are just around the corner, and as a hedge in case the solutions we think are promising today don't work out.""

Potential Pitfalls

The studies found that, if done right, getting to net zero appears broadly affordable, largely because technologies like wind and solar have become so much cheaper than anyone expected over the past decade. In all the scenarios analyzed, energy costs would remain smaller as a share of the economy than they were during the 2000s.

But there are still significant hurdles. One is the potential for conflicts over land use.

The Princeton study used detailed mapping to see where all those new solar arrays and wind farms might be located. In one central scenario, they could take up land area roughly as large as Wyoming and Colorado combined. Hulking offshore wind farms could dot the Atlantic Coast from Massachusetts to Florida.

If policymakers decided to use only renewable energy, that could require twice as much land.

""It's not a question of whether we have enough land, because we do,"" said Eric Larson, a senior research engineer at Princeton. ""But with that many new projects, you have to ask if they'll run into local opposition.""

Already today, some wind and solar projects attract protests from landowners or farmers worried about nearby disruptions.

The Princeton researchers also analyzed a scenario in which wind and solar power struggled to grow rapidly, and it resulted in the need for lots of advanced nuclear reactors or natural gas plants with carbon capture, technologies still in their infancy.

Another possible obstacle: It's unclear how enthusiastically Americans will embrace plug-in cars or abandon their gas furnaces for electric versions. If electrification is slow to take off, getting to zero could require other potentially arduous options, like huge quantities of biofuels or green hydrogen to supplant oil and gas.

Then there are jobs to consider. Net zero would mean eliminating coal and drastically reducing oil and gas use, displacing hundreds of thousands of fossil-fuel workers. (The Princeton study was partially funded by two oil companies, BP and Exxon Mobil.)

On the flip side, millions of new green jobs would spring up for workers retrofitting homes or building wind farms, though those jobs might not be located in the same regions. Some states, like North Dakota or Louisiana, could see significant disruptions.

""One advantage is that we can see this transition coming, and policymakers can take steps to help affected workers,"" said Emily Grubert, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech who has studied potential job losses. ""But we need to acknowledge that this could hurt some people.""

'The Day After Tomorrow'

While the United States has lowered its emissions in recent years, those efforts would need to accelerate dramatically to stay on pace for zero emissions by 2050.

The report by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network outlined dozens of policies the federal government could adopt. Many are steps Mr. Biden has endorsed, like a nationwide clean-electricity standard or financing for green technologies. Others are more subtle, like streamlining the approval process for transmission lines.

But all levels of society would have to work together, the report said, such as cities rewriting building codes to encourage electric heating, or states reducing car dependency by expanding public transit. Politicians would need to figure out how to gain public acceptance for the sweeping changes unfolding, while protecting vulnerable Americans from harm.

""One question is whether net zero by 2050 can become a consensus national goal, the way building the interstate highway system or going to the moon were,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Columbia University who led the report.

That may prove the biggest hurdle. While Mr. Biden plans to reorient every federal agency toward climate policy, his most ambitious plans could face backlash from a divided Congress.

""These modeling studies are very good, but they assume everything will go perfectly,"" said Susan Tierney, an energy consultant with the Analysis Group who was not involved in either report. ""They can show us how to get to net zero technologically, but not how to solve all those pesky real-world political and social challenges.""

What both studies do illustrate is that there's little room for delay. New cars and factories built today will stick around for decades. If they're not cleaned up soon, it's vastly more challenging to cut emissions later.

""It may seem like 2050 is a long way off,"" said Dr. Jenkins. ""But if you think about the timelines for policies, business decisions and capital investments, it's really more like the day after tomorrow.""",The New York Times,energy,,"['United States', 'Florida', 'Missouri', 'Massachusetts', 'Wyoming', 'North Dakota', 'Colorado', 'Texas', 'Louisiana']","To Cut Emissions to Zero, U.S. Needs to Make Big Changes in Next 10 Years",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/climate/america-next-decade-climate.html,None,
10978221,2020-12-16,"(Reuters) - Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has begun nominating members of his Cabinet and White House team, working to fulfill his promise to build an administration that reflects the United States' diversity.

Biden continued filling out his Cabinet Tuesday, selecting his onetime Democratic rival Pete Buttigieg to be his transportation secretary and former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm to run the Energy Department.

Here are some recent important picks as well as top contenders for prominent posts, according to Reuters reporting:

The longtime Biden confidant served as No. 2 at the State Department and as deputy national security adviser in Obama's administration.

The former Federal Reserve chair deepened the central bank's focus on workers and inequality. She has remained active in policy debates at the Brookings Institution think tank since Republican President Donald Trump replaced her as head of the central bank in 2018.

Austin, who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East under President Barack Obama, would be the first Black U.S. secretary of defense if the Senate confirms him. He retired in 2016 and would need a waiver from Congress to take the post, as he has been out of the military less than the required seven years.

Vilsack, who led the U.S. Department of Agriculture under Obama, was Iowa's governor from 1999 until 2007. He was an early supporter of Biden and an adviser on rural issues during his campaign. Vilsack's return to the USDA is likely to be applauded by Midwestern states that produce the bulk of commodity crops like corn, soybeans and wheat, and prefer him to someone from another region of the country.

The California attorney general was previously a 12-term congressman who played a key role in passing the Affordable Care Act in Congress. As attorney general, he has led a coalition of 20 states defending the program better known as Obamacare, including in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court last month.

Fudge has served in the House of Representatives since 2008. Prior to being elected to Congress, she was mayor of Warrensville Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. If confirmed, Fudge would be the second Black woman to lead HUD, which focuses on federal policy surrounding housing.

Buttigieg is the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and was one of Biden's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. He could be tasked with overseeing much of Biden's plan to boost infrastructure spending, including building electric vehicle charging stations and boosting spending on high-speed rail.

Granholm, 61, served as the first female governor of Michigan, from 2003 to 2011. In 2009, when Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama, she worked with his office on the bailout of auto manufacturers during the Great Recession.

SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS: DENIS McDONOUGH

McDonough was the White House chief of staff during Obama's second term. He spent the early part of his career an aide to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, before advising Obama's 2008 presidential campaign on foreign policy and then serving as deputy national security adviser.

The Cuban-born lawyer will be the first Latino and first immigrant to head the department if confirmed as secretary of homeland security. As head of Citizenship and Immigration Services under Obama, Mayorkas led implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for ""Dreamers"" - people who were brought to the United States as children. DACA drew Republican criticism and could lead to Republican opposition to Mayorkas in the Senate.

Biden's nominee to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is Thomas-Greenfield, who will take on a job that Biden plans to restore to a Cabinet level. She is a Black woman who served as Obama's top diplomat on Africa from 2013 to 2017, leading U.S. policy in Africa south of the Sahara during the West African Ebola outbreak.

The House Ways and Means Committee lawyer played a key role in negotiating stronger labor provisions with the Trump administration in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. Tai, who will lead trade talks with China, previously worked at the office she will now run, heading China trade enforcement from 2011 to 2014. The Yale and Harvard-educated Chinese American speaks Mandarin and taught university English for two years in Guangzhou.

The experienced national security official has served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and as an assistant secretary of state, and was national security advisor during Obama's second term. Rice had been on Biden's short list as a possible vice presidential pick or secretary of state.

CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION DIRECTOR: ROCHELLE WALENSKY

Walensky, currently the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, will take a prominent role in the Biden administration's fight against the coronavirus.

Zients, an economic adviser touted for his managerial skills, was tapped to save the bungled launch of the Affordable Care Act's website for Obama. Under Biden, he will oversee an unprecedented operation to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a new vaccine, coordinating efforts across multiple federal agencies.

A physician and former surgeon general, Murthy gained prominence in recent months as co-chairman of Biden's advisory board dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, which the president-elect has pledged to make his top priority.

Tanden, president of the progressive Center for American Progress think tank, helped create Obamacare, which Republicans want to demolish.

Rouse is a labor economist and dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs whose research has focused on the economics of education and tackling wealth inequality. She was a member of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers from 2009 to 2011.

The Obama administration veteran helped lead efforts to bail out the automotive industry during the 2009 financial crisis and helped negotiate the landmark Paris climate accord.

Biden's national security adviser when he served as vice president to Obama, Sullivan also served as deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Deputy national security adviser under Obama, and previously the first woman to serve as CIA deputy director, Haines is Biden's nominee for director of national intelligence. Haines held several posts at Columbia University after leaving the outgoing Obama administration in 2017.

Former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Kerry will act as ""climate czar"" in the Biden administration. Kerry helped negotiate the Paris climate deal that Biden wants to re-join.

DOMESTIC CLIMATE POLICY COORDINATOR: GINA McCARTHY

McCarthy is the head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group. She ran the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama and managed some of the administration's signature rules for air and water pollution, including the Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from electric plants that the Trump administration has worked to rescind.

A longtime Biden adviser with experience in responding to the Ebola pandemic, Klain was picked for the chief of staff role that sets the president's agenda.

Deb Haaland - The U.S. representative from New Mexico appears to be Biden's top choice to lead the Interior Department. Haaland is a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe and one of the first Native American women elected to Congress.

Sally Yates - A former deputy attorney general, Yates was briefly the acting attorney general early in Trump's term before being fired for insubordination for refusing to defend travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations.

Doug Jones - A former federal prosecutor with a strong civilrights record, he won a U.S. Senate seat in a 2017 specialelection in deeply conservative Alabama. Jones was defeated in the Nov. 3 election by Republican Tommy Tuberville.

Tom Perez - A former labor secretary and one-time head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. His name has been floated though he might face an uphill battle for confirmation in the U.S. Senate if it remains in Republican control.

Heather McTeer Toney - A former regional administrator of the EPA under Obama, the clean-air activist is national field director for Moms Clean Air Force. A favorite of progressives, Toney has advocated and trained officials on leadership and climate in over 15 countries, including Kenya, France, Portugal, Nigeria and Senegal.

Mary Nichols - The former assistant administrator for the EPA during former President Bill Clinton's administration is chairwoman of California's Air Resources Board, which regulates air pollution in the state.

Collin O'Mara - The CEO of the National Wildlife Federation served as an energy and environment adviser to Biden. O'Mara was the youngest person to head up the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, from 2009 to 2014.

Michael Morell - He was the CIA's deputy director and acting director of the agency twice under Obama. Morell is now the chairman of the geopolitical risk practice at Beacon Global Strategies, a Washington consulting firm.

President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to start announcing his energy and environment team within the next few days, and, according to people close to the Biden transition team, two important decisions have already been made.

Those people say Gina McCarthy, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will be his senior adviser on climate change, and Jennifer M. Granholm, a former governor of Michigan, has been picked to lead the Department of Energy.

Mr. Biden on Tuesday named Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend., Ind., to be his secretary of the Department of Transportation, a job that is expected to become climate-centric in the next administration as Mr. Biden focuses on policies to promote electric vehicles and climate-resilient infrastructure.

That person will be central to his campaign pledges to enact an ambitious agenda of reducing planet-warming carbon emissions and reinstating environmental regulations that President Trump rolled back.

So, stay tuned. As soon as we know, you'll know.

Wildfires destroyed 'irreplaceable' trees

They are the only plant species in California honored and protected by national parks that bear their names. They attract crowds from around the world.

But 2020 was not a good year for the coast redwood, the Joshua tree or the giant sequoia. Already under long-term threat from a changing climate, the huge wildfires this year took dramatic aim at the state's three most famous species.

In Big Basin Redwoods State Park, 97 percent of the 4,400 acres of old-growth forest burned. In Mojave National Preserve, a single fire wiped out an estimated 1.3 million Joshua trees (which are really yucca, a perennial shrub). In the Sierra Nevada, the 2020 fires burned one-third of the remaining habitat of giant sequoias, killing hundreds, maybe thousands, of ancient trees in a relative instant.

""They are literally irreplaceable,"" said Kristen Shive, a forest ecologist, ""unless you have 2,000 years to wait.""

The ranges of these species do not overlap; they live in vastly different ecosystems, sometimes separated by hundreds of miles. That is what made 2020 so stunning. Like never before, at least in modern times, has fire done so much destruction to each of these species, and it did it all in one year.

This fall, I accompanied experts into the burn areas -- some of them still smoldering and off-limits to the public -- with the photographer Max Whittaker. What we found was, at turns, heartbreaking, surreal and hopeful.

Heartbreaking because so many trees that had stood stoically in one place were snuffed out so quickly.

Surreal to see a desert turned the color of spent charcoal all the way to the horizon, or a lush green forest of rigid-straight redwoods turned into a jumble of blacks and browns.

Hopeful because there are signs of life, if you look hard enough.

No scientist is predicting the extinction of these species, but concern about each species' long-term viability has grown in recent years because of climate change. The immediate worry is over the preservation of old-growth trees.

The giant sequoias, the world's biggest trees, can live thousands of years. But there are only about 70 sequoia groves sprinkled through the Sierra Nevada, covering about 48,000 acres.

For context, more than four million acres of California burned in 2020. The wrong fires in the wrong places can wreak substantial destruction on the remaining sequoias in a relative instant.

Until the past few years, sequoias were considered practically immune to fire, and fire was a frequent guest in their groves, either from natural causes or from Indigenous land management. But through most of history, scientists said, fires were low-level affairs, occasionally clearing the forest floor and burning themselves out. Sequoias, with their thick bark and crowns that stood above all other conifers, stayed out of the fray.

Not anymore. Not after a century of aggressive fire suppression in California forests -- now widely considered a fatal management error. A severe drought began in 2012, and a bark beetle infestation tagged along, killing huge swaths of forest. Those dead trees, many of them now falling, are kindling for the giant fires that California saw in 2020, and very likely will continue to see.

The stories are different for the Joshua trees and the redwoods. Joshua trees, not built to withstand fires, find themselves in habitats of invasive grasses that are burning more and more with the warming planet. The day that dry lightning started the fire in the Mojave National Preserve, killing more than a million Joshua trees, was the day that nearby Death Valley reached a record 130 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 54 Celsius.

Redwoods were long thought to be protected from big fires by their cool, foggy, coastal environment. This year ended any lingering sense of comfort, especially when so much of the Santa Cruz Mountains, including Big Basin state park, went up in flames. But redwoods have an ability to regenerate that the other species do not. They are harder to kill, though not impossible.

We are left to wonder what it means for the trees, for the state, for the future. You can read the story here.

""A new era of climate accountability is upon us,"" former Vice President Al Gore said in a statement. ""The U.S. is back on task.""

Mr. Gore described Ms. McCarthy as ""uniquely suited for the job"" and said her appointment, along with John Kerry's role as global climate envoy, ""affirms that Joe Biden is serious about America leading by example and driving deep reductions in pollution and climate emissions.""

Ms. McCarthy, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration, was the architect of landmark rules to cut planet-warming pollution. In her new role, she would be in charge of coordinating domestic climate change policies across the federal government.

""Increased innovation -- not the appointment of countless unchecked czars -- will help protect our environment without punishing our economy,"" Mr. Barrasso said.

In her new position, Ms. McCarthy will be empowered to direct agency heads across the federal government to enact climate policies, from emissions rules at the E.P.A. to financial regulations on companies in connection with their bottom-line financial exposure to climate risks.

Ms. Granholm and Mr. Buttigieg are also expected to serve among Ms. McCarthy's top clean-energy lieutenants.

As head of the Energy Department, Ms. Granholm will oversee the United States nuclear weapons complex as well as 17 national laboratories and a wide range of energy research and development initiatives, including a major loan office that backed the launch of Tesla.

Several people close to the transition said advisers had struggled over whether the Energy Department should be led by someone steeped in its core mission, ensuring the safety of the country's nuclear arsenal, or whether Mr. Biden should select someone with a vision for leading a clean-energy transformation.

Ms. Granholm, a longtime champion of renewable energy development, is widely credited during her two terms as Michigan governor with steering her state through a recession and working with the Obama administration on a 2009 bailout of the automobile industry that included clean energy investments and incentives for carmakers to invest in technologies like battery storage.

After her second term ended, in 2011, she became an advocate for renewable energy development. She has given a TED Talk on how investing in alternative energy resources can bolster state economies, something Mr. Biden has focused on in his coronavirus recovery plan.

Mr. Buttigieg, as Transportation Secretary, is expected to play a key role in setting tougher rules on auto emissions, the leading source of climate-warming pollution in the United States, to encourage electric vehicles and to provide funding for mass transit.

""Transportation should really be considered as a green agency,"" said Carol Browner, who served as President Barack Obama's senior climate change adviser.

During his presidential campaign, Mr. Buttigieg pledged to restore Obama-era vehicle emissions standards and called for making the United States carbon neutral by 2050.

Climate change is also expected to play a broader role in planning infrastructure like roads, bridges, dams and levees, as the department takes into account new climate science showing how heat and flooding could damage such structures, and building and planning accordingly.

Mr. Buttigieg has frequently traced his awareness of the climate emergency to his experience managing two immense floods of the St. Joseph River when he served as mayor of South Bend, Ind.

Mr. Biden is also said to be nearing a decision on who to appoint as Secretary of Interior, who would oversee the nation's 500 million acres of public lands, including national parks, oil and gas drilling sites, and endangered-species habitat. The Interior secretary would also be at the head of any effort to strengthen federal protections for vast swaths of land and bodies of water that the Trump administration has opened up to drilling, mining, logging and construction.

The top contender is said to be Representative Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, an appointment that would resonate with symbolism. If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Haaland would be the first Native American appointed to a cabinet secretary position.

The Interior Department has for much of the nation's history governed federal lands and often dislodged and abused Native Americans. Ms. Haaland is a citizen of Laguna Pueblo, one of the country's 574 federally recognized American Indian tribes.

A growing coalition of progressive Democratic groups, Native American tribal leaders and Hollywood celebrities have spent weeks campaigning for Mr. Biden to select Ms. Haaland. Those efforts have had an effect, according to people within the transition.

However, Mr. Biden is also hesitant to remove a Democrat from the House, which would temporarily diminish Democrats' already narrow majority in the chamber until a special election could be held in Ms. Haaland's district.

Other candidates in contention for the Interior post are Michael Connor, a former deputy Interior Secretary in the Obama administration, who is a citizen of the Taos Pueblo tribe, and Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, a longtime friend of Mr. Biden's who has spent his career pushing for wilderness conservation.",The New York Times,energy,,"['Washington (state)', 'United States', 'Wyoming', 'Nichols, California', 'South Bend, Indiana', 'Michigan', 'North Carolina', 'Taos Pueblo', 'New Mexico', 'Laguna Pueblo', 'Hollywood']",Biden's Climate Team Begins to Take Shape,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/climate/biden-cabinet-mccarthy-granholm-buttigieg.html,None,
10978230,2020-12-15,"WASHINGTON -- President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to pick Gina McCarthy, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama and the architect of some of his most far-reaching regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to serve as senior White House adviser on climate change, according to three people close to the Biden transition team.

As White House adviser, Ms. McCarthy will coordinate domestic climate policies across the United States government, playing a central role in helping Mr. Biden make good on his campaign promise of putting the United States on track to reach carbon neutrality before 2050.

Mr. Biden also intends to name Ali Zaidi, the deputy secretary for energy and environment for New York State, who helped write Mr. Biden's climate plan, as Ms. McCarthy's deputy.

Ms. McCarthy, who has served since January as president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, joins the ranks of high-profile former Obama administration officials given top positions in the Biden administration. Advocates for stronger action to fight climate change said her nomination would send a signal that the administration was prepared to bypass Congress and enact measures using executive authority to begin bringing down greenhouse gases.

Her international counterpart is former Secretary of State John Kerry, whom Mr. Biden has tapped to galvanize other nations to take more ambitious action as the United States prepares, after four years of disregarding climate change under President Trump, to restart its own efforts.

""A new era of climate accountability is upon us,"" former Vice President Al Gore said in a statement. ""The U.S. is back on task.""

He called Ms. McCarthy ""uniquely suited for the job"" and said her appointment, along with Mr. Kerry's, ""affirms that Joe Biden is serious about America leading by example and driving deep reductions in pollution and climate emissions.""

As E.P.A. administrator, Ms. McCarthy developed the Clean Power Plan, which set the first-ever national limits on carbon emissions from power plants. She also pushed forward rules to cut mercury emissions from power plants, increase fuel efficiency in automobiles and limit methane leaks from oil and gas wells.

All of those moves were opposed by the coal, gas and oil industries and ultimately repealed or weakened by the Trump administration.

Lawmakers from fossil fuel-dependent states who have clashed with Ms. McCarthy in the past said they were concerned about the prospect of stricter regulations.

""The punishing regulations of the Obama administration hurt Wyoming workers and stifled America's economy.""

The role of a senior adviser on climate change is not entirely new. The Obama administration tapped Carol Browner, a former E.P.A. chief, to be his director of climate policy and, in his second term, brought in John Podesta, founder of the liberal Center for American Progress, to be his climate change adviser.

But Ms. McCarthy's new position -- which is expected to be located within the White House and to have its own staff, as well as authority to work across agencies -- suggests that the role may have significantly more influence than before.

Senator Edward J. Markey called it ""a very strong signal to every federal agency that the president means business and he wants to see real action that every one of the agencies are taking to telescope the time frame that it will take to put meaningful action in place to deal with the climate crisis.""",The New York Times,energy,,"['United States', 'Washington (state)', 'Wyoming', 'Michigan']","Biden to Name Gina McCarthy, Former E.P.A.

McCarthy, who currently serves as the head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, will lead Biden's newly formed Office of Domestic Climate Policy, a source said. McCarthy served as the administrator of the EPA from 2013 to 2017 under President Barack Obama. The source added that Ali Zaidi, currently New York's deputy secretary of energy and environment, will serve as White House deputy climate coordinator. Zaidi served in different climate-focused roles in the Office of Management and Budget and on the White House Domestic Policy Council during the Obama administration.The move is the latest example of Biden's prioritization of the climate crisis. McCarthy joins former Secretary of State John Kerry, who the President-elect named his special presidential envoy for climate, as top Biden officials tasked with addressing the issue. Kerry will be a Cabinet-level official in Biden's administration and will sit on the National Security Council. Kerry is expected to focus on the foreign policy and international aspects of the climate crisis, while McCarthy will focus on domestic issues. It is also another symbolic rebuke of President Donald Trump and his policies. Months after being sworn in, Trump announced the US would leave the Paris Climate Agreement and then revoked a key regulation that underpinned America's pledge in the landmark 2015 international agreement. That regulation -- the Clean Power Plan -- was written by McCarthy when she served as EPA administrator, along with others in the Obama administration. It established the first-ever federal regulations to limit carbon dioxide from power plants. Read MoreTrump has repeatedly denied the scientific reality of the climate crisis and throughout his four years in office his administration has systematically rolled back environmental policies.CNN previously reported that Biden was expected to have a White House climate director working on domestic issues who would be on equal footing with Kerry, according to a source familiar with the matter. Kerry and McCarthy both sat on the Biden-Sanders unity task force focused on climate. McCarthy was originally appointed by Obama in 2009 as assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. Prior to serving in the Obama administration, McCarthy was the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. She has a career that spans decades across state and local levels working on environmental issues. Since January, McCarthy has served as the president and chief executive officer of the NRDC, a non-profit international environmental advocacy group. In that role, McCarthy has led more than 700 attorneys, scientists, policy experts and advocates, according to the organization. Biden has proposed an ambitious plan to spend $2 trillion over four years on clean energy projects and to end carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. But the President-elect's legislative agenda on climate will largely depend on whether Democrats gain control of the US Senate, which will be decided in two runoff elections in Georgia on January 5. Regardless of which party controls the Senate, Biden has pledged on day one to sign a series of climate executive orders, which will not require congressional approval. Biden has also pledged to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on his first day in office. This story has been updated with additional information about McCarthy and Biden's climate plan.",CNN International,energy,,[],Biden to name Gina McCarthy to top domestic climate job,https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/15/politics/gina-mccarthy-joe-biden/index.html,None,
10985062,2020-12-16,"WASHINGTON -- One of President-elect Joseph R. Biden's loftiest campaign pledges was to reimagine the federal government to enforce new climate policies everywhere he can, while reclaiming the global climate leadership role abandoned by President Trump -- objectives with few precedents and many barriers.

His choice this week of Gina McCarthy to lead a new White House office on climate policy firms up his strategy for achieving them, both domestically and on the world stage.

Ms. McCarthy, who, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration, served as the architect of the nation's first climate change regulations, will take up an unusually powerful role, with authority to reach across the government to embed climate policies in virtually every federal agency. According to several people close to the Biden transition team, she will be expected to press cabinet secretaries to enact rules not requiring Congressional approval, be they stricter limits on auto emissions at the E.P.A., climate-friendly farming practices at the Agriculture Department, or requirements that corporations disclose their financial risk from climate change at the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.

In foreign affairs, her counterpart is John Kerry, the former secretary of state who served as a key broker of the 2015 Paris Agreement, under which nearly every country in the world agreed to reduce planet-warming pollution. Mr. Biden last month named Mr. Kerry as his global climate envoy with a seat on the National Security Council, for the first time ever putting climate change at the center of every foreign policy decision that reaches the White House. Mr. Kerry has been asked to travel the world with the tricky task of prodding other nations to follow Washington's lead on climate policy, after four years during which President Trump shredded climate initiatives and mocked climate science.

In short, Mr. Kerry must find a way to persuade foreign leaders that the United States has the credibility to once again to drive global climate action -- something he can do only if Ms. McCarthy is successful in expanding federal policy to reduce America's own emissions.

The task ahead of them will be immense.

Scientists say the warming planet has already passed a threshold at which permanent damage from climate change has begun, and therefore governments must put in place rules to slash emissions as quickly as possible to avoid more severe devastation. Mr. Biden has vowed to set the United States on a path to eliminate its carbon emissions by 2050 -- but experts have called that goal daunting.

Despite that urgency, major climate legislation is unlikely to make it through a deadlocked, partisan Congress. President Trump has all but ensured the Supreme Court will be unfriendly to any legal challenges that Mr. Biden's efforts face.

And their work will continue to face fierce opposition from Republicans and fossil fuel producers.

""Increased innovation, not the appointment of countless unchecked czars, will help protect our environment without punishing our economy,"" said Senator John Barasso, Republican of Wyoming, the nation's largest coal-producing state.

Meantime, the job of special adviser to the president -- which has existed in various forms over the years, from Jimmy Carter's inflation czar to Richard Nixon's energy czar -- is historically extremely sensitive, said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian. ""They get in fights with the existing cabinet secretaries who don't like their toes being stepped on,"" he said.

As a result, the success or failure of Mr. Biden's climate agenda could rest largely on the force of Mr. Kerry and Ms. McCarthy's personalities and clout. Special advisers, he said, ""don't have much power, in traditional Washington terms of having a budget and a department, so their power depends on the access to the president and their ability to influence Congress and the public.""

But people who know Mr. Kerry and Ms. McCarthy said they are well suited to the task.

""Biden ran on climate. This is the first big piece of delivering on it,"" said Carol Browner, who served as the nation's first climate czar, in the Obama administration.

""When I was selected, it was the first senior climate person in the White House,"" she said. ""Now that will be on steroids.""

Though both Bostonians, Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Kerry have distinctively different styles. Ms. McCarthy is known for her South Boston accent, straight shooting, penchant for salty language and for telling people to ""put on their big boy pants."" Mr. Kerry, more formal and mannerly, has used his diplomatic style to build relationships with dozens of world leaders over the decades and can deliver a winding dissertation on energy economics at the drop of a hat.

But the two are also friends and worked closely in the Obama administration. Ms. McCarthy shaped former President Barack Obama's two key domestic climate achievements -- including an E.P.A. regulation limiting planet-warming pollution from power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan -- while Mr. Kerry promoted those policies abroad as part of his diplomatic effort to have other countries adopt similar plans. Both have spent the past four years watching as President Trump dismantled their legacies, withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement and systematically weakening major climate change regulations.

""When you look at the progress we have achieved in climate policy over the last decade-plus, domestically and internationally, there are perhaps no two people who have played a more central role,"" said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University who worked in the Obama White House on climate change.

Mr. Kerry is also close to Mr. Biden, with whom he worked for years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a relationship that could prove crucial in giving Mr. Kerry clout to speak on behalf of the administration.

Ms. McCarthy, meanwhile, spent her four years at E.P.A. writing policies that made some enemies, although today some executives from the polluting industries that Ms. McCarthy sought to regulate speak of her with grudging respect.

""It's hard to imagine anyone who knows better the ins and outs of D.C. and how the executive branch works,"" said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an attorney for the electric utility industry who opposed many of Ms. McCarthy's regulations. ""Most people in Washington like me that even disagree with her on things, hold her in pretty high regard.""

Yet the Biden transition team has so far released few details about how the White House Office of Climate Policy will look like, where its offices will be located or whether it will have a budget. Several people close to the transition have confirmed that Ms. McCarthy will have a deputy in Ali Zaidi, currently New York's deputy secretary of energy and environment and a former Obama White House official who has worked closely on climate policy.

""Now the question is, will this position and its deputy have the power and resources, financial and otherwise, to get the job done? That remains to be seen,"" said Varshini Prakash, executive director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led activist group

John Podesta, the founder of the Center for American Progress and an adviser to former Mr. Obama on climate change, said the bureaucracy and structure around both Mr. Kerry and Ms. McCarthy's roles would be key. When he served as special adviser to President Obama, he said, ""I had to beg, borrow and steal my staff.""

Some White House veterans said that this time around, the climate team may have more allies.

Historically, for example, there has been a clash between White House economic and environmental advisers. But Mr. Biden has named Brian Deese, a former Obama climate adviser, to head his National Economic Council. Mr. Deese worked with Mr. Kerry and Ms. McCarthy in part during the grueling all-night negotiation sessions of the 2015 Paris accord.

""They've been through this war together,"" Ms. Browner said of the three.

Yet the political challenges loom large of moving climate policy amid a Republican-led Senate. ""This will be a key project for Biden's presidency,"" Mr. Podesta said. ""The question is can they get a significant enough amount of cooperation to do the things he wants, or is that a drag on what he can actually accomplish?""",The New York Times,energy,,"['Washington (state)', 'United States', 'Wyoming', 'Paris']","Biden's Twin Climate Chiefs, McCarthy and Kerry, Face a Monumental Task",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/climate/gina-mccarthy-john-kerry-climate-adviser.html,None,

Japan saw its market for green bonds - used to finance clean energy and environment projects - expand to 824 billion yen ($7.95 billion) last year, 24 times its size five years ago, environment ministry data showed. Globally the market has boomed with about $250 billion sold last year - 3.5% of the world's total bond issuance.

Nakazora said green bonds and other ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) assets may eventually make up 20% of Japan's 60-trillion-yen corporate bond market. ESG has become big business for the investment industry with tailwinds coming from U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's campaign pledge to make climate change a policy priority.

""More investors want to put their money in ESG assets, while an increasing number of companies feel they need to issue green bonds,"" said Nakazora, who also oversees ESG investment in Japan.

""Achieving a carbon-neutral society would also require more funds,"" she told Reuters, speaking in an interview on Wednesday.

But she warned that Japan's government must set a clearer timetable on how to achieve its carbon-neutral target for companies to make a smooth transition towards a greener society.

The Bank of Japan can also promote green finance by setting ESG guidelines for its asset management, which would send a message to private banks that they should do so too, she said.

""Central banks across the globe are starting to change with some already managing assets under ESG guidelines,"" said Nakazora, who is currently a member of a finance ministry panel that discusses fiscal and economic policy.

His top lieutenants will include Gina McCarthy, former President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency administrator who Mr. Biden has tapped to head a new White House Office of Climate Policy. Her deputy will be Ali Zaidi, who currently serves as the deputy secretary for energy and environment for New York State.

The group includes progressives like Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, Mr. Biden's choice to lead the Department of the Interior and a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, and establishment figures like Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan who Mr. Biden tapped to be Energy secretary. Michael Regan, North Carolina's top environmental regulator, was named to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and Brenda Mallory, a longtime environmental attorney, will chair the Council on Environmental Quality. And last month Mr. Biden named former Secretary of State John Kerry as an international presidential envoy on climate change.

""Folks, we're in a crisis,"" Mr. Biden said. on Saturday. ""Just like we need to be a unified nation to respond to Covid-19, we need a unified national response to climate change."" Citing the costs and loss of life from wildfires that raged across the West this year, Mr. Biden vowed to restore the regulations that President Trump rolled back, and said, ""We will set new ambitious standards that our workers are ready to meet today.""

When Mr. Biden takes office in January he will inherit a government still struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic and a shattered United States economy that has suffered millions of job losses. He also faces a monumental rebuilding effort after four years in which the Trump administration reversed more than 100 environmental regulations, mocked climate science and championed the production of the fossil fuels chiefly responsible for warming the planet.

On Saturday, Mr. Biden said he intends to make tackling climate change a core part of his coronavirus recovery action, calling for example for the development of more electric vehicle charging stations in any new relief or infrastructure bill. He said he has chosen a team that prioritizes making clean energy jobs and environmental protection the cornerstone of his economic plans.

Climate policy is expected to play a critical role in the Biden administration, the president-elect said. He also highlighted the role of Ms. Granholm, the former Michigan governor who is credited with getting the state's first renewable energy portfolio standard through a divided legislature, and working with the auto industry to develop electric vehicles.

The team includes a number of historic firsts.

Ms. Haaland, Mr. Biden's choice to lead the Interior Department, would be the first Native American cabinet secretary in history, and would helm an agency responsible for managing the United States' relationship with hundreds of recognized tribes.

The Interior department manages the nation's vast natural resources as well as millions of acres of federal lands that include national parks and wildlife refuges. The agency also oversees the listing of endangered and threatened species. Ms. Haaland opposed several Trump administration policies related to federal lands, including his efforts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.

So far, none of Mr. Biden's selections have met with Republican resistance, though some groups that oppose action on climate change have called Ms. Haaland a ""radical"" on energy issues. And North Carolina's Republican senators did not respond when asked if they intend to support Mr. Regan's nomination.

Daniel Keylin, a spokesman for Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said in a statement that the senator ""expects the E.P.A. to balance the promotion of clean energy with the unique needs of America's farmers and small businesses, and not return to the Obama administration's crushing regulation-first approach.""

Next week a group of public health and environmental groups are launching a coalition they have called ""Confirm Climate"" to push lawmakers to support the president-elect's climate change nominees.

Details about how Mr. Biden intends to coordinate the team around climate change remain unclear.

My grandparents, who were taken away from their families as children and sent to boarding school in an effort to destroy their traditions and identities, maintained our culture.""""This moment is profound when we consider the fact that a former secretary of the interior once proclaimed his goal to, quote, civilize or exterminate us. I'm a living testament to the failure of that horrific ideology. I also stand on the shoulders of my ancestors and all the people who have sacrificed so that I can be here.""Jennifer Granholm, Secretary of Energy nominee""My commitment to clean energy was forged in the fire. I was governor of Michigan, as the President-Elect said, during the great recession when it struck and pushed our auto industry, which is the life blood of Michigan, to the brink of utter collapse. Workers were losing their jobs through no fault of their own, banks wouldn't lend, people were losing their houses. Our unemployment rate in Michigan was 15%, in Detroit it was 28%, but then, thankfully, as now, help was on the way. Joe Biden and the Obama administration worked with us to rescue the auto industry and the million jobs that are attached to it.""""The path to building back better starts with building, and manufacturing, and deploying those products here. Stamping them, made in America, and exporting them around the world. We can win those jobs for American workers with the right policy. We can. And I know what those jobs will mean for both the planet and for those workers and families.""Michael Regan, EPA Administrator nominee""Growing up as a child, hunting and fishing with my father and grandfather in eastern North Carolina, I developed a deep love and respect for the outdoors and our natural resources, but I also experienced respiratory issues that required me to use an inhaler on days where pollutants and allergens were especially bad. I've always been curious about the connections between our environment and our health. How the world around us contributes to or detracts from our enjoyment of life.""""We're going to ensure that EPA is once again a strong partner for the states, not a road block. We will be driven by our convictions that every person in our great country has the right to clean air, clean water and a healthier life, no matter how much money they have in their pockets, the color of their skin or the community that they live in. We will move with a sense of urgency on climate change, protecting our drinking water, and enact an environmental justice framework that empowers people in all communities.""Brenda Mallory, chair of White House Council on Environmental Quality nominee""I grew up in the working-class community of Waterbury, Connecticut, a town not so different from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I know the faces of the marginalized and I appreciate the challenges of urban pollution. While the words climate change and environmental injustice were not part of the vernacular back then, the evidence of their impacts was all around. In that setting, there was plenty of opportunity to work to make a difference in people's lives.""""It is essential that we deploy smart and humane policy to help communities pull themselves back from the edge and improve the health, security and prosperity of all people. The Build Back Better plan is poised to breathe new life into the Council on Environmental Quality.

So I figured out early there was just an intrinsic connection between our environment and our health. And that understanding drew me into a very long career of public service, which I will never regret and always cherish.""""And I did it because I was trying to help families and communities just like mine and those who are facing certainly much steeper and more insidious legacies of environmental harm so they could overcome the challenges that were holding them back. Environmental protection is part of my moral fiber. It's what I live for. And I'm proud of the progress that we've made across the United States and I'm proud of the work that I did for many years at local and state governments as well as at EPA to make sure our air and water were cleaner, to make communities safer and more livable and begin to confront the crisis of climate change.

It's a threat to people everywhere and the precious natural resources that we depend on.""Ali Zaidi, Deputy National Climate Adviser appointee""When my parents moved from Pakistan to Pennsylvania, they brought two little kids and a few suitcases of dreams. Dreams their kids are living today ... my brother, a doctor on the front lines of the Covid crisis, and me, moving to the front lines of the fight against climate change.

11026622,2020-12-22,"Joe Biden discusses climate change and the wildfires on the West Coast at the Delaware Museum of Natural History in Wilmington on Sept. 14 during the presidential campaign.

A year ago, amid a crowded Democratic presidential primary, no one would have mistaken Joe Biden as a crusader for climate action.

Youth activists gave his plan to combat climate change a failing grade. Some in his own party wondered whether a self-described moderate could embrace policies bold enough to move the nation past the fossil fuel era.

But in recent days, the president-elect has demonstrated that he is prepared to deliver on his promise to pursue a more ambitious environmental agenda than any of his predecessors -- one that aspires to rapidly shrink the nation's carbon emissions, give voice to the vulnerable communities hit hardest by pollution and create solid jobs in industries helping to create a greener future.

""Folks, we're in a crisis,"" Biden said Saturday in announcing a diverse team of advisers focused on the problem. ""Just like we need a unified national response to covid-19, we need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet this moment with the urgency it demands.""

For Biden, the relentless pressure from activists within his party was not the only motivation to act aggressively. A warming planet has made the issue increasingly hard to ignore, as the litany of climate-related catastrophes has grown with each passing year.

At the current rate, the Earth is on pace to warm more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, a threat that Biden has called ""existential"" and one of his central priorities -- even amid the devastating coronavirus pandemic and a crippled economy.

Although his environmental picks won widespread praise -- including the first Native American interior secretary and two former Cabinet members as White House climate advisers -- it is clear that the Democratic climate policies of the past won't satisfy many allies. They want Biden to take bolder steps to alter the nation's long-term trajectory, instead of ""Obama 2.0.""

Despite President Barack Obama's support for climate action, said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), it involved nowhere near the political determination required to curb climate change.

""After eight years, we were left with nothing. No statute, no regulation, no treaty,"" Whitehouse said. ""A whole different order of magnitude of seriousness and determination is required. The placid and often disinterested approach of those days is no longer an option.""

[How Joe Biden's surprisingly ambitious climate plan came together]

Already, Biden's team is sketching out executive orders aimed at mobilizing the entire federal government to combat climate change and environmental injustice, according to three people familiar with his plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they have not yet been announced.

Biden has vowed to rejoin the Paris climate accord on his first day as president, and convene a climate summit of world leaders within his first 100 days in office. He has insisted that he will create a more ambitious national target for cutting emissions that would ""put the country on a sustainable path to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050.''

At the same time, Biden plans to start a new round of negotiations between the federal government, the U.S. auto industry and California officials to significantly improve the fuel efficiency of cars, pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles -- the largest source of the nation's emissions. He will expedite federal permits for offshore wind projects planned along the Eastern Seaboard, and seek to stop the expansion of drilling on public land.

He has promised an unprecedented focus on environmental inequity, promising to invest 40 percent of clean energy funding in historically disadvantaged communities and ensure wider access to everything from safe drinking water to sustainable jobs in neighborhoods that have long lacked both. He has proposed creating a modern-day ""Civilian Climate Corps"" to help make communities less vulnerable to wildfires and floods.

[Extreme climate change has arrived in America]

""We will be driven by our convictions that every person in our great country has the right to clean air, clean water and a healthier life, no matter how much money they have in their pockets, the color of their skin or the community that they live in,"" Michael S. Regan, Biden's pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency, said on Saturday.

Although he has placed moderates elsewhere in his Cabinet, Biden's environmental picks have been more progressive. His selection of Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) to head the Interior Department sparked an outpouring of support from Indigenous communities and environmental justice advocates. ob administration veteran Brenda Mallory, an environmental lawyer and activist, will be the first Black chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality in its 50-year history. And Regan, who as North Carolina's top environmental official has worked to clean up toxic coal ash near low-income areas, would be the first Black man to head the EPA.

Several Cabinet picks that traditionally don't focus on the environment -- including treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen, Transportation secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese -- have called for deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

And in choosing former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy and former secretary of state John F. Kerry as his top domestic and international climate advisers, respectively, the incoming president has surrounded himself with officials who view the Earth's warming as a crisis.

Although Biden has vowed to move quickly and forcefully, his agenda faces obstacles.

He will be able to make some key changes with the stroke of a pen. But other efforts will undoubtedly face legal challenges that must wind through a federal court system now stacked with Trump appointees. And the most ambitious goals to curb climate change and fund clean-energy technologies will need the approval of a deeply divided Congress.

[Biden wants carbon-free electricity. This is how far we have to go.]

Harvard environmental policy professor John Holdren, who served as Obama's top science adviser, said in an interview that the single most important task Biden could undertake early on is to begin rebuilding the corps of scientists and other experts who focus on climate and energy work across the government. He said many agencies, including the EPA and the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, have been ""hollowed out"" of such expertise.

""There's nothing as important to getting things done in a progressive administration as having a small army of the right people across the departments and agencies, working in common cause,"" Holdren said. ""That was the founding principle, if you will, in the Obama administration, and I think it's going to be a founding principle in the Biden-Harris administration.""

Although President Trump has managed to finalize a startling number of environmental rollbacks -- nearly 140 and counting -- many remain mired in legal challenges. According to a Washington Post analysis, nearly 70 Trump administration actions, on issues including water pollution and weakened energy efficiency standards, face ongoing litigation.

Under Biden, Justice Department lawyers could ask judges to throw out some of those challenges if they make clear that the government no longer plans to contest particular lawsuits, effectively ending some of them.

In an interview before Biden nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that he and other Democratic attorneys general have been compiling a list of administrative actions that Biden could take quickly to reverse Trump policies, as well as a detailed accounting of pending legal challenges, including key dates by which briefs must be filed.

""It's a long list,"" Becerra said with a laugh, adding: ""We're making sure this new administration doesn't get blindsided by some action the Trump administration had undertaken or was launching. We're hoping to help identify land mines.""

[Trump rolled back man astounding number of environmental safeguards. Here's how.]

In some instances, environmental advocacy groups are already trying to chip away at Trump's environmental legacy, even as they press Biden to go further.

Although withdrawing drilling leases is notoriously difficult -- one fight in Montana's Badger-Two Medicine area over a handful of leases dates to the early 1980s -- attorneys from Earthjustice have successfully challenged hundreds of leases in the West on the grounds that Trump officials did not adequately analyze their effects on groundwater and wildlife.

In one case involving the imperiled sage grouse, for example, a federal judge has invalidated at least 381 leases, spanning more than 245,000 acres, that the Bureau of Land Management issued under Trump. The group is now challenging an additional 628 leases on 1,013,587 acres.

""I'm pretty optimistic about our ability to do something about the Trump leasing-Palooza,"" said Drew Caputo, Earthjustice's vice president for public land and wildlife.

Biden intends to restore the diminished boundaries of two Utah national monuments, although legal experts are divided on whether he should issue a new proclamation or whether the administration should issue a legal opinion saying Trump didn't have the right to shrink them.

[Here's what remains of Bears Ears National Monument]

Still, Biden's climate-focused wish list will face plenty of opposition. Some industries, particularly those that rely on fossil fuel production, are likely to oppose any far-reaching new environmental regulations. Republican attorneys general are eager to sue Biden if he oversteps his executive authority -- an issue that led to numerous legal fights with Obama.

And even though control of the Senate remains unresolved, Republicans on Capitol Hill remain wary of any government mandates to reduce U.S. emissions.

""There are ways we can protect our environment without punishing our economy. Free market innovation -- not government taxation or heavy-handed regulations -- is the best way to deal with climate change,"" Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. ""We have passed bipartisan bills that will promote carbon capture technologies, advanced nuclear reactors, and reduce emissions, while allowing our economy to grow.""

Some industries, meanwhile, are more inclined to forge deals with the incoming administration.

Mitch Bainwol, who headed a major auto industry trade group before becoming chief government relations officer for Ford Motor Co., has been trying to get the Trump administration and California to compromise on tailpipe emission standards. But the two sides have remained at odds, and the administration's push to weaken fuel standards while trying to revoke California's right to set its own air pollution rules fractured the auto market.

Biden plans to restore California's waiver under the Clean Air Act within days of taking office, according to three people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America agreed in July 2019 to boost their fleets' average fuel efficiency to nearly 50 miles per gallon by model year 2026. That agreement could be a template for an industry-wide agreement, Bainwol said, while they negotiate longer-term targets.

""We all want regulatory certainty,"" he said. ""Everyone has an interest in figuring this out sooner rather than later.""

Fred Krupp, president of the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund, said in an interview that support for moving the U.S. auto fleet to all-electric ""has more potential for bipartisan cooperation as part of a recovery act than almost anything else.""

Lawmakers from both parties also have an incentive to back the manufacturing of advanced batteries, he added, which could further Biden's goal of curbing transportation emissions. ""This could be a huge boon for jobs in the heart of the country, and we need jobs there.""

Striking a broad agreement with the power sector, which Biden has pledged to make carbon-free by 2035, could be more difficult. Utilities are already phasing out coal-fired plants and expanding their sources of renewable electricity, but not as quickly as the president-elect has outlined. And the EPA's effort under Obama to impose stringent carbon cuts was temporarily stopped by the Supreme Court before the Trump administration reversed it.

Still, EPA could limit traditional pollutants that could pressure companies to shut down fossil fuel-powered operations anyway. John Walke, who directs the Natural Resources Defense Council's Clean Air, Climate and Clean Energy Program, said the agency could tighten restrictions of toxic ash and water discharge from coal plants, and reassess whether the cancer risk associated with such plants' emissions justifies new pollution controls.

Using a 2007 law requiring all new and major renovations of federal buildings to have net-zero carbon pollution by 2030, the new administration can spur a wave of environmentally friendly construction.

Some Trump administration policies, however, will take years to undo. Justin Schwab, who served as EPA's deputy general counsel from 2017 to 2019, said that the case law established during recent years makes clear that delaying or unwinding a regulation can't be rushed.

""The next administration will also likely find there's no quick way to roll back its predecessor's legacy,"" Schwab said.

[Biden's policies on other topics]

Jody Freeman, a Harvard environmental law professor and former Obama climate adviser, agreed that Biden must temper expectations, which don't always match the bureaucratic reality.

""If you get a few major greenhouse gas rules finished before the midterms, that would be a major accomplishment,"" she said. ""But you can't push them too fast. There's this balancing act, going fast enough to get things done, but not so fast that you create legal risk.""

At the same time, Biden will face unrelenting pressure from the left to move quickly, even if the new administration lacks the votes in Congress to lock in durable changes.

Xiye Bastida, 18, who is based in New York City and co-founded the Re-Earth Initiative during the coronavirus pandemic, said that although she and other young activists are encouraged by many of Biden's appointments, the nation needs to move faster.

""We definitely want more ambition on the deadline,"" Bastida said, adding that the world must make deep cuts to keep the planet from warming 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). ""We can not spend the next seven years talking about what we need to do. We need to start doing it.""

It's a pressure the new president is likely to feel from the moment he takes office until the moment he leaves the White House.

""The glass is simultaneously half empty and half full,"" Holdren said. ""There's a lot he can do quite quickly, but what he can do quickly is not nearly enough.""",Washington Post,energy,,"['United States', 'California', 'Wilmington, Delaware', 'Delaware', 'North Carolina', 'Montana', 'Utah', 'New York City']","In confronting climate change, Biden won't have a day to waste",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/22/biden-climate-change/,None,

Backers of President-elect Joe Biden's slate of energy and environment nominees are launching a public affairs campaign to support their Senate confirmations as Republican opposition begins to mount.

The ""Confirm Climate"" coalition, announced Tuesday, counts around 30 environmental and progressive groups as members, and plans digital and social media ads supporting Biden's nominees.

""Over 80 million voters have given the Biden-Harris administration the strongest ever mandate to act on climate and environmental justice, and we need an all-star team of climate policy experts in leadership positions throughout the government to get it done,"" said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters.

The campaign comes amid increasing signs of resistance to Biden's recently unveiled team of cabinet members. The team members include former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm to lead the Department of Energy, North Carolina environmental regulator Michael Regan to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico to be secretary of Interior.

""If the Republicans are in the majority, these nominees are going to have to run the gauntlet,"" Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" about Biden's nominees broadly. ""It's not going to be a garden party.""

Barrasso, who serves as the Senate's No. 3 Republican and is poised to chair the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that would vet Haaland and Granholm, singled out Granholm for remarks she previously made about keeping fossil fuels in the ground.

And earlier, Republican Senator Kevin Cramer, who hails from the oil- and coal-rich state of North Dakota has threatened a ""bit of a brawl,"" and raised concerns about Regan's and Haaland's opposition to fossil-fuel projects.

""We're going to have to stand our ground and fight the fight,"" Cramer said Friday on Fox Business Network's ""Varney & Co.""

It's not clear which party will control the Senate come January. The balance of power hinges on whether Democrats can win both runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5. If they manage that, the Senate will be split 50-50, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the tie-breaking vote.

Climate change is ""the existential threat of our time,"" Biden said, and the people he was nominating to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the departments of Energy, and Interior will be ""ready on day one.""

""We need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet the moment with the urgency it demands, as we would with any national emergency, "" Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Delaware.

With Republicans set to hold at least 50 seats in the Senate, likely dooming the chances for sweeping climate and environmental legislation, Biden will be relying heavily on the officials to advance his clean-energy agenda through federal regulation. He has proposed a sweeping $2 trillion climate plan to promote clean energy, called for an emissions-free electric grid in 15 years and and promised to pare oil drilling on federal lands.

""We need to get to work and we've got to get to work right away,"" Biden said.

He vowed to promote the use of electric vehicles by having the federal government purchase more of them, and to get 500,000 charging stations installed. He also called for 1.5 million energy-efficient homes and public housing units to be built, and 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells to be plugged.

He said the U.S. would rejoin the Paris climate accord and establish a climate-focused civilian conservation corps to put people to work.

The nominees he presented represent veteran government leaders and regulators as well as environmentalists that progressives had demanded. They include former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm to lead the Energy Department, North Carolina environmental regulator Michael Regan to be EPA administrator and Democratic Representative Deb Haaland to head the Interior Department. Biden has also tapped lawyer Brenda Mallory to be chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, Gina McCarthy as national climate adviser and Ali Zaidi as her deputy.

If confirmed, Haaland would be the first Native American in a U.S. cabinet post, Mallory would be the first African American to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality and Regan would be the first Black man to serve as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Lisa Jackson was the agency's first African American administrator, under former President Barack Obama.

Neither McCarthy nor Zaidi will need Senate approval to become climate advisers, and the others are widely expected to be confirmed. However, Republicans have already signaled they will sharply scrutinize the records of Haaland and Regan, including their past opposition to fossil fuel projects. Haaland, for instance, has supported a ban on the fracking process that has propelled U.S. oil and gas production -- a stance that gives oil industry leaders concern but has been heralded by environmentalists.

Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from oil- and coal-rich North Dakota, warned the candidates could see ""a bit of a brawl,"" during a Fox Business Network interview Friday.

The Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico said Thursday it had ""serious concerns"" about Haaland's nomination, adding that she ""has repeatedly demonstrated contempt toward our industry.""

The Interior Department runs the national park system and oversees grazing, recreation, energy development and other activities on about a fifth of U.S. land. The department holds trust title to more than 56 million acres for tribal nations and its Bureau of Indian Affairs works directly with 578 federally recognized Native American tribes.

Haaland, 60, and a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a 7,700-member tribe west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, has drawn widespread praise from environmental groups and tribal leaders. They say she would bring a deep commitment to protect the land to an agency in charge of 500 million acres of it. She was just elected to her second term in the House of Representatives.

Appearing to fight back tears as she accepted Biden's nomination, she noted that one prior Interior secretary had pledged to ""to civilize or exterminate"" American Indians.

""We will ensure that the decisions at Interior will once again be driven by science,"" she said.

McCarthy, 66, who now leads the Natural Resources Defense Council, pioneered the first limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants during her nearly four years leading the EPA during the Obama administration.

""I'm here today because climate change is not only a threat to the planet -- it is a threat to our health and our well-being,"" McCarthy said. ""Defeating this threat is the fight of our lifetimes and our success will require the engagement of every community, every sector in our nation and every country in the world.""

Mallory, 63, previously served as the Council on Environmental Quality's general counsel under former President Barack Obama. Most recently, she has been the director of regulatory policy for the Southern Environmental Law Center, a group that uses litigation to promote clean air, safe water and wildlife conservation.

""It is essential that we deploy smart and humane policy to help communities pull themselves back from the edge and improve the health, security and prosperity of all people,"" Mallory said.

Regan, 44, already worked at the EPA for roughly a decade, though he's currently secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality. He has guided initiatives to combat environmental inequities and climate change, and he's been at the center of disputes over new gas pipelines and pollution cleanup that are playing out nationwide.

Invoking Biden's campaign motto to ""build back better,"" Regan said on Saturday that ""we need an all-hands-on-deck approach from industry and individuals, finding common ground to build back better.""

Granholm, 61, served as energy adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and has been credited with expanding Michigan's clean energy industry during her two terms as governor. She served as Michigan's attorney general from 1999 to 2003, has been an adviser to the Pew Charitable Trusts' clean energy program and is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

Granholm said Saturday that the Energy Department would take steps to assure that a transition to clean energy would result in jobs for Americans.

""We can win those jobs for American workers with the right policy,"" she said.

President-elect Joe Biden has tapped Brenda Mallory to lead the Council on Environmental Quality, a role that would have her coordinating government-wide efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable development.

If confirmed, Mallory would be the first African American to hold the position since its creation more than half a century ago. Mallory's nomination was confirmed by two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named before a formal announcement.

Mallory, 63, is a lawyer who has spent decades pursuing environmental and public health protections in government and the private sector. Mallory previously served as the council's general counsel under former President Barack Obama. Most recently, she has been the director of regulatory policy for the Southern Environmental Law Center, a group that uses litigation to promote clean air, safe water and wildlife conservation.

Her selection comes as Biden assembles a team to carry out his energy and environment policy -- and nears a choice on who will lead the Environmental Protection Agency, which is central to those efforts.

On Tuesday, Biden interviewed North Carolina regulator Michael Regan, a top contender to be EPA administrator, according to a person familiar with the matter.

If confirmed as chair of the CEQ, Mallory would play a pivotal role guiding environmental policy decisions across the federal government. The council oversees implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act, including government reviews of the consequences of agency decisions on everything from land use and endangered species to oil drilling and offshore wind farms.

Under President Donald Trump, the agency has sought to expedite environmental reviews and permitting of pipelines, highways and other projects. Under Biden, the office is expected to play a bigger role addressing environmental inequities, with poor people and minorities more likely to live near refineries, highways and factories and disproportionately affected by the pollution they generate.

The council also may look to bolster the government's calculation of the social cost of carbon, a metric estimating the potential economic damage from climate change historically used to justify environmental policies.

And under Biden, the agency also is likely to rewrite a rule governing agency reviews under the National Environmental Policy ActNEPA, following Trump administration changes limiting the scope of the analysis as well as what projects warrant the scrutiny.

Mallory has argued that NEPA is meant to foster informed government decision making. ""NEPA was not intended to be a process for rubber-stamping government decisions,"" she wrote in a piece for the American College of Environmental Lawyers last year.

Mallory, a graduate of Columbia Law School, has served in other federal government roles, including as acting general counsel and principal deputy general counsel at the Environmental Protection Agency. Her tenure as CEQ's general counsel came as the office worked to beef up federal agencies' consideration of climate impacts in environmental reviews -- an issue likely to land at the top of the council's priority list under Biden.

Environmentalists hailed Mallory's selection.

Ramon Cruz, president of the Sierra Club, said the group is confident Mallory ""will commit to coordinating and scaling clean energy and infrastructure projects that align with an aggressive climate justice agenda.""

Before joining the EPA, Mallory was the chair of the natural resources practice group at the environmental law firm Beveridge and Diamond. While there, she represented Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Simpson Paper Co., and other industry clients in litigation.

""She holds a deep commitment to protecting everyone, including the most vulnerable, from environmental pollution,"" said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel with the environmental law organization Earthjustice. ""By nominating Mallory, President-elect Biden is sending a strong signal that his administration is prepared to take the steps necessary to address the climate and biodiversity crises and take meaningful action to combat environmental injustice.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,['United States'],Biden Taps Brenda Mallory for Environmental Quality Council,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/biden-taps-brenda-mallory-for-council-on-environmental-quality,None,
11062449,2020-12-17,"I believe Covid-19 has highlighted the urgency to expand sustainable energy solutions worldwide -- the World Health Organization even stated that ""to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets by 2030, countries must safeguard the gains already attained and accelerate efforts to achieve affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.""

In my experience, the consumer has placed even greater importance on products and services that not only last, but also lessen our environmental footprint every step of the way. Even businesses are aggressively seeking out solutions that position them as being environmentally minded while streamlining processes and cutting costs.

So, how do you make your business more environmentally conscious? Steer your innovation teams toward designing truly sustainable technology.

How can you pursue a vision of sustainability and sustainable technology?

Especially in times of fundamental change, it is important to take responsibility for people, the environment and society. That is why businesses should commit to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which extend into 2030 and are intended to promote sustainable development worldwide. Support these goals with your products and services by offering solutions to social challenges and finding answers to environmental and social questions. For example, at Bosch, we are taking responsibility by making over 400 locations carbon neutral in 2020.

How can businesses lean into sustainable technology during the pandemic?

Cities in the 21st century are facing major challenges: The world population is growing, and resources are dwindling. The climate is changing. We need solutions, and this acknowledgment seems to have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. My company believes that electromobility can make a significant contribution to sustainable urban development and an urban environment worth living in. EBikes offer a great opportunities by helping to conserve resources and reduce emissions. Companies can follow in our footsteps by adapting the sustainability strategy at Bosch, which defines future corporate sustainability topics, goals and strategic topics. This vision is derived from six megatrends (health, globalization, urbanization, energy, water and climate management), and it addresses and connects some of the most pressing environmental challenges to corporate activities. Other businesses can replicate this strategy through innovation and forward-thinking when it comes to the environment.

How has the pandemic shifted behaviors and buying habits to focus on sustainable technology?

Consumer behaviors in the pandemic have shifted, and consumers may demand better local living environments, take a closer look at their communities, and examine how well they serve their needs and the changes needed for the new world ahead. As Accenture research (via NACS) highlights, many of the changes in consumer behavior are likely to continue long after the pandemic. The survey suggests that consumers are more seriously considering the health and environmental impacts of their shopping choices:

* 60% of respondents are spending more time on self-care and mental well-being, and 57% reported that they have started exercising more at home.

* 50% said they are more health-conscious when shopping and are likely to continue these shopping patterns.

* 45% said they are making more sustainable choices when shopping, and they reported that they will likely continue to do so.

There may be a more sustainable and healthier era of consumption in the coming years, which means consumers will think more about balancing what they buy with global issues of sustainability. In my experience, this is especially true of transportation and recreation trends.

How can you use the topic of sustainable technology to drive change in your industry?

* Encourage new adopters by highlighting the benefits your company, brand or service has for the environment. Release publications such as sustainability reports to share all facts, figures and nonfinancial information concerning your company's sustainability activities or a magazine that presents highlights from the reporting year.

* Be committed to uncompromising quality and ensure compliance with safety standards. For example, our complete system features the UL 2849 safety standard from the Underwriters Laboratory for peace of mind and thus meets its testing requirements. Industry standards are generally meant to measure and validate performance, environmental health and sustainability and thus help create a safer, more sustainable world. Use your website, product catalogs and dealer trainings to recommend that your customers always look for your industry's marks of compliance. Should they purchase a charger for their phones or a microwave without any third-party certification, for example?

* Share tips and tricks with consumers to showcase your company's commitment to sustainability. Make your story and commitment public: Share it on YouTube and reveal tangible actions your company is taking to achieve its sustainability targets. Your transparency will add credibility to your actions and hold you accountable.

* Network with other sustainability-minded business leaders. Participate in panel discussions with other experts to discuss scientific, technological and sociological complexities relating to energy, the environment and sustainability.

Conclusion

Coming from an industry that saw an ""electric bike spike,"" I have seen firsthand the boom that sustainable technology can support. By leaning into the same, both businesses and the environment have a lot to gain.

The UK is leading the climate pack with news of its new target of 68% emission reductions from 1990 levels by 2030, and Boris Johnson recently launched a ten-point plan for a net zero economy. Today's launch of the UK's Energy White Paper was supposed to build on those plans, but it has left more questions than answers.

The Energy White Paper sets out the UK's intention to create 220,000 new jobs, all while cutting emissions from industry, transport, and buildings by 230 million metric tonnes. Where the plan falls down is in the detail. While the plan may have £12 billion set aside for its implementation, this pales into insignificance in relation to investment plans that will completely undercut the net carbon shift - amongst these are reported plans for £90 billion in investment in roads alone.

Business and energy secretary Alok Sharma said in a statement, that ""Today's plan establishes a decisive and permanent shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels"". The plan touches on the importance of offshore wind, low carbon hydrogen, 'jet zero' and green ships, greener buildings, the natural environment, as well as green finance and innovation. So far, so good.

It also includes the discussion of new nuclear. Some commentators see potential in new approaches in small and modular reactors, but the latest news suggests the government is more interested in another white elephant at a cost of £20 billion for Sizewell C. When has a nuclear power plant ever come in on time and on budget? Of course, there is also the suggestion of looking to develop a nuclear fusion plant, to come online by 2040. Leaving aside the fact that the UK is now out of the most advanced fusion project ITER due to Brexit, planning for something that will come on line ten years after the deadline required for emissions cuts seems short-sighted at best.

The UK government plans four industrial clusters for carbon capture storage and use (CCSU), a suite of technologies gaining traction in the market. No one doubts the importance of carbon capture, storage and use in reaching net zero, but the technology has been around the corner for decades, and it seems unlikely that the £1 billion the UK government is committing to the technology will get it over the line. Currently the costs range between $600 - $1000 per ton of CO2 captured, with the goal of reaching $100 within the decade.

Electric vehicles have got a boost, with £1.3 billion to be invested into charge points as well as up to £1bn to support the electrification of cars, including the mass-production of batteries for electric vehicles. To put this in context though, the UK government has budgeted for a £27.4 billion investment plan into road building with its Road Investment Strategy 2. Not necessarily the lowest carbon or most sustainable approach - in fact, in March the Transport Action Network (TAN) took the government to court on the grounds that its plan (reported to involved around £90 billion in road investment over the next couple of decades) would make it impossible for the UK to meets its commitments under the Paris Agreement. The TAN wanted to see that spend diverted into public transport, rail freight, cycling and walking.

It took until October 2020 for the government to refuse to review its policy. Now TAN has launched another legal challenge, this time to counter the government position that no road building can take carbon impact into consideration. The National Policy Statement for National Networks states that because the Government has ""a credible plan for meeting carbon budgets...any increase in carbon emissions is not a reason to refuse [road] development"".

Market interest in the potential in green or low carbon hydrogen (whether for transportation or long-term seasonal electricity storage) continues to grow. The government announced a 5GW target for hydrogen production by 2030, including a new £240m net zero Hydrogen Fund for low carbon hydrogen production. But is that enough given how short our time frame?

There is a transition taking place. We've seen it beginning in the energy sector with the oil majors struggling for reinvention and renewable energy companies becoming financial powerhouses. There is huge opportunity to find new growth, develop new technologies, begin building robust and resilient supply chains that could help the UK build leadership in these new areas as it mouths leadership on the climate front.

The Climate Change Committee December report said that emissions must fall by almost 80% in the UK by 2035- a big step-up in ambition given that just 18 months ago this was the UK's 2050 goal. While this will require major investment the cost has fallen significantly over the last few years, down to around 0.5% of GDP over the next thirty years.

Adair Turner - chair of the Energy Transitions Commission and former chair of the CCC - wrote in the FT that the estimated costs for reducing emissions have ""collapsed"". He said, ""The estimates keep dropping because key technologies keep getting cheaper. Solar electricity costs have fallen 80% in 10 years, and even more in favourable locations such as India and the Middle East. Wind costs are down around 60%, and batteries are 85% cheaper."" The challenge in translating the lessons from the energy transition lie in connecting ambitions collectively across energy, environment, industry, trade and treasury.

The Government said that its plans will be supported by the £280 billion provided as part of the government's 'Plan for Jobs' which is intended to safeguard jobs in every region and nation of the UK, with support now extended until March 2021. The question that needs to be asked is the extent to which those funds will go towards innovation and new development, rather than propping up the status quo.

Research from Energy Policy Tracker showed that most of the world's economies are spending on fossil fuels over clean energy through budgetary support, loans, guarantees and other fiscal mechanisms, entrenching the role of fossil fuels. Over 53% of all public COVID recovery funds have gone to energy intensive sectors. The funds flow to energy production and consumption through direct budgetary transfers, tax expenditure, loans, loan guarantees and various hybrid mechanisms. These combine with government policies that already existed before the pandemic and entrench high-carbon energy. A November report from IISD showed that G20 governments are still spending over half a trillion annually on gas, oil and coal. Throwing a couple of billion at small parts of the system are not going to achieve the change we want to see.

Effective system change requires long term planning, consistency in policy approaches and supportive financial and investment frameworks. No one can deny the effectiveness of this approach anymore, as we have seen the transformation of the electricity system and its economics over the last few years. For a long time, opponents argued that renewable energy would never be cheap enough, accessible enough, or integratable enough to constitute a large part of electricity generation. That has been proven to be patently untrue as Turner points out. But scaling up at sufficient speed needs commitment and it needs certainty.

The UK has taken a stand on climate action, and the return of the US to the Paris Agreement could result in countries representing over 60% of global emissions targeting net zero by 2050. With China committing to net zero by 2060, there really is a chance to achieve what we need and these commitments provide us with hope for the future. But complaints continue about the slow pace of action within the UNFCCC and on national agreements on international action on climate change.

UNEP's latest Emissions Gap Report shows how much further we must go. The 2020 Report showed a world on track to hit an increase in overall temperature by over 3 degrees by the end of the century. This is far above the Paris Agreement goal of 2° Celsius with the ambition of 1.5°.

Electricity is only part of the energy equation - we need to solve heating and transportation as well. CCS and hydrogen are going to need focus and support if we are to achieve our goals. In 2015 it was thought that internal combustion engines would still make up most vehicles on the roads in the 2050's, now the government has brought forward the ban on the sale of internal combustion cars to 2030. It is possible to achieve the climate goals and things can change fast, but we need to have consistent policies and approaches across the board.

Hydrogen may be the best solution for seasonal power storage, finally solving the energy system challenge, but it would require a rethink of our logistics networks, supply chains and our behavioural patterns. The post-COVID recovery provides a unique opportunity for the UK economy to position itself as a leader for the future. China may well dominate the existing battery supply chain but there is still space for new innovations and technologies to help us achieve our climate, technological and economic goals.

Once we have worked out way through the energy system, we're going to need further change in agriculture, industry and the economy. We've shown that we have the tools, the knowledge and the ability to achieve climate goals. What we don't have is consistency and commitment in policy and finance and governments are going to have to do a lot better if we want to achieve necessary change in the next ten years. And that means putting your money where your mouth is. As yet, the UK's Energy White Paper doesn't show us that.",Forbes,energy,,"['United Kingdom', 'United States', 'India', 'China']",Does The Investment Support The UK's Energy White Paper Goals?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/feliciajackson/2020/12/14/does-the-investment-support-the-uks-energy-white-paper-goals/,None,
11062451,2020-12-14,"I cover oil, gas, power, LNG markets, linking to human development.

""On one hand, the energy transition is real and here to stay. On the other hand, there are 280 million cars on the road in the U.S. today, 279 million of them running on oil, and the average lifespan of a vehicle is 12 years,"" Bob Maguire, managing director of Carlyle Group, October 2020.

For the U.S. oil & gas industry, the struggle through Covid-19 might just be the ""most unique year ever."" Thus, with the global economy set to contract 4.4% this year, extrapolating current problems into mid- and long-term forecasts should be met with skepticism. Even looking out a few decades from now, ""the end of oil & gas"" chant today is speculative, largely based on highly optimistic assumptions about alternatives and unproven technologies that have nowhere near taken root yet.

The reality is that even as we increasingly embrace renewables, oil & gas will remain essential for much longer than some are telling you. Shale has already installed America's ""energy independence"" since development took flight in 2008. Sunken prices and demand from the pandemic are no doubt serious issues (e.g., leading to asset write-downs) but there is no indication of any huge structural shift across energy markets. In short, the need for more oil & gas has not somehow just gone away.

With crude oil prices stuck at $35 to $40 a barrel for most of the past many months, producers have been doing all that they can to cut costs and ride out the storm. Although rising back to up over $3.00 per MMBtu as high demand winter kicked off in November, U.S. natural gas prices for the first half of this year were just $1.80, their lowest levels in over 30 years. The U.S. shale industry has therefore obviously seen curtailed production volumes.

But still, for the 2020 average, our crude output is expected to drop just 7%, with marketed gas falling 4% (Figure 1). This is actually pretty remarkable considering the calamity that all markets have been pushing through. Optimism has hardly vanished:

Hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") and horizontal drilling for oil & gas, which gives us 85% of U.S. supply, will remain essential because demand for these products will remain essential. An upward trend for the industry could be regained much sooner than some are telling you. U.S. crude production is now up to ~11.1 million b/d, the highest since March, with WTI prices on Friday at ~$47 on the vaccine rollout.

For example, independent researcher Rystad Energy reports that as oil prices improve with rebounding demand (not a surprise since oil has no material substitute), shale activity and output in North America are expected to dramatically rise again. Light tight oil production is projected to reach 13.6 million b/d by 2030, up from 8.2 million b/d this year. As the centerpiece play, output in the Permian basin in West Texas alone could soar 85-90% to over 8 million b/d by 2030.

In fact, Rystad is now warning about a lack of investment in new oil supply to meet rising needs. Because E&P investment in additional output has been understandably down this year (e.g., global oil demand is down 8% to 92 million b/d), we could see a price spike within three to five years. Especially since fields have a natural decline rate of 4-7% per year, a crucial new report from the International Energy Forum and the Boston Consulting Group just concluded the same warning about ""peak investment"" for oil and gas, hardly ""peak demand:""

""Industry investment will have to rise over the next three years by 25 percent yearly from 2020 levels to stave off a crisis...[and]....substantially greater sums will be needed by the end of the decade to ensure sufficient production to guarantee market stability.""

Rystad has oil prices increasing to a strong $70 by 2030 as demand growth renters the picture. U.S. oil use, of course, is unlikely to grow much from its current 19-21 million b/d, but projected absolute drops are overstated. Not just requiring a huge and costly infrastructure build-out, electric cars and other green technologies demand a mining boom that many environmental groups themselves oppose. Still too expensive and inconvenient, even huge percentage gains are unlikely to change the electric cars are a ""niche market"" reality for some time: ""U.S. will see 50% more electric cars by 2030: Fisker CEO,"" still putting them at just 2-3% of the total U.S. car fleet.

For natural gas, total North American shale gas supply has been at 78 Bcf/d this year, but Rystad reports that it could reach 123 Bcf/d by 2030. This nearly 60% growth in supply will clearly be needed. Even through the first half of this very difficult year, natural gas ranked as the fastest-growing source of electric power in the U.S., rising 9%, compared to 5% for renewables and 4% for nuclear.

U.S. gas generation has been setting records in 2020, even when our power demand has been down 10-15% because of the pandemic. In other words, gas power has been at historic heights at a time when it should have plummeted, reaffirmed by coal retirements and stagnant nuclear (Figure 2).

Looking forward, the push for energy policies that have been embraced by the progressive coastal elites of California, New York, and New England is a dangerous one. The apparent goal to increase the cost of energy while lowering system reliability, for instance, played out horribly in California in September.

Over the past 15-20 years, no other U.S. state has spent anywhere near the amount of money and forced more policy to ""get rid of oil & gas"" than California. Yet, oil (~45%) and gas (~30%) still meet a whopping 75% of the state's energy consumption, or even higher than the national average - I'd bet shockingly so to most.

Even more telling of more natural gas, California has a great mild weather advantage, where residents use half of the electricity of other states - but, gas has easily maintained its primary position in the power sector, at almost 45% of total generation this year. We must heed the reality check:

By far our main source of electricity at 40% of generation, U.S. natural gas demand could be much higher than some are telling you. For example, our National Renewable Energy Laboratory itself finds that the environmental goal to electrify transportation, buildings, and industry could surge U.S. electricity needs by as much as 65% by 2050 - an enormous shift since our power consumption has been flat for well over a decade.

Gloomy forecasts for gas like to ignore this pending leap in U.S. power consumption, but the fact remains: ""Deep Electrification' Means More Natural Gas."" Not just wanting a massive fleet of electricity-devouring cars, Joe Biden, for instance, agrees with President Trump and seeks a manufacturing and infrastructure boom, surely one that will require large amounts of energy input to occur.

This would clearly benefit oil & gas because they supply 69% of our energy needs, while wind and solar are less than 4%. Most ironically, this dominance means that renewables themselves are highly dependent on oil & gas as energy inputs for development and construction. Experts at the University of Michigan confirm: ""Shale Gas: A Game Changer for US Manufacturing.""

The fact that electrification, a manufacturing reshoring, and an infrastructure boom could very easily surge our need for primary energy (and electricity as a secondary source) is one that very few seem interested in talking about. Although we keep hearing about studies concluding that renewables are now the cheapest sources of energy, they too frequently ignore critical problems that manifest themselves in real-life application:

1) Wind and solar are intermittent, so they require an additional cost of backup ""spinning reserve"" (usually from low-cost gas or ""far more expensive"" batteries) - these gas plants are often subsidized by the system operator, an added cost for renewables that hardly ever gets incorporated in studies that promote them.

2) A much bigger wind and solar build-out will require costly and very hard-to-site high-voltage, long-distance transmission lines to get the power from the good resource areas to our population centers (e.g., Great Plains wind power brought to Chicago). Transmission lines often face more regulatory hurdles than pipelines.

3) As they continue to mature, cost reductions and more growth for renewables will not prove unlimited. And what will happen if/when the high subsidies disappear? How will renewables bring in huge tax revenues like oil & gas do? These are just few of the many questions that are never getting asked about the ""energy transition.""

Less gasoline derived from oil, for instance, will mean less tax revenues to build and maintain bridges and roads, as the industry provides tens of billions of dollars for governments across the country: ""Oil And Gas Revenues Drive Education Funding In New Mexico, Colorado."" Even for trying to displace oil, however, a transportation fuel that is still our main source of primary energy at 37% of supply, it also goes ignored that wind and solar, as sources of electricity, effectively have nothing to do with our efforts.

In 2019, the U.S. consumed over 400 million gallons of gasoline per day, a market that more wind and solar will not change. Electricity accounts for less than 1% of our oil demand and less than 40% of our energy demand. And Joe Biden's electric rail dream might already be dead even before it started: ""Want to fight climate change, Gov. Newsom? Stop the high-speed rail boondoggle."" And the lingering Covid-19 effects could actually turn people away from the public transportation that some policymakers want to force upon us to cut oil usage - and take away our personal mobility freedoms.

Let me be clear: Americans still vote, and I predict that voters will not stand for the high carbon taxes, excessive costs, and curtailed energy options (just to name a few) that some policymakers want to force upon us. Both political parties must work together to find a balanced energy-environment approach.

Looking forward, the U.S. oil & gas industry has been innovating throughout its 150-plus year life, and the future will be no different. The fracking revolution itself is the result of this constant evolution. We have to continually ask ourselves: what will be the next great advancement? This is why picking winners and losers with energy policy is not just unfair but could actually block our energy and environment goals. Leading electricity experts right down the street from me at Carnegie Mellon warned us about this long ago.

For example, for sustainability and net-zero targets, the advancement for oil & gas continues apace: ""Oil majors say progress 'significant' on upstream methane, carbon intensity."" As for the other major greenhouse gas, ""The U.S. Oil & Gas Industry Is Cutting Methane Emissions."" The International Energy Agency has reported that more gas is why the U.S. has lowered CO2 emissions faster than any other country ever. Just affirmed by Karen Harbert, CEO of the American Gas Association:

""Through the Natural Gas Sustainability Initiative, a joint effort with electric utilities, pipelines and producers, we have created industry-wide environmental, social, governance (ESG) reporting metrics. Natural gas utilities remain an excellent choice for investors and we will provide the data and metrics they need to show our commitment to progress on all ESG fronts.""

Net-zero carbon BP, for instance, plans to double its liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio by 2030. Shell is installing net-zero LNG cargoes to bring clean, modern energy to an overwhelming energy-deprived world where some three billion humans inexplicably still rely on biomass for energy (wood, dung, crop waste).

An LNG cargo can offset CO2 emissions from either the full lifecycle of the gas supply itself, including upstream gas production, liquefaction, shipping, and end-user combustion, or just a part of it. Total just delivered a net-zero LNG cargo to China, offset with Verified Carbon Standards emissions certificates financing a wind farm and a forest project. Some 8-10 carbon-neutral LNG cargoes have been sold so far, with more tenders in the works.

U.S. LNG shippers must also start to factor in how much coal their products will displace to lower greenhouse gas emissions, needing to better quantify the environmental benefits of their operations. When combusted, gas emits 50% less CO2 than coal and has far less criteria pollutants to clear hazy urban skies.

The truth is that the pushback on U.S. LNG exports is a pro-coal for Asia position. China and India, for instance, are still overwhelmingly coal-based economies. And the ASEAN bloc is also part of a global build-out that has 500,000 MW of coal power capacity planned or under construction - or about what Japan and Germany together have from all sources. U.S. LNG is absolutely essential to bringing a viable coal alternative to significantly lower emissions.

Indeed, an obvious wake-up call for the anti-LNG crowd: ""Thermal coal demand to rise in 2021.""

While our LNG exports 70% for the first half of this year because of low demand and prices globally, the great comeback has been won and we are now at record levels. In early-December U.S. LNG feed gas demand hit a staggering 11.5 Bcf/d. We are still on pace to become the largest seller by 2025 or before.

The Trump administration's LNG supply time extensions for seven LNG licenses to 2050 give our industry the ability to compete worldwide and provide security for longer-term contracts and assurance for investors. The hunger is clearly there because natural gas has much broader support than some are telling you: ""Natural gas viewed more positively than other fossil fuels across 20 global publics,"" with support from 70% of those polled.

Even new clean markets are emerging for gas: just out from The Wall Street Journal: ""Natural Gas, Propane Are Early Winners in Quest for Clean Ship Fuels.""",Forbes,energy,,"['California', 'United States', 'New England', 'New Mexico', 'Colorado', 'Chicago', 'Japan', 'India', 'Germany', 'China']",Don't Count Out The U.S. Oil & Gas Industry Just Yet,https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2020/12/13/dont-count-out-the-us-oil--gas-industry-just-yet/,None,
11066442,2020-12-17,"The European Union's future carbon border adjustment mechanism must mirror the EU's own carbon market price and structure in order to be compatible with WTO rules, says Pascal Canfin.

Pascal Canfin is a French MEP for the centrist Renew Europe group in the European Parliament, where he chairs the assembly's environment committee (ENVI). He spoke to EURACTIV's energy and environment editor, Frédéric Simon.

The European Commission has said it will apply a carbon border adjustment mechanism on countries that do not make sufficient commitments on climate change. How can the Commission determine what is sufficient? Would signing the Paris agreement, for example, be enough?

We must first go back to the objective of this measure. What we want in the European Parliament is a mechanism which mirrors the ETS - the EU carbon market - and which is therefore adopted by qualified majority. A tax would have to be approved by unanimity, which would complicate decision making. It would also risk being rejected by the WTO as a protectionist measure.

By contrast, the border adjustment mechanism that we want to put in place could be technically integrated into the ETS, there are several ways of doing that.

The second thing we want to avoid is ""carbon leakage"" whereby industries shift their production to countries where CO2 emissions are not priced. The sectors most affected are well-known, chiefly steel and cement.

What we want is a level playing field - but compared to what? European steel and cement producers are already facing additional production costs linked to the carbon constraint imposed on them by the ETS. These constraints will only increase with the EU's new climate targets for 2030.

Faced with these very real constraints, we have to compare with what other countries are doing. This is the question we must ask ourselves.

If on the opposite side, we have political commitments for 2060, that is not good enough. This is what China has done. Even though I welcome this political commitment, at present China does not impose a carbon price on steel production, for example.

Therefore, exempting China on the sole basis of this political commitment would not be serious. If I put myself in the shoes of a European steel or cement producer, I would not accept it. It doesn't solve the short-term problem.

How could an industrial sector in a country like China escape the future European mechanism?

The only two tools that can be objectified - and compatible with the WTO - is either an explicit price on carbon emissions, like we have in Europe with the ETS, or an equivalent price in terms of standards.

The concrete commitment that can be objectified is the price of carbon. In the future European mechanism, it will act as a lock by adjusting the cost in relation to an equivalent: for example standards at sectoral level. A standard is equivalent to an implicit carbon price. To achieve a certain level of performance, it allows determining which carbon price would have to be applied.

And to escape the future European mechanism, it would be necessary to demonstrate that a carbon price has indeed been applied to the sector concerned?

Yes of course. Otherwise, what would that mean? If we are satisfied with declarations of intentions that do not translate into facts, we would not protect our manufacturers from climate dumping.

Coming back to China, while its commitments are laudable from a diplomatic point of view, it is of no value from the point of view of industrial competition. Of course, I am delighted that China has made this commitment. But to escape the future European carbon borer adjustment mechanism, it has to be translated into reality. Otherwise, it is not concrete.

And among the tools to measure these commitments, there is only the carbon price or the equivalent in terms of standards.

How can we precisely quantify the carbon cost imposed on an industrialist in a foreign country? What elements of proof will they have to provide?

It's quite simple, there are several options that we have already started discussing in the European Parliament. For example, we can take the electricity mix of the country, that of the group targeted by the mechanism, or the electricity mix of the production site itself. That remains to be seen.

But this information is very easily traceable. If you choose the country's electricity mix, this is easily available information, and if it is a company's site that is targeted, there are contracts and invoices, so it's very simple.

Then this should be applied to the carbon content of the products you import. If, for example, we have an electricity mix with a given CO2 intensity ""x"" and a carbon content ""y"", we make a simple proportional calculation and apply a price. The resulting price would be Europe's carbon price minus what might have already been paid locally. From that moment, we then have a level playing field.

The next question is what to do with the income generated by this adjustment mechanism. And there are basically two logics, two ways of approaching this that we must reconcile.

The first is the environmental logic according to which part of the revenue would go to finance the ecological transition of the countries concerned, especially the poorest countries. The second logic is that part of the income goes to finance the repayment of the European recovery plan - or parts of it, probably the green chapter.

In the end, it will be necessary to find the right compromise between these two logics so that the mechanism is WTO-compatible. If the proceeds only go towards the EU recovery plan, without traceability, with no environmental objectives and without any returns to certain countries, especially the poorest, I think we have to be concerned.

So there will have to be a balance between the two and I will work on it on my side in Parliament.

The biggest steel producers are multinationals with production sites in several countries. How can the carbon border adjustment mechanism be applied to this type of globalised group without penalising production sites located in Europe? I am thinking for example of ArcelorMittal.

It is precisely the opposite: if Europe increases the price of carbon without putting in place a mechanism that prevents climate dumping, then a foreign production site will automatically become more competitive than a European production site of the same group.

And so without a carbon border adjustment mechanism, there is precisely a risk of carbon leakage and relocation of production outside the EU. This would be doubly counterproductive - first from an economic and industrial point of view, and secondly from an environmental point of view because we would relocate production to countries which have lower environmental standards than us. So it's a double loss, that's precisely what we want to avoid.

It is also for this reason that the compatibility of the mechanism with WTO rules is essential: we do not want to enter into a trade war under any circumstances. I recently had discussions with Chinese officials on the subject as well as with the new US administration.

The message must be clear: Europe is not entering a logic of green protectionism or trade war. The mechanism we are proposing is neither arbitrary nor unilateral - on the contrary, we want it to be compatible with the WTO. And as long as it is compatible with the WTO, it is also compatible with the rules that we have set ourselves at European level, and that the Chinese and Americans have accepted.

So rather than starting a trade war, on the contrary, we are playing the game of multilateralism.

What is WTO-compatibility based on exactly? Is it based on the fact that the mechanism is linked to the price of carbon on the ETS?

Indeed, one of the elements is that the structure of the mechanism must be as close as possible to the EU carbon market. The fact that this is not a tax, and that it applies to both European and imported products, are essential and favourable elements here with regards to the WTO.

The second element is the purpose of the mechanism: if the aim is to protect the environment, and the legal basis is linked to environmental objectives, we demonstrate to the WTO that the mechanism is linked to a climate goal that is recognised by the WTO and not linked to customs duties which are aimed at financing other objectives.

The heart of WTO compatibility is that the scope must mirror the ETS mechanism. And that raises the question of free CO2 quotas for European manufacturers because we cannot have both border protection and free quotas.

This is where a smart adjustment will have to be found, for example by phasing out free quotas at the same time as the border adjustment mechanism is being put in place. The same tonne of carbon emitted by a European installation cannot be covered both by the carbon border adjustment mechanism and by free allowances because this would be a double compensation that is not compatible with the WTO.

In any case, WTO compatibility is a total red line: without it, we are entering a trade war logic and there will be no majority in the European Parliament to support the mechanism.",EURACTIV,energy,,['China'],MEP Canfin: EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism 'is not a tax',https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/interview/mep-canfin-eus-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-is-not-a-tax/,None,
11080789,2020-12-28,"From the changes the Biden administration could bring to U.S. national security and defense contractors to the prospect of rising tensions with China and Iran and more grey zone conflicts, here are the issues that Forbes defense contributors expect to shape 2021.

Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute

THE BIG TREND: Great-power competition with China becomes a bipartisan cause. The era of Sino-American engagement is over. Security experts in both parties now agree China is a threat to America's future, and must be the main focus of U.S. military preparations.

THE UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM: Biden barely cuts weapons spending. That's what usually goes first when the budget tightens, especially under Democratic presidents, but there are no obvious program kills this time around and the joint force is overdue for a refresh.

THE MISPLACED ASSUMPTION: Biden is as opposed to foreign military intervention as Trump was. Actually, he supported intervening in the Balkans in 1999, in Afghanistan in 2001, in Iraq in 2002 and in Libya and Syria during the Obama years.

THE BOLD PREDICTION: Taiwan becomes a flashpoint as Beijing increases military pressure on the island. China's effort to gain control of Taiwan the way it seized control in Hong Kong forces Washington to decide whether it is willing to confront a nuclear-armed state close to its home turf.

WHAT TO WATCH: Who Biden appoints to Pentagon technology jobs. Will they press the search for non-traditional sources of innovation and disruptive technologies, or be content to just tighten terms and conditions on the existing community of military suppliers?

David Hambling, defense technology journalist

THE BIG TREND: AI is now reaching a tipping point and we are going to see a profusion of AI-enabled weapon systems and unmanned vehicles, on air, sea and land, underwater and in space. These will have profound implications for the ways wars are fought -- not just the fast-moving tactical battlespace but in larger fields like warfighting strategy. No one has any idea how this is going to pan out.

WHAT TO WATCH: A surge in armed drone exports from Turkey on the back of Azerbaijan's success using Turkish drones against Armenia, with parallel expansions in Chinese and Israeli exports. The U.S., newly unfettered by international rules and keen to find exports for the MQ-9 Reaper also stokes the market. Expect new drones, new weapons and new customers -- and quite possibly new conflicts by those emboldened by their purchases.

THE UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM: Winning in the grey zone -- situations short of outright war -- will become ever more important. Whether it's cyberattacks, unattributable drone strikes, non-lethal targeting of government personnel or disabling vessels without shooting, those with the best means to win a conflict without escalating to a shooting match will come out on top.

THE MISPLACED ASSUMPTION: The Azeris won the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict simply because they used drones. Any states that simply throw drones at the opposition are likely to be disappointed: success is the result of a well-constructed 'system of systems' to target and exploit enemy weaknesses.

THE BOLD PREDICTION: After 60 years, directed energy weapons finally make their first kill in a real conflict. Press releases and video are put out, the media go crazy, while analysts trying to point out that the weapon did not make any difference are drowned out in the clamor.

David Deptula, retired USAF lieutenant general and dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies

THE BIG TREND: Russia and China will escalate very quickly expecting an easy time with a Biden administration, which will be under immense internal pressure in the Democratic Party to spend more on social entitlements, with the progressive wing aiming to take that additional funding out of the defense budget.

WHAT TO WATCH: Weapons programs that could be significantly negatively impacted by pressure from the left wing of the Democratic Party include the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, B-21 bomber, Advanced Battle Management System, Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), KC-46 and F-35, as well as shipbuilding programs.

THE UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM: North Korea resumes nuclear weapons and ICBM testing.

THE MISPLACED ASSUMPTION: The notion that a return to the JCPOA by the Biden administration would ameliorate the situation with Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Iran will no doubt escalate as well with the expectation that a Biden administration will forgive all of their sins. The Obama-Biden administration's dealings with Iran were unimpressive -- they were poorly conceived, strategically short sighted, and predicated on the notion that a regime with an unbroken 40 years running track record of murder, treachery, terrorism and deceit would somehow reform itself magically. There are no historical precedents for such magical outcomes.

THE BOLD PREDICTION: There will be major trouble next year as pandemic economic impacts bite in Russia, China and Iran. All three regimes will see an opportunity with a new administration amid political discord across the U.S., deep cuts to the U.S. defense budget and as a huge need balloons for all three regimes to distract their population from their own woes. It is an open question as to which of these three regimes is the least stable. The less stable the regime, the bigger risks it will take as it has more to win and less to lose by taking risks. China makes a move on Taiwan -- not necessarily a conventional invasion, but an unconventional set of actions to solidify their sovereign claim on Taiwan.

Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the consultancy Teal Group

THE BIG TREND: Big is better in aerospace at large. Bigger companies, for the most part, are better positioned to survive this crisis. With just one or two exceptions, when we look at risks to the aerospace supply chain, it's almost always in the third or fourth tier. There, companies are simply more vulnerable, in part due to a lack of portfolio diversity, but also due to inadequate scale or limited access to capital.

Meanwhile defense is defensive. The pandemic has had absolutely no impact on defense budgets or markets, and in some cases there has been an upside as a result of stimulus spending. Defense primes like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin have been safe spots in the economy. And for suppliers, very simply, the more defense work in their portfolio, the better positioned they are to get through the civil downturn.

Raytheon Technologies sums up both of these big trends. The merger between United Technologies (itself the result of several aviation mega-mergers) and Raytheon was finalized this year, creating the world's largest aero supplier company, and one of the best positioned. Thanks to Raytheon, a formerly pure-play defense company, all the UTC supplier companies are now far better sheltered from the civil markets storm.

Vikram Mittal, assistant professor of systems engineering at the U.S. Military Academy

The BOLD PREDICTION: Defense acquisition is going to break away from traditional acquisition which moves at a snail's pace -- new processes will be created to move at the speed of technology. The Pentagon will keep the traditional processes for vehicles and larger items, but smaller items will have a new sequence.

THE MISPLACED ASSUMPTION: That defense technology has been overly focused on counterinsurgency. It's becoming more and more apparent through the lessons learned that technology was not the issue in Iraq and Afghanistan.

WHAT TO WATCH: We're on the cusp of an arm's race in hypersonic weapons.

Bryan Clark, director of the Center for Defense Concepts and Technology at the Hudson Institute

THE BIG TREND: An information-centric U.S. military. Information has always been important in warfare, but will accelerate in the coming year as initiatives like Joint All-Domain Command and Control and Advanced Battle Management System gain steam and the services intensify their data-sharing demonstrations in the Army's Project Convergence and Navy's Project Overmatch. The renewed emphasis on command, control and communications and improved information flow is only partly about high-end warfighting. The focus of adversaries such as China, Russia and Iran on gray-zone operations below the level of war places a premium on U.S. forces understanding an opponent's patterns of life and conducting precise effects that avoid escalation. With a new administration likely to constrain defense spending and interested in new ways to compete, improving information may be a more cost-effective investment than traditional manned combatant ships and aircraft.

WHAT TO WATCH: The DoD's emphasis on ownership costs. The U.S. military services' plans, and the recent NDAA and appropriations bill from Congress, continue to favor large, multimission ships, aircraft and troop formations. Although these units are easier to manage and support than more disaggregated forces, they incur operations and sustainment expenses that are rising much faster than inflation and are already crowding out procurement spending. Look for DoD to begin emphasizing affordability in some of its force design changes to try to arrest this trend.

THE UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM: Adaptability will be more important than speed-to-fielding for new weapons systems. Delivering a new cutting-edge weapon, electromagnetic system, or platform rapidly to an operational commander isn't very useful if it only talks to a small number of other systems or can't easily be carried or supported in theater. Prioritizing adaptability and interoperability may mean accepting a less-exquisite technology, but one that can afford commanders a wider range of options in an environment where decision superiority will be more important to success than attrition. The pace and quality of US decision-making will be a greater contributor to success than lethality in confrontations short of large-scale, high-intensity war-such as today's gray-zone operations.

THE BOLD PREDICTION: The U.S. military services will accelerate early or delayed retirement of older platforms and systems - sometimes in the face of Congressional objections - because of the need to control sustainment costs and transform in response to China's military modernization. Maintenance costs for aircraft begin to increase rapidly after about 15 years of service; ship maintenance costs increase as well at 15 years, but at a lower rate. DoD will retire high-cost platforms to free up funds to develop and procure next generation platforms and sustain the rest of the force.

Eric Tegler, freelance aerospace and defense journalist

THE BIG TREND: Look for digital engineering, prototyping and production processes to receive more investment and attention. DoD's high-profile efforts to elevate digital engineering -- including acknowledgement of building/flying its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) prototype -- are meshing with the pandemic-related pressure on aerospace companies to innovate faster and more cheaply with fewer people.

WHAT TO WATCH: Propulsion technology advancements will be watched closely and sought after in the defense and commercial aerospace realms. Hypersonic propulsion research and experimentation is seeing technical progress matched by recognition among scientists, researchers and government that current information sharing, cross pollination efforts and follow-through need big improvement. On the commercial side continued development of hybrid electric propulsion will attract further investment but may be diluted by new developments in hydrogen combustion among others.

THE UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM: Despite frequent commentary on the changing patterns of public behavior arising from the pandemic, aerospace and defense companies will seek to return their employees to on-site work routines to compensate for lost productivity, fractured company culture and increasing risk from underreported security breaches (national security and commercial intelligence) that have come with remote work.

THE MISPLACED ASSUMPTION: Aerospace and defense firms will not see an uptick in international business demand or desire for increased cooperation in cross-national projects due to the arrival of a new presidential administration. In addition to an uneven global economic recovery, a slate of new and retrograde executive policy priorities will increase the complexity of doing business with American firms and slow the pace of innovation.

THE BOLD PREDICTION: The need to reprogram funding in a flat defense budget environment will lead to expanded congressional briefings on advanced U.S. weapons and space systems to court support. Subsequent public revelations about these programs will emerge - from the Air Force's NGAD to currently on-orbit offensive space assets (controlled by the new established Space Force) to a variety of novel area-denial systems and technologies designed to keep humans and adversaries' platforms at standoff distances. Under-sea and electromagnetic spectrum capabilities will see some daylight as well.",Forbes,energy,,"['United States', 'Taiwan', 'Iran', 'China', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Washington (state)', 'Hong Kong', 'Beijing', 'Syria', 'Libya', 'North Korea', 'Israel', 'Azerbaijan', 'Armenia']",What's Ahead In Defense In 2021,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/12/28/whats-ahead-in-defense-in-2021/,None,
11089009,2020-12-29,"There's a feverish discussion under way among foreign policy experts on what the President-elect should do about Turkey. It really has to be high up on his list of urgent worries, they seem to believe. Not least because Donald Trump's approach was so incoherent and so apparently unfocused. That is, other than his rather arbitrarily indulgent attitude towards Recep Tayyip Erdogan (except for the one incident of jailed evangelist Andrew Brunson - more of which later). In the Trump era, Erdogan ramped up his egregious repression of civil society in Turkey, grounds enough for White House disapproval. His supine justice system continued to stifle outspoken media and journalists, imprison Kurdish politicians, persecute opposition voices like prominent businessman Osman Kavala. Here is a horrifying list of just this year's abuses

But Erdogan also interfered militarily abroad not once, not twice, but thrice - in Syria, Libya and Armenia-Azerbaijan. He has done all that without a peep from Washington. As well as acquire Russian S-400 missiles and bully Greece with warships. Clearly, something needs to be done, goes the argument, to stabilize Nato's eastern flank and bring Turkey back in line.

Some say, Biden must find a way to make nice with Turkey in order to do that. Here is a thoroughly competent essay that ends with the line, ""the purpose of our actions should be to peel Ankara away from Moscow, rather than push it deeper in its embrace.""

Written by a respected policy wonk in Europe, it provides lots of excellent background and context on Turkey's relations with Russia, Europe, and the US. What it doesn't do is suggest anything concrete. What exactly should the West do to butter up Erdogan without buttressing his domestic power or freeing him to spread Turkish power abroad - thereby boosting his popularity at home and enhancing his brutish march toward full-blown state Putinism? Above all, the paper doesn't address the central issue - why should the US make nice with Erdogan at all? Oddly enough, very few of the esteemed global experts expounding on the topic of Turkey deal with this. Does Turkey have much geo-strategic value anymore, and if so what and how much?

One could argue, like the above article, that the West needs to repair the alliance in order to keep Moscow and Ankara apart. But then you'd have to itemize the concrete benefits of doing so. As the author notes, the two nations' interests are diagonally opposed in each of the conflict areas yet they've arrived consistently at a stable modus vivendi. In Syria, Putin supports the regime while Erdogan controls an enclave/safe-haven for the rebels. In Libya, the two have basically divided the country between them. In Karabagh, both leaders have emerged triumphant as hegemons on opposing sides. As a result they're even more unassailable at home, offering citizens imperial nostalgia in place of a decent economy, basic human rights, or Covid competence. For sure, the West shouldn't allow that kind of 'post-liberal' order (the author's phrase) to succeed and proliferate. It will ultimately affect the stability and prosperity of the West and allies if, for example, Moscow and Ankara dominate major oil-resource locations such as Azerbaijan and Libya among other places. So the argument goes. But in that case, why not just make life difficult for Erdogan and indeed for Putin and other leaders of such regimes?

Here the crucial disparity of interests between Europe and the US becomes salient. It matters less domestically in the short-term to America, being self-sufficient in fuel, which anti-democratic ogre acts as hegemon over global oil supplies. But it does matter to Europe more immediately owing to the EU's dependence on foreign pipelines and deliveries from abroad. It becomes America's problem only if the US still intends to lead and protect the Western world and its global geo-strategic perimeter. For the US to prosper, it must create a blanket of protection and prosperity around those areas of the world that embrace its values. That includes Europe. In order to do so, it's time to confront manifest adversaries adversarially. Moscow has in recent years perpetrated the recent great hack via Solar Winds, attacked American diplomats with directed-energy weapons, interfered in elections, launched a global assassination campaign and much else. Enough with resets. The new Cold War is here. It's time to engage in it fully.

Where does that leave Turkey? What about Nato's eastern flank? Ankara's historical role in the alliance was to act as a buffer between Soviet power and the exposed oil-rich Middle East. As well as the Mediterranean. Times have changed. Foreign oil will soon lose its paramount strategic importance, even for Europe (which can, with US help, bridge the vulnerable years). Therefore the Mideast matters less, as does Turkey's role in helping as guardian. Turkey's stability matters less too, except as a potential funnel for overwhelming refugee flows - not such a big problem anymore. Israel seems perfectly capable of defending itself, so that's not an issue. Why, then, should the West go easy on Ankara?

There's no question that any openly hostile Western policies will only entrench Erdogan - at first. Should that be a top consideration? Not really. At this point, anyway, the US and Europe have become all-purpose bogeys for Turkish politicians to invoke. Hard to believe but his former ally and one-time Premier, Ahmet Davutoglu, recently criticized Erdogan for not being the old tough guy and instead, these days, serving America's interests. The point is, the US will be scapegoated whatever it does. So there's nothing to lose in being firm. Equally, though, the question arises - if Turkey is so strategically unimportant, why bother with punishing policies and what would that be anyway?

As the world witnessed when President Trump imposed pro-tem sanctions on Turkey for jailing the American evangelist, Andrew Brunson, nothing exposes Erdogan's position more acutely than economic free-fall. The Turkish lira fell steeply. Erdogan released Brunson. Equally, nothing will poison the country's view of his populist military adventures abroad more quickly than a collapsed economy. Yes the Ottomans had a long history of empire. But the Republic that came after survived through sustained non-intervention in its neighborhood for almost a century. Erdogan launched first into Syria and now Turkish streets are full of indigent and desperate Syrian refugees. As a result, his party lost the all-important Istanbul municipal elections. Depending on the conditions, Turks will either remember the Ottoman centuries of imperial might or, instead, its long miserable decline that made the Republic's isolationism preferable. Ergo, if necessary, economic sanctions will work against Erdogan.

What will make them necessary? Too much cozying up to Moscow, perhaps? In truth, however much he does so, Russo-Turkish strategic interests are so inherently opposed that they're easily destabilized. Cozying up to Tehran? That's not about to happen either because those strategic goals, too, are inherently polar. What else? Power-projection across the Mediterranean? Yes, that could be a trigger, but one that would require the U.S. to spur the paralytic EU into action. The truth is, if Erdogan stayed in line with Nato and Western interests, none of his actions abroad would yet merit harsh counter-measures, though they come close. But the domestic repressions combined with foreign adventurism, the S-400 missiles, the encouragement of Islamist groups, the flirting with the authoritarian regime bloc, all do add up to adversarial status. The Biden White House would likely deal with Erdogan firmly but the task of just rebuilding foreign affairs institutions will keep them busy for a while.",Forbes,energy,,"['Moscow', 'Ankara', 'United States', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Kavala', 'Greece', 'Azerbaijan', 'Israel', 'Istanbul', 'Tehran']",What Will Biden Do About Turkey's President Erdogan?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melikkaylan/2021/12/29/what-will-biden-do-about-turkeys-president-erdogan/,None,
11089011,2020-12-30,"Joan Michelson is a career coach, public speaker and podcast host.

""This is really a pivotal moment for businesses, for brands to behave the best way possible as citizens and to contribute in the best way they can for the public good, rather than to be seen as a good company,"" Anne Bahr Thompson, branding expert and author of ""Do Good: Embracing Brand Citizenship to Fuel Both Purpose and Profit, told me on my podcast, Green Connections Radio. ""Being a citizen at this moment is far more important.""

Thompson's firm's Culture Q research ""confirmed that customers unequivocally are demanding more value, more service, better ethics and a greater focus on sustainability and social good,"" as she wrote in her book. ""Brand citizenship is a way of doing business - from a company's core purpose; to its delivery of good and services; to its responsibility to its employees, community, the environment and the world - that people trust, believe in and rely on...all with the aim of earning profits that are maintainable over the long term.""

As we reinvent our economy emerging from the wreckage of the pandemic, we need to remember we are also facing the converging crises of racial injustice, rampant inequality, and the devastating impacts of climate change. It's not over when everyone's receives a covid vaccine.

This is what investors call environment, social and governance - or ESG - factors and it's good business too. The Financial Times' FT Adviser reported in mid-November that, ""Companies with better environmental, social and governance ratings had better returns in almost every month of 2020 so far.""

As financial data company Factset put it in their year-end review, ""2020 is the year of ESG."" It looks more like 2020 ushered in the Era of ESG.

So how can leaders reinvent their organizations for the new ESG Era?

Here are six questions leaders can ask about their organizations' policies, culture and values from experts I interviewed this year:

Where does ESG direct our focus to?: Investopedia defines ESG as: ""Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward of nature. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a company's leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.""

What is your relationship to your customers?: ""It's time to step back and figure out what your relationship with your customers is. How do you communicate messages of togetherness...empathy and compassion that are so vital in this moment?"" Thompson said. Are you really listening and responding to your customers?

How generous are you?: It's about a generosity of spirit as well as of dollars and policies. Diane Irving, long-time human resources executive told me, ""Is this a generous organization or is this not a generous organization? You get a reputation."" This includes generosity with your team -- from offering generous paid leave and health insurance policies, to cutting senior executive pay in a downturn before laying people off, to offering remote work flexibility long-term - as well as being generous with your customers, suppliers and the wider community.

Are you trustworthy?: In addition to building trust with your team, you need your customers and suppliers to trust you too. The pandemic caused organizations to reconfigure their supply chains, as Christopher Cordaro, Chief Investment Officer of wealth management firm RegentAtlantic, told me. Trust requires transparency, not spin. Trust requires authenticity, not ""corporate speak."" Can your stakeholders trust you?

Do you value diversity - of ideas and experience as well as of people?: Look at your organization's data. Listen to your team. Your customers come from all walks of life, men and women, all ethnic groups, all ages and stages, all socioeconomic levels. So should your decision makers. There are numerous examples of product failures due to decision makers not relating to their markets. Or, too few new ideas resulting in crises, such as in the 2008 financial crisis, which the International Monetary Fund attributed to ""groupthink.""

Lack of diversity can be life-threatening too, as Dr. Corinne Post of Lehigh University and her colleagues on an extensive, ground-breaking study of the medical products industry found earlier this year. ""Severe product problems that injure or kill consumers are recalled much faster when there are females on the board,"" Post said. Specifically, medical products that were determined to be highly defective - from vaccines to treatments to stents - were recalled 28 days faster when two or more women were on the company's board. A lot of people can die in that 28-day lapse (more than 65,000 from December 1 -28, 2020 from covid-19).

How are you driving the debate?: From infrastructure to insurance, regulations and public policy affect much more than just your taxes. Inconsistent or outdated public policy can destroy your company and the environment, and cost lives, as we've experienced firsthand in the inept federal government response to this pandemic. As the planet continues to warm, sea levels continue to rise, and more extreme weather events escalate, leaders must take a stand on energy- and environment-related policies to protect their employees, customers, suppliers and operations.

The new year ushers in a massive paradigm shift in every area of society triggered by the convergence of so many massive crises at once. Within every crisis is opportunity, though, so leaders have a chance to rise to the occasion. We can put the economy back together differently and be better citizens, both personally and as employers, and in a way that is better for people, planet and profit.

Asking yourself these six important questions is a valuable place to start.",Forbes,energy,,[],6 Questions Leaders Need To Ask Post-Covid. Welcome To The ESG Era,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2021/12/30/6-questions-leaders-need-to-ask-post-covid-welcome-to-the-esg-era/,None,

Yesterday, Libya's National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported 87 new cases, taking the total to 1,791 out of which there are 1,358 active cases with 385 recoveries and 48 deaths.

The cases are spread across the country but with the largest numbers now concentrated in Libya's south.

11397881,2020-05-20,"In her first briefing to the UN Security Council yesterday since taking over the role of Acting head of UNSMIL and Acting SRSG, Stephanie Williams, said that just when we think that the bottom has been reached in Libya, we somehow manage to achieve new depths of violence, heartlessness, and impunity.

No ceasefire observed

She said there has been no lull in the fighting between forces of the internationally recognized government led by Faiez Serraj in Tripoli and forces led by Khalifa Haftar. Fighting has escalated with an unprecedented increase in indirect fire in urban areas and a growing tide of suffering for civilians, she added.

Internally displaced

As a result of the intensifying armed hostilities, coupled with the dire socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and including the loss of employment and livelihoods, a million people are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. This includes 400,000 internally displaced Libyans, along with 654,000 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Since the attack on Tripoli started, 201,000 Libyans were forced to flee their homes, mostly in and around the capital, she reported.

Unbearable conditions

Williams said that the two million residents of Tripoli - are experiencing a most abnormal and terrifying existence, under almost constant bombardment, frequent water and electricity cuts and compounded by restricted movement as a result of preventive COVID-19 measures, rendering the whole situation unbearable for the majority to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan in peace.

Continued military build-up, foreign interference and arrival of mercenaries

An alarming military build-up as a result of the uninterrupted dispatch by the foreign backers of increasingly sophisticated and lethal weapons and the recruitment of more mercenaries to both sides of the conflict continues, she reported.

Emboldened by recent military successes, the Tripoli government showed reluctance to reciprocate a unilaterally declared cessation of all military activities announced by the LNA on 29 April.

The control of the strategic Wutiya airbase by Tripoli forces may trigger further escalation, turning the Libyan conflict into a pure proxy war. As has been the case on a number of occasions, there was direct involvement of foreign parties in this operation, either with UAVs or the presence on the ground of air defence systems, in blatant violation of the arms embargo, Williams said.

Continued attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure

Since 24 April, Tripoli, and in particular Mitiga airport, has been subjected to nearly non-stop daily shelling. This included heavy-artillery bombardment and grad rocket attacks launched by pro-LNA forces impacted downtown Tripoli, including the seaport and in the vicinity of the Foreign Ministry, the Turkish embassy and the residence of Italy's ambassador to Libya, with at least two civilians killed and three others injured. Another round of shelling on targets in and around Mitiga by General Haftar's forces on 15 May hit three warehouses of the Central Committee for Municipal Elections, destroying a sizable amount of electoral material.

Williams called again for the immediate cessation of attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure whilst calling on the Tripoli government to restore the civilian nature of Mitiga airport.

Increased civilian casualties

Williams reported that between 1 April and 18 May, UNSMIL documented at least 248 civilian casualties (58 killed and 190 injured), an 89 per cent increase compared to the total civilian casualties recorded for the first three months of this year.

Covid-19

With regards to Libya's Coronavirus situation, Williams reminded that according to WHO, the peak has not yet reached Libya and the risk of an intensification of the outbreak remains very high. It should also be noted that the low count of positive cases is proportional to the low testing capacity, contact tracing in the country, and fear of social stigmatization, she reiterated.

Economy

On the economic situation, Williams reported that the country's oil blockade has already cost it over USD four billion and a resultant expected budget deficit of 26 billion dinars in 2020. As a result, Libya's Tripoli-based Central Bank of Libya has imposed austerity measures including limits on foreign exchange. All of this has led to a loss of income, food shortages and price spikes, including supply chain disruptions. The parallel market exchange rate has increased from 4.1 LYD to the US dollar in January to 6.1 today, which further impacts people's purchasing power. Many of the gains from the economic reforms enacted in 2018 have been erased, Williams said.

In conclusion, she said that with the massive influx of weaponry, equipment and mercenaries to the two sides, Libya's war will intensify, broaden and deepen with devastating consequences for the Libyan people. She called for the application of consistent and credible pressure on those regional and international actors that are fueling the Libyan conflict.

Let me open with best wishes to our Muslim colleagues on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan. Allow me also to congratulate Estonia for its Presidency of the Security Council this month.

I had hoped to be able to deliver a more positive report to you today but unfortunately, just when we think that the bottom has been reached in Libya, we somehow manage to achieve new depths of violence, heartlessness, and impunity. Despite our determined efforts and the Secretary-General's plea for an immediate ceasefire to allow Libyans to respond to the common threat of COVID-19, I regret to report that there has been no lull in the fighting between the Government of National Accord (GNA) forces and General Haftar's ""Libyan National Army,"" also known as the ""Libyan Arab Armed Forces"" (LAAF.) Instead, fighting has escalated with an unprecedented increase in indirect fire in urban areas and a growing tide of suffering for civilians.

For nearly 15 months following the launch of General Haftar's attack on Tripoli in April of 2019, armed conflict has been raging in and around some of Libya's most densely populated areas. As a result of the intensifying armed hostilities, coupled with the dire socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and including the loss of employment and livelihoods, a million people are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. This includes 400,000 internally displaced Libyans, along with 654,000 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. In the last one year alone, since the attack on Tripoli started, 201,000 Libyans were forced to flee their homes, mostly in and around the capital.

While people around the world are adjusting to the new normal of living with a global pandemic, millions of Libyans - most notably the two million residents of Tripoli - are experiencing a most abnormal and terrifying existence, under almost constant bombardment, frequent water and electricity cuts and compounded by restricted movement as a result of preventive COVID-19 measures, rendering the whole situation unbearable for the majority to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan in peace. We continue to witness an alarming military build-up as a result of the uninterrupted dispatch by the foreign backers of increasingly sophisticated and lethal weapons, not to mention the recruitment of more mercenaries to both sides of the conflict.

After their successful bid to retake six cities on the coastal road west of Tripoli in April, GNA forces are now seeking to roll back the LNA's foothold in southern Tripoli by forcing the redeployment of resources and disrupting their supply lines from the nearby city of Tarhouna. Emboldened by these recent successes, the GNA showed reluctance to reciprocate a unilaterally declared cessation of all military activities announced by the LNA on 29 April on the occasion of Ramadan. On 5 May, GNA forces initiated operations to seize control of the Wutiya airbase but were initially repelled by UAVs and snipers, resulting in dozens of fatalities. After repeated attempts, supported by multiple airstrikes conducted by drones, GNA forces took control of the airbase yesterday, on 18 May. The control of this strategic airbase may trigger further escalation, turning the Libyan conflict into a pure proxy war. As has been the case on a number of occasions, we witnessed the direct involvement of foreign parties in this operation, either with UAVs or the presence on the ground of air defence systems, in blatant violation of the arms embargo.

Since 24 April, Tripoli, and in particular Mitiga airport, has been subjected to nearly non-stop daily shelling. On 7 May, heavy-artillery bombardment and grad rocket attacks launched by pro-LNA forces impacted downtown Tripoli, including the seaport and in the vicinity of the Foreign Ministry, the Turkish embassy and the residence of Italy's ambassador to Libya, with at least two civilians killed and three others injured. Another round of shelling on targets in and around Mitiga by General Haftar's forces on 15 May hit three warehouses of the Central Committee for Municipal Elections, destroying a sizable amount of electoral material. Once again, we call for the immediate cessation of attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure whilst calling on the GNA to restore the civilian nature of Mitiga airport.

Military operations in and around Tarhouna caused new displacement and negatively impacted humanitarian access to the city. I am concerned about GNA UAV attacks over the past two months on vehicles travelling between Mazdah and Tarhouna as well as in Bani Walid which caused collateral damage to vehicles carrying non-combat related items like food, goods, and fuel and resulted in civilian casualties.

Since my last briefing, the al Khadra Hospital which was assigned to receive patients infected with COVID-19, was hit on four separate days by LNA rockets, along with the Royal Hospital, the Field Medical Support Centre in Tariq al-Matar, and the Weryemma polyclinic, causing the facilities to be evacuated. On 16 May, shelling carried out by General Haftar's forces struck a shelter for internally displaced persons and migrants in Tripoli's al-Furnaj district. At least seven persons were killed and 17 injured, including women and children. This is not the first time this camp has been targeted. On 10 May, an armed group opened fire inside the intensive care unit in al-Jalla hospital in Benghazi, damaging equipment, while the Tripoli Central Hospital sustained damage as a result of LNA rocket attacks, launched by pro-LNA forces. I would be remiss not to reiterate that such attacks violate International Humanitarian Law and may amount to war crimes.

Between 1 April and 18 May, UNSMIL documented at least 248 civilian casualties (58 killed and 190 injured), an 89 per cent increase compared to the total civilian casualties recorded for the first three months of this year. The vast majority of the total civilian casualties are attributed to forces affiliated to the LNA. Those guilty of crimes under international law must be brought to justice.

We are also concerned by attacks on civilians, desecration of corpses, retribution, including looting, robberies and torching of public and private properties, in western coastal towns recently seized by GNA forces. On 14 April, following the GNA forces' takeover of the city of Surman, the Martyr Othman Hamza Company, affiliated with the GNA, broke into Surman prison and unlawfully released 401 prisoners. In Tarhouna, on 5 April, the LNA-affiliated armed group 9th Brigade killed at least nine civilians and demolished seven houses, after forcibly evicting families from their homes and abducting seven women, whose fate remains unknown.

Social media is another theatre of the Libyan conflict. Building on the workshops we ran last year to stem incitement and the use of hateful rhetoric in the media, UNSMIL organized a virtual forum in April with nearly 30 prominent Libyan traditional and social media figures from across the spectrum. We were pleased to see the participants agree to establish a hate speech observatory under the auspices of UNSMIL and to produce a Code of Ethics.

COVID-19 compounds existing insecurity in addition to exacerbating longstanding vulnerabilities. The UN System is hard at work to assist national authorities, including through the provision of supplies, equipment, and training. Testing capacity has been scaled up. There are now five operational laboratories in the country, up from two, but more are needed, including the qualified personnel to operate them.

As of 18 May, there were 65 confirmed cases, including three COVID-related deaths that were reported across Libya. According to WHO, the peak has not yet reached Libya and the risk of an intensification of the outbreak remains very high. It should also be noted that the low count of positive cases is proportional to the low testing capacity, contact tracing in the country, and fear of social stigmatization.

Although national authorities have provided frequent updates on financial pledges to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including on the purchase of medical equipment and the payment of salaries to medical workers, these have been slow to materialize and salaries to be fully paid. Local authorities across Libya face severe shortages of functioning hospitals, intensive care units, vital medical equipment, and supplies including personal protective equipment. According to a recent WHO survey, while 75 percent of primary health centres are open, only 20 per cent are delivering services.

Likewise, humanitarian actors face access constraints in moving humanitarian supplies into and around the country, and flights carrying medical supplies have not been able to land due to a lack of clearances in Benghazi. Negotiating clearances to operate during curfews due to COVID-19, as well as ongoing insecurity, have delayed relief distributions.

To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and in response to advocacy from UNSMIL, I welcome the reported release by Libyan authorities of more than 2,000 prisoners and detainees between 25 March and 15 May. The Supreme Judicial Council, the Public Prosecution, and the Ministry of Justice demonstrated desire to protect prisoners and detainees from COVID-19 and we encourage them to release further prisoners particularly women and children, persons with disabilities, persons with medical conditions, older persons, migrants and refugees. With technical support and equipment provided by the United Nations, al-Jadideh Prison in Tripoli hosted several successful remote court-hearings between 15 and 30 April.

We remain very concerned about the situation of migrants and asylum seekers in Libya. Since January, more than 3,200 have been intercepted at sea and returned to Libya frequently to abusive conditions in detention, whilst others have disappeared altogether. UNSMIL is also concerned about the expulsions of at least 1,400 migrants and refugees this year from eastern Libya in violation of Libya's international human rights law obligations on non-refoulement and collective expulsions, and the risk that more may soon be forcibly deported. We have received reports of the failure to assist and coordinated pushbacks of migrant boats in the central Mediterranean, which continues to be one of the deadliest migration routes in the world. Both Italy and Malta (and now Libya as well) have closed their ports to disembarkation of migrants rescued at sea, citing health concerns related to COVID-19. The stabilization of populations in Libya will only come, first and foremost, through an immediate ceasefire followed by a full return to political dialogue.

I would like to urge Member States to respond to our call for COVID-dedicated funding as well as to ramp up support to the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan, which is seriously underfunded at 14 per cent. The lack of funding is hampering our ability to combat the pandemic as well as to ensure that existing vulnerabilities are not exacerbated.

There is a risk that violence may expand in southern Libya as the conflict sharpens existing divisions. In the southern city of Sabha, the recently sworn-in elected municipal council was suspended after it made a statement supportive of the LNA on 26 April leading the GNA Ministry of Local Governance to replace it with an appointed Steering Committee. The elected council has filed an appeal of the GNA's decision. I encourage the Government to engage in a constructive dialogue with the elected council in order to safeguard democratic processes in Libya. Municipal service delivery should be shielded from national politics.

We commend the perseverance of Libya's local electoral committee officials who continue preparations to resume municipal council elections despite tremendous challenges. Another 38 local elections are planned to be held in 2020; municipal councils and the CCMCE are considering special measures to provide a safe environment for voting during the pandemic. Elections are planned in several municipalities in June and July, including in Misrata.

The fighting, compounded with COVID-19 and the on-going oil blockade, pose an unprecedented challenge to the already fraught socio-economic situation in Libya. The blockade itself has already cost Libya over USD four billion. With a looming budget deficit of 26 billion dinars in 2020, the Central Bank of Libya has imposed austerity measures including limits on foreign exchange. All of this has led to a loss of income, food shortages and price spikes, including supply chain disruptions. The parallel market exchange rate has increased from 4.1 LYD to the US dollar in January to 6.1 today, which further impacts people's purchasing power. Many of the gains from the economic reforms enacted in 2018 have been erased.

I have engaged both the Prime Minister and the Central Bank Governor to address the country's financial crisis and encourage dialogue with the aim of implementing a series of reforms which will mitigate both the national deficit and improve the lives of the average Libyan. This month the Ministry of Justice delivered an encouraging ruling on the legality of the international audit.

Another worrying trend is the weaponization of vital services. Since the end of March there have been four incidents, two that cut water supplies from the Man-Made River and two that have cut natural gas supplies to electrical power plants. These acts are reprehensible at any time but particularly at a time when the country is suffering from the effects of war and a global pandemic.

In a positive development, on 3 May the National Oil Corporation (NOC) managed to restore the institutional integrity of the national fuel distribution company, Brega, by reunifying the Management Committee. We welcome this development as it maintains the impartiality and effectiveness of the NOC.

I assure you that the United Nations will not relent in our effort to get Libya's political and military leaders to assume their responsibilities and commit to a ceasefire and a political settlement. In the wake of recent military developments, it appears there may be a window for the rejuvenation of some political activity.

On 23 April, House of Representatives President Saleh announced a new political initiative, calling for the social and political constituencies representing the East, the West and the South to elect their own representatives to a three-member Presidency Council under the supervision of the UN. By contrast, on the same day, General Haftar regrettably reiterated that he considers the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) and the current Presidency Council void and requested that Libyans choose an institution to lead the country for a transitional period. In a follow-up speech just four days later on 27 April, General Haftar ""accepted"" what he believes is a popular mandate for his General Command to play a greater governance role. On a more positive note, on 5 May, Prime Minister Serraj publicly welcomed all political initiatives that called for a peaceful solution to the Libyan crisis and urged all parties to resume political talks either within the framework of the LPA or via an agreement to hold elections under an agreed constitutional framework. Should the talks be held within the LPA framework, Mr. Serraj referred to the restructuring of the executive, including formation of a Presidency Council (PC) with three members, and a government headed by a prime minister.

We welcome the constructive stance taken by the Prime Minister and the HoR President and any political initiatives that are inclusive and aimed at ending the fighting and finding a peaceful solution to the conflict within the framework of the conclusions of the 19 January International Conference in Berlin and UNSCR 2510. Our mission remains to help Libyans rebuild a state strong enough to peacefully contain political differences.

We have engaged with the GNA and the LNA to build on the draft ceasefire agreement tabled at the 23 February 5+5 Joint Military Commission talks in Geneva. The Mission is analyzing comments on the draft agreement provided by the GNA team. We are still waiting to receive feedback from the LNA. I request your assistance to ensure that we receive a response at the earliest to resume these much-needed exchanges. The existing draft constitutes the most solid basis for a resumption of the discussion.

We appreciate the support expressed by participants to the Berlin Conference. In the same spirit, we hope to count on their backing to urgently stop the inflow of military support from abroad in violation of the UN arms embargo. The European Union launched a new Operation Irini on 1 April. We welcome all efforts to support the implementation of the UN arms embargo, in line with Security Council resolution 2292 (2016) and encourage Member States to contribute to its monitoring and implementation in a comprehensive manner.

We equally appreciate the interest of Member States and our Libya Quartet partner organizations to engage within the International Follow-Up Committee on Libya, which convened at the senior officials' level on 2 April and 13 May. The raison d'être of the Committee is to ensure implementation of the Berlin commitments. Discussions have begun in the four thematic working groups established under the Committee. The groups form a critical tool to support UNSMIL, but also to demonstrate to the Libyans that the Berlin Conference can deliver on its promises.

As we survey the carnage wrought by almost 15 months of unrelenting violence in Libya, I believe we have a reached another turning point in the conflict. From what we are witnessing in terms of the massive influx of weaponry, equipment and mercenaries to the two sides, the only conclusion that we can draw is that this war will intensify, broaden and deepen with devastating consequences for the Libyan people. As the foreign intervention increases, the Libyans themselves are getting lost in the mix, their voices crowded out. We must not let Libya slip away. We must enable responsible Libyans to write their own future. By coming together now, this Council can ensure the collective security it is mandated to maintain by applying consistent and credible pressure on those regional and international actors that are fueling the conflict. We can collectively write a different ending to this so far sad tale but only if we demonstrate a collective will to do so.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Tarhuna', 'Turkey', 'Italy', 'Bani Walid', 'Benghazi', 'Estonia', 'Brega', 'Misrata', 'Malta', 'Berlin', 'Geneva']","Williams to UNSC: Foreign interference, increased military build-up and mercenary arrivals continue on both sides",https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/05/20/williams-to-unsc-foreign-interference-increased-military-build-up-and-mercenary-arrivals-continue-on-both-sides/,None,
11397882,2020-05-18,"The internationally recognized Libyan government based in Tripoli today hailed the victory of its forces today in capturing the Witya airbase in north western Libya near the Tunisian border. The base had been under pro-Hafter forces since 2014. It is a huge moral victory for Tripoli and a morale-depleting defeat for Hafter's forces.

The forces defending Tripoli have been attempting to capture the airbase from the Khalifa Hafter forces for weeks now following their takeover of the western towns and cities in April.

Tripoli said the victory was bridge to a civilian and democratic state. It said the victory was not the end of the battle but brought it closer to a big victory day when all libyan cities and territories of lare totalitarian free. The implication being that it will go on to attempt to free places like Tarhuna and eastern Libya from Hafter's control.

It also said that it will document the artillery captured at the base to record violations by the states supporting Hafter and present them to the UN.

Hafter's forces meanwhile claimed that their troops had made a tactical withdrawal. Conflicting reports say they had escaped and are hiding near Zintan - whilst others say a deal was made to allow them to leave in return for a huge moral victory for the forces defending Tripoli.

The Tripoli defending forces claimed that they had captured a huge hoard of arms and vehicles on the base. Social media videos have been exhibiting arms and vehicles purportedly captured there. There are also unconfirmed reports of the destruction of Hafter's Pantsir anti-aircraft systems.

However, Hafter's Spokesperson, Ahmed Mesmari refuted this. Speaking to Arab media outlets he claimed no armament or vehicles were captured. He insisted the Libyan National Army (LNA) had made a tactical withdrawal with all its arms and vehicles. He also claimed that the base was not a strategic gain but a moral one for the forces defending Tripoli.

The loss of the airbase will be a blow to Hafter's LNA. It comes on the back of the loss of Gharian in June last year and Sabratha, Surman and the western coastal region in April this year. It sets a trend and gives the impression that Hafter is losing momentum and on the retreat - and especially since Turkey's intervention on the side of Tripoli and imposition of air dominance. It also raises questions of whether his allies are reducing their support for him. Time will tell.

Analysts say Turkey could keep the airbase as a permanent base for a strong foothold in the region.

11397883,2020-05-15,"Millions of schoolchildren worldwide are learning at home these days, and educators are striving to ensure that learning continues. Like in most of the countries in the Arab world, in Libya, the Government shuttered schools to combat COVID-19, while teachers, parents, and pupils are scrambling not to lose the rest of the school year.

Very few schools in the Arab world were doing something related to online education pre-COVID-19, but in Libya, since 2018, Aziza Al-Hassi, Tufaha Suhaim and Amine Kachroud were already undertaking first steps in this field.

That year, with the support of the European Union, the United Development Programme (UNDP) and Tatweer Research launched Tatweer Entrepreneurship Development Center (TEC) with the aim of building an ecosystem for entrepreneurship in Libya. In TEC, entrepreneurs can join various programs including business incubators, joint workspaces, Business and Technology trainings, and access to startup funding across all regions of Libya.

In 2018, during one of the TEC activities, Aziza, Tufahah and Amine met, shared their ideas and interests in the field of education, and eventually created their startup, ""School Connect,"" which aimed at connecting teachers and parents to follow up on the children's education.

With funds from the European Union, UNDP and Tatweer Research awarded the team with a grant with the goal of empowering women in conflict-affected countries to create sustainable businesses. With this support, the App ""School Connect"" became ""Panda"" and nowadays counts nearly 10 thousand students and parents of 30 schools registered.

Solving Problems and Striving Forward

""We were attracted to the idea of building a small company that could create job opportunities in this harsh environment and spreading a positive impact in society,"" says Aziza Al-Hassi, Panda co-founder.

""We wanted to solve the challenges that students, parents and teachers were facing with the educational process in Libya and we realized that communication between the interested parties was key to solve these issues,"" says Tufaha Suhaim, Panda co-founder.

""In many cases, information regarding a student's behavioural and academic performance fails to reach their parents. Our platform facilitates the transfer of this information from the school to the parent,"" explains Tufaha. ""Our service also solves multiple problems from the school's side, by summarizing much of the repetitive work school employees go through, in addition to helping the school forgo typical office expenses such as paper consumption, printing, and others,"" she adds.

Aziza emphasizes that the shared vision and goals of Panda's founders were the main impetus towards its establishment in the Libyan market. ""This was a very new business concept and we were not totally sure that the school administrations and parents would endorse this method, we were concerned that they might resist Panda's advanced technological solutions,"" she adds.

Mr. Mustafa Belhassan, Head of one school in Libya, was however one of the first supporters of Panda. After several meetings with the team he decided to start officially integrating Panda at his school. He confesses: ""I was impressed by the idea from the beginning and was surprised to find young people at their prime possessing such capabilities with practical technical solutions to the problems of education.""

""Mr. Mustafa is a passionate person who loves developing technologies,"" express Aziza Al-Hassi. ""Despite the complicated surrounding circumstances, he runs an excellent and very well-organized institution, but he was suffering from the difficulty of transferring information effectively,"" she explains. ""Traditional methods simply could not keep-up with the amount of information that had to be sent, which meant parents lacked the whole picture of their children's progress,"" concludes Aziza.

Entering the World of Entrepreneurship: Great Challenges Ahead

The idea of an electronic application is new to the educational system in Libya. Hence, Panda's members decided to launch awareness campaigns on the importance of communication between parents of students and schools, and the tremendous role that technology can play. Their efforts however met great challenges.

""People in Libya are very much unaccustomed to using online platforms, other than typical social media such as Facebook and Instagram. They held an implicit fear of any new application or system and tended to jump to the conclusion that new systems are complicated"" explains Amine Kashroud, Panda co-founder. ""From this standpoint, we started holding sessions and seminars in our schools to introduce parents to the benefits of our service"" he states.

COVID-19 and Sustainability

As the COVID-19 epidemic spread globally, in Libya, several educational institutions resumed teaching their curricula through electronic platforms, websites and social networks, the Panda team had to work intensively to adapt to the situation.

""We had to take a new step to automate our service so it can become suitable for transferring the academic content"", explains Aziza. ""We started organizing the process of sending educational content to the schools we work with, in order to reach students at home"", she continues. ""We also opened the door for any student, they can download the content even when the school is not registered with Panda.""

Two Years Since Launch: Reflecting on the Most Memorable Moments

The Panda team has expanded considerably creating job opportunities for young women and men. They have organised 40 workshops and providing 65 training sessions to schools on how to use the application.

""It feels like a dream when I remember the beginnings of our work on the application,"" says Tufaha Suhaim.

""Our start was tiring,"" says Aziza, ""It was marked by hard work to get to where we are today,"" she adds. They are committed to maintain their goal of reaching 60 schools this year.

""We do not stop here,"" says Amine, ""we have created a mini curriculum that focuses on technology and we are giving it to all schools involved with Panda. Each school puts forward a team to participate in our trainings and compete against each other"".

This is not the end but just the beginning

The founders of the Panda continue working to provide students with a greater number of lessons to avoid the interruption of their learning process. ""Our company hopes, in the long run, to become a standard for educational technology in the country and the region,"" says Tufaha.

""My advice to anyone who wants to start creating her own business is to make sure to create the best team and get the best support. The work chemistry amongst the team members is essential to succeed,"" says Aziza.

Since its launch, TEC has inspired many young men and women across the country to start establishing their own business projects, adopting innovative technologies and keeping pace with global developments in all sectors, with the overall objective of raising the efficiency and ability of the private sector in Libya.

""The role of the TEC Incubator team in providing support and guidance was crucial for Panda to adjust to the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 in the field of education, and we continue counting on its support to achieve all our business goals,"" concludes Amine.",Libya Herald,energy,,['Libya'],Young Libya entrepreneurs' online educational App thrives during COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/05/15/young-libya-entrepreneurs-online-educational-app-thrives-during-covid-19-pandemic/,None,
11397884,2020-05-11,"Turkey's Foreign Ministry yesterday warned that Hafter's elements could be considered legitimate targets if they target Turkish diplomatic missions and interests in Libya.

The statement comes after missiles, attributed widely both locally and internationally to Hafter's forces, landed near both the Italian and Turkish embassies in Tripoli on the night of 7 May.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry statement referred to Hafter as the ''warlord'' and ''putschist'', and his forces as ''illegitimate''. It described his actions as ''war crimes'', ''atrocities'' and ''massacres''. It said countries supporting Hafter share responsibility for the ''atrocity, chaos and instability'' Libya has drifted into.

It concluded by saying that Turkey will continue to support the legitimate Libyan government (in Tripoli).

Putting the Turkish statement into context, it must be recalled that the internationally recognized Libyan government in Tripoli had made a request for military help from the Turkish government in February this year.

It had signed two separate and controversial Memorandums of Understanding with Turkey on 27 November. The first was on military cooperation and the second was on the maritime boundaries of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean. The latter, controversially, allowed Turkey the right to drill for oil and gas in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Following the military cooperation deal, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that Turkey would consider sending troops to Libya if the Serraj government made such a demand. The Turkish Parliament approved a bill on 2 January.

The troops would aid the Tripoli government fighting against the forces led by Khalifa Hafter. In theory, the Turkish parliamentary approval allows for the deployment of non-combatant troops to act as advisers and trainers.

At the time, the Whitehouse had reported that U.S. President Trump warned Erdogan in a phone call against ''foreign interference'' in Libya.

It will be recalled that Khalifa Hafter's forces launched an attack on Tripoli on 4 April 2019 on the pretext of freeing it from ''terrorists, Islamists and militias''.

But it must also be recalled that Hafter receives or had received financial, political and military support from several countries, including, UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and France.

Another point to bear in mind is that Hafter was officially appointed as commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) by the still (and only) internationally recognized Libyan parliament based in eastern Libya, the House of Representatives (HoR).

On 4 January this year, the HoR reacted to Turkish parliamentary approval of the Turkish-Libyan MoU by cutting relations with Turkey, annulled the Libya -Turkish security and military agreement, withdrawing recognition of the (2015 Skhirat) Libyan Political Agreement and its resultant and internationally recognized Tripoli-based government (GNA) led by Faiez Serraj. It further called on the international community to likewise withdraw their recognition of the GNA.

It further referred Faiez Serraj, his Foreign Minister, Mohamed Siala, his Interior Minister, Fathi Bashagha and ''all those who contributed to bringing colonialism to our country'' to justice on charges of high treason.

It voted to authorize Khalifa Hafter's LNA to ''disrupt airports, ports and land ports under the control of (Tripoli) militias''

The HoR session did involve about 50 members, which is thought not to constitute a quorum.

On a related note, in its recent briefing, the US State Department said that both Hafter and the Tripoli government are using Syria/Turkish mercenaries. The Turkish mercenaries are Syrians of Turkish ethnicity.

Here is the statement if full Turkish Foreign Ministry statement:

The illegitimate militia forces led by warlord Haftar in Libya have recently increased their indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, particularly in Tripoli. Just on 9 May 2020, the elements affiliated with Haftar launched more than 100 missiles along with heavy artillery fire on civilian neighbourhoods in the city centre of Tripoli.

These attacks targeting diplomatic missions including our Embassy in Tripoli, Mitiga International Airport, civilian aircrafts prepared for departure and other civilian infrastructure, which resulted in civilian casualties and injuries, constitute war crimes. In this context, we reemphasize that we will consider Haftar's elements as legitimate targets in case they target our diplomatic missions and interests in Libya.

It is unacceptable for the United Nations to still remain inactive in the face of this atrocity. The international community bears a collective responsibility to stop putschist Haftar, who massacres his own people irrespective of child, woman or the elderly in this holy month of Ramadan and pandemic period.

It should not be forgotten that those countries providing military, financial and political support to Haftar share responsibility for the atrocity suffered by the Libyan people, and the chaos and instability the country is drifted into.

Turkey will continue to support the legitimate government and institutions of Libya for the protection of the friendly and brotherly Libyan people.

11397885,2020-05-04,"US Ambassador ,Richard Norland, and Libya's House of Representatives (HoR) head, Ageela Saleh, spoke last Thursday (1 May) and agreed on the ''importance of respect for democratic processes and the need to avoid individual attempts to unilaterally dictate Libya's political future using armed force'', the US Embassy Tripoli reported.

The talks come on the back of Ageela Saleh's new 8-point political initiative launched on 23 April to reform the current Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) as a way out of Libya's current political impasse.

Hafter, meanwhile, had announced on the same day a unilateral revocation of the internationally recognized LPA - in what was widely described as a coup d'état - and seemed to appoint himself as sole ruler of eastern Libya. His announcement was roundly rejected by the UN and leading international powers - including the US.

On 29 April Hafter went on to announce a unilateral declaration of a humanitarian truce in the fighting over Tripoli. However, the next day, Libya's internationally recognized government, based in Tripoli and led by Faiez Serraj, rejected Hafter's truce. Having violated previous other announced truces, Tripoli called the offered truce another empty promise. It called for international guarantees and monitoring as a precondition for the truce. It also described Hafter as ""bloodthirsty and power obsessed"".

The latest moves by Hafter must be seen in light of Hafter's forces being forced onto the backfoot in the fighting, having recently lost a string of north western coastal cities and towns, being pinned down at Wittya airbase and are on being the defensive on the Tarhuna front.

In its statement, the US Embassy reported that Norland and Saleh had ''agreed that there is no military solution in Libya, on rejecting an approach of imposing facts on the ground, and on the importance of continuing UNSMIL-facilitated negotiations. Mr. Saleh congratulated Ambassador Norland on the confidence placed in him by the United States, and noted the importance of shared and constructive engagement between Libya and Washington.

Ambassador Norland and Mr. Saleh discussed the Berlin Conference and the need for all participants to live up to their commitments not to interfere militarily in Libya. Mr. Saleh noted in his initiative that the time has come to end infighting among Libyans. Ambassador Norland highlighted the importance of counter-terrorism and the risk that continued conflict will open space for terrorist elements to regroup across the country.

Regarding the LNA's call for a Ramadan ceasefire, Ambassador Norland expressed the hope that building on that statement, the parties could take serious steps for the future of Libyans and return to negotiations under UN auspices for a lasting ceasefire in the 5+5 format, as agreed in Geneva on February 23. Ambassador Norland said the United States encourages all voices genuinely committed to peace and stability in Libya to take part in shaping the country's political future, and congratulated Mr. Saleh on his involvement in this process and its continuation.

11397887,2020-04-28,"Khalifa Hafter, commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), last night unilaterally revoked the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA).

The LNA is the officially recognized army of Libya's internationally recognized parliament, the House of Representatives (HoR) based in eastern Libya. Hafter said the LPA had destroyed the country and in an earlier speech he had said that the internationally recognized Faiez Serraj government in Tripoli was corrupt and treasonous.

In the televised speech aired last night, Hafter said that he was responding to calls by the Libyan people to mandate him to lead the country. The calls, in the form of a few token demonstrations, came in response to his own request last Thursday (23 April) that the Libyan people mandate him to lead Libya out of its current political impasse - over and beyond the current political process. The move has been labelled as a coup.

The announcement by Hafter puts him in direct conflict with his one-time ally HoR head Ageela Saleh who had launched his own political initiative also last Thursday. However, Ageela's initiative aimed to work within the LPA framework and sought to reform it by choosing a new executive (Presidency Council/Government of National Accord).

It must be recalled that Hafter was appointed to command the LNA by Ageela Saleh - in his role as head of the HoR. A coup against the LPA is a coup against the HoR which recognizes the LPA and the civilian democratic process. Hafter's unilateral abrogation of the LPA puts him in conflict with the HoR - if not overthrows its authority and legitimacy. It is unclear how the two can coexist and what Ageela Saleh and the HoR's response will be.

Hafter's critics have accused Hafter of finally coming out of the woods and showing his true colours as a dictator. They have pointed out that becoming a military dictator and returning Libya to military rule had been his aim all along and that he had used the HoR and civilian process simply as a veil to hide his political aims.

It will be recalled that the UN-brokered LPA signed in Skhirat, Morocco in December 2015 was the compromise and consensual agreement reached between the two opposed Libyan camps after the Tripoli militia coup by ""Libya Dawn"" in 2014 which overthrew the existing democratic order in western Libya. It set up an alternative Government of National Salvation as the democratically elected HoR and its caretaker government were forced to settle in the east. Libya's split continued from thereon.

The LPA created the current Presidency Council and its Government of National Accord (the executive) as well as the advisory body, the High State Council, which accommodates the rump of the outgoing parliament, the General National Council (GNC).

The LPA stipulated that all three bodies were to work together and agree consensually on major issues such as drafting the constitution, elections, approving the government (GNA) and security reform. This included heads of sovereign institutions and any reform to existing bodies. Even the HoR, the democratically elected body as a result of the 2014 elections - cannot reform the LPA unilaterally.

It is the lack of security and specifically militia reform that has been used - rightly or wrongly - as the one of the main excuses for the rejection of the GNA and the LPA. The LPA clearly stipulates for the reform of Libya's militias. While the HoR recognizes the LPA, it has refused to recognize its government. The Tripoli government failed miserably to reform the militias - indeed rather than enlisting and absorbing them into its police, army and state intelligence apparatus (institutions), experts agree that it is the militias that have succeeded in absorbing Tripoli's state institutions by leading or controlling them.

Hence, rather than the Tripoli government controlling the militias - it depends on the militias for its survival and operation.

Another axe to grind with Tripoli by the HoR is the Tripoli Central Bank of Libya (CBL). Libya's east accuse it of being corrupt and of opening Letters of Credit to militias. It has sacked the incumbent Tripoli CBL Governor two times, but he has refused to budge.

Hence, despite what the LPA stipulates on paper and in text, the east found themselves powerless and marginalized to affect Libya's politics through the LPA process. Tripoli is in control of the inherited institutions such as the CBL and NOC, and in control of the oil money which as a result of historic contracts flows into Tripoli. The east found themselves unable to reduce the power of western Libya's militias and power/money balance which led them increasingly to use methods outside the LPA and civilian political dialogue.

None of this justifies Hafter's year-long military onslaught on Tripoli and the deaths, injury and damage to civilians and infrastructure - but once the east set off on an escalatory path, they found themselves with no option but a military attempt to shift the balance.

Critics see this move as a last-ditch desperate act by Hafter in view of his recent military losses in western Libya.

11397888,2020-03-10,"The Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Court (ICC) yesterday unanimously confirmed the admissibility of the case against Saif Al-Islam Qaddafi before the Court and rejected his appeal against the Pre-Trial Chamber I's decision dismissing his challenge to the admissibility of this case.

The Appeals Chamber said that the Court is ""complementary to national criminal jurisdictions"". It added that a case is inadmissible when a person ""has already been tried"" and no person ""who has been tried by another court"" for crimes under the ICC jurisdiction shall be tried by the ICC with respect to the same conduct. In reviewing the Pre-Trial Chamber's decision, the ICC said that the Appeals Chamber found no error in it and agreed with its interpretation of the Rome Statute, indicating that the decision issued by a national jurisdiction must be final before a case can be declared inadmissible.

The ICC said that having considered the submissions of the Defence, the Prosecutor, the victims, Libya's government and others, the Appeals Chamber found that the Pre-Trial Chamber did not err in concluding that the Libyan judgment of 28 July 2015 against Saif Qaddafi was rendered in absentia. It added that this is also supported by the Libyan Government's submissions to the ICC. Thus, under Libyan Law, the Tripoli Court's judgment cannot be considered final. The Appeals Chamber further agreed with Pre-Trial Chamber I's decision that the Libyan Law No. 6 (2015) in respect of amnesty is not applicable to the crimes for which Saif Qaddafi was convicted by the Tripoli Court. Accordingly, the Appeals Chamber rejects Mr Qaddafi's appeal, the ICC explained.

It will be recalled that the situation in Libya was referred to the ICC Prosecutor by the United Nations Security Council in its Resolution 1970. On 3 March 2011, the Prosecutor announced the opening of an investigation in the situation in Libya, which was assigned by the Presidency to Pre-Trial Chamber I.

On 27 June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber I issued three warrants of arrest respectively for Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi, Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi for crimes against humanity (murder and persecution) allegedly committed across Libya from 15 until at least 28 February 2011, through the State apparatus and Security Forces. On 22 November 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber I formally terminated the case against Muammar Gaddafi due to his death. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi are not in the custody of the Court.

On 31 May 2013, Pre-Trial Chamber I rejected Libya's challenge to the admissibility of the case against Saif Al Islam Gaddafi and reminded Libya of its obligation to surrender the suspect to the Court. On 21 May 2014, the Appeals Chamber upheld Pre-Trial Chamber I's decision.

On 11 October 2013, Pre-Trial Chamber I decided that the case against Abdullah Al-Senussi is inadmissible before the ICC as it was currently subject to domestic proceedings conducted by the Libyan competent authorities and that Libya is willing and able genuinely to carry out such investigation. On 24 July 2014, the Appeals Chamber confirmed Pre-Trial Chamber I's decision.

11397889,2020-01-27,"A UN report published today urges accountability for the 53 Tajura Detention Centre migrant deaths caused by an airstrike in July 2019. The airstrike was attributed by Tripoli at the time to pro Khalifa Hafter forces. The UN report attributes the strike to ''a foreign state'' supporting Hafter. It names no state. In Tripoli this is taken to be the UAE.

The report said that it was one of the deadliest incidents since a new round of hostilities broke out in April 2019. The UN report renewed its call on all parties to the conflict to conduct independent, impartial and thorough investigations to ensure accountability for violations of international law.

The 13-page report, published by the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and the UN Human Rights Office, also calls for urgent action to prevent a similar tragedy from happening in a conflict in which at least 287 civilians were killed and some 369 civilians injured in 2019, with 60 percent of these casualties attributed to airstrikes.

The report is based on visits by UNSMIL personnel to the site, analysis of video footage and other evidence, as well as subsequent interviews with survivors and witnesses. It finds that on 2 July an air-delivered bomb struck a vehicle repair workshop operated by the Daman Brigade, an armed group allied with Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA).

A second airstrike 11 minutes later hit the Tajoura Detention Centre, a large hangar located in the same complex where 616 migrants and refugees were being held. The second section of the hangar, where 126 people were detained took a direct hit, killing at least 47 men and six boys.

The report concurs with previous UN findings that the airstrikes were likely conducted by aircraft belonging to a foreign state, noting that, ''it remains unclear whether these air assets were under the command of the LNA (Libyan National Army) or were operated under the command of that foreign state in support of the LNA.""

""The July 2019 attack at Tajoura is a tragic example of how the use of air power has become a dominant feature in Libya's civil conflict, and of the dangers and direct consequences on civilians of foreign interference,"" said Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNSMIL Ghassan Salamé. ""This is why the commitments made in Berlin on 19 January to end such interference and uphold the UN arms embargo must take hold.""

All parties to the conflict knew the precise location and coordinates of the Tajoura Detention Centre, which was previously hit by an airstrike in May 2019, the report added.

The report calls on all parties, particularly the GNA and the LNA, as well as any States supporting either party, to conduct investigations into the airstrikes with a view to ensuring the swift prosecution of those responsible.

""As I have said previously, the Tajoura attack, depending on the precise circumstances, may amount to a war crime. Libyans, migrants and refugees are trapped amid violence and atrocities that are in turn fuelled by impunity. Those guilty of crimes under international law must be held to account,"" said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.

In addition, despite the detention centre having already been hit, the Daman Brigade failed to move detainees from the vicinity of a potential military objective or move military objects that were positioned next to the detention centre. This likely amounts to a violation by the Daman Brigade and the GNA of their obligation to take all feasible measures to protect civilians under their control from the effects of attacks, the report says, the report said.

However, the report stressed that this failure ""in no way absolves"" the party responsible for the airstrike from its own obligations under international humanitarian law to abide by the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack.

The report also urges the responsible Libyan authorities to close all migration detention centres and ensure that released migrants and refugees receive prompt protection and assistance

As of the end of December 2019, some 3,186 people were being held in migration detention centres without due process and in conditions falling below international minimum standards. Currently, an estimated 2,000 migrants are exposed to or are in close proximity to the fighting in and around Tripoli, the report revealed.

The report said that the UN has repeatedly called for the closure of all migrant detention centres in Libya, where UN human rights staff have documented severe overcrowding, torture, ill-treatment, forced labour, rape, and acute malnutrition, among other serious human rights violations. Urgent priority should be given to closing centres in or next to compounds controlled by parties to the conflict.

Following the airstrikes in July, all migrants and refugees were released from the Tajoura Detention Centre. On 1 August 2019, the GNA announced its intention to close three detention centres, including Tajoura. However, according to the latest information we have received, the Tajoura Detention Centre remains open, the UN report added.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tajura', 'Tripoli', 'Libya', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Berlin']",UN report urges accountability for Tajura's 53 migrant airstrike deaths,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/01/27/un-report-urges-accountability-for-tajuras-53-migrant-airstrike-deaths/,None,
11397890,2020-01-26,"The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said in a statement released yesterday that it deeply regrets the continued ''blatant violations of the arms embargo'' in Libya, ''even after the commitments made in this regard by concerned countries during the International Conference on Libya in Berlin'' held on 19 January 2020.

It said that the 12 January truce agreed by the internationally recognized Libyan government based in Tripoli and the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA), which had led to ''remarked reduction of hostilities in Tripoli'', has provided a much-needed respite for civilians in the capital.

However, it warned that this fragile truce is now threatened by the ''ongoing transfer of foreign fighters, weapons, ammunition and advanced systems to the parties by member states, including several who participated in the Berlin Conference''.

UNSMIL reported that ''over the last ten days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armoured vehicles, advisers and fighters''. The mission condemns these ongoing violations, which risk plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting.

It called on the concerned countries to live up to their commitments, and unequivocally and fully respect and implement the arms embargo in Libya established by the UN Security Council Resolution 1970 (2011) and subsequent Resolutions.

The UNSMIL statement comes on the back of a Ministerial meeting in Algiers from Libya's neighbouring countries a week after the much-heralded Berlin conference on Libya.

Last Thursday the internationally recognized Libyan government led by Faiez Serraj called on the international community to shoulder its responsibility in protecting Mitiga airport.

The call came after missiles were targeted towards the airport on Wednesday leading to its closure. The call by the Serraj administration also comes after Khalifa Hafter's spokesperson, Ahmed Mesmari, announced that Tripoli and Mitiga airport were a ''no-fly zone''. He threatened any military or civilian aircraft flying over Tripoli with destruction.

The catalyst for this was ostensibly a drone that the Khalifa Hafter forces claim they had shot down after it had taken off from Mitiga. The forces defending Tripoli claimed that it was they who had shot the drone down which they claim belonged to the Hafter forces.

All these developments come in the shadow of the much-heralded Berlin conference on Libya meant to cement the temporary truce into a more permanent ceasefire. The conference's final communique and United Nation's support portended decreased international involvement and arms supplies to Libya and a move to political dialogue.

Sadly, the immediate realities post the Berlin Libya conference means that Berlin is in danger of being no more effective in finding a peaceful solution to the Libyan crisis than the outcomes of the Abu Dhabi, Palermo or Paris conferences on Libya. All these conferences continue to reflect the disunited stance on Libya by the Security Council and the EU.

11397891,2020-01-21,"Libya's state National Oil Corporation (NOC) confirmed yesterday a virtual total oil production shutdown resulting in a loss of crude oil production of 1.2 million b/d and daily financial losses of approximately $77 million.

The closures came in the lead up to the Berlin conference on Libya held last Sunday and are attributed by the NOC to the pro Khalifa Hafter forces guarding the oilfields and ports.

Reporting in a public information notice on its latest production and loading status at its blockaded oil ports, the NOC confirmed that Hariga, Brega, Sidra and Ras Lanuf ports are closed and under force majeure.

This, it confirmed, was declared after instructions to halt exports were given on 17 January 2020 to NOC operating subsidiaries by Major General Nagi al-Moghrabi, the commander of Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG) appointed by the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA), and Colonel Ali al-Jilani from the LNA's Greater Sirte Operations Room.

It explained that these ports have limited storage capacity, and that the NOC will be forced to shut crude oil production when capacity is filled.

As a result of the declaration of force majeure on all loadings from Zueitina, Hariga, Brega, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports, following these instructions to halt exports, the NOC revealed that it is unable to load a scheduled cargo of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) destined for Benghazi.

It explained that Benghazi storage facility contains 12 days of LPG supply, and the that NOC is taking measures to ensure continuity of supply.

Benghazi port remains open, however, with the NORDIC PIA tanker, carrying diesel, being discharged there. The ATLANTIC SIRIUS tanker, arriving from the Zawia refinery, also arrived at the Benghazi port yesterday, the NOC added.

The NOC warned that the shutdown of associated gas production, used to supply power plants in Zueitina and North Benghazi, will result in power shortages that will lead to load shedding in the eastern region.

Similarly, the closure of valves in the Hamada pumping station on 19 January 2020 by the PFG resulted in the declaration of force majeure and shutdown of production from the Sharara and El Feel oilfields. This caused the suspension of supplies to the Ubari power plant (in southern Libya) and will eventually cause it to stop when it runs out of stock, the NOC explained.

Production from the Hamada oilfield was shut down on 20 January 2020.

The NOC explained to the Libyan public that force majeure is a contractual clause that frees it from its legal obligations to supply oil or gas to customers when faced with circumstances outside its control, including war, strikes and bad weather. Force majeure is generally lifted when the circumstances that led to it being imposed are removed. Force majeure cannot be selectively applied to customers, concluded the NOC public information notice.

11397892,2020-01-18,"Libya's state National Oil Corporation (NOC) today declared force majeure at five of its eastern oil ports of Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina and Sidra ports. It blamed the move on ''blockades on oil exports'' imposed by the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA).

The NOC said that the LNA General Command and the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) of the Central and Eastern Regions had instructed the managements of its Sirte Oil Company, Harouge Oil Operations, Waha Oil Company, Zueitina Oil Company and Arab Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) subsidiaries, to stop oil exports from Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina, and Sidra ports.

It added that the blockade instructions were given by Major General Nagi al-Moghrabi, the commander of PFG appointed by the LNA, and Colonel Ali al-Jilani from the LNA's Greater Sirte Operations Room.

The NOC stated that this blockade will result in a loss of 800,000 barels per day of crude oil production and financial losses of approximately US$ 55 million per day.

Meanwhile, in a statement released today, UNSMIL expresses deep concern over current efforts to disrupt or impair oil production in Libya. It said that this move would have devastating consequences first and foremost for the Libyan people who depend on the free flow of oil for their well-being. It added that it will also have terrible knock-on effects for the country's already deteriorated economic and financial situation.

UNSMIL urged all Libyans to exercise maximum restraint while international negotiations continue to broker an end to Libya's longstanding crisis, including recommending measures to ensure transparency in the allocation of resources. It reiterated the importance of preserving the integrity and neutrality of the National Oil Corporation.

Yesterday, the NOC had strongly condemned calls to blockade oil ports ahead of Sunday's Berlin conference on Libya by tribes in the eastern oil crescent.

NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla had said that the oilfields and ports were ''not cards to be played to solve political matters'' and that a shutdown was ''like setting fire to your own house.""

Sanalla's statement came on the back of Alumda Al-Sanussi al-Zwei, head of the Zwei tribe which inhabits large parts of Libya's eastern oil crescent region where about two-thirds of the country's hydrocarbons are produced, was quoted by Libya's eastern-based LANA state news agency as ''announcing the start of the movement to close oilfields and oil ports'' in order to ''dry up the sources of terrorist financing (by Tripoli) through oil revenues''.

The tribal leader told LANA that the movement ""closed the Sariri oilfield today and (as a result this) stopped work at Zweitina oil port"".

He had claimed out that ''all tribes in the region are involved in this movement until the demands are implemented''.

Monday's announced closures and Saturday's NOC-announced force majeure come ahead of Sunday's Berlin conference on Libya seeking a solution to the Libya crisis.

It follows on from last Sunday's ceasefire called for by Turkey and Russia which has been observed by the Hafter forces attacking Tripoli and the Tripoli forces aligned to the Faiez Serraj internationally recognized government in Tripoli that are defending the capital.

It will also be recalled that a peace deal put forward by Russia and Moscow last Monday was signed by Faiez Serraj but Hafter had left Moscow unexpectedly without signing the agreement.

Hafter's forces had launched an unprovoked attack on Tripoli on 4 April 2019.

Although there have been reports of some daily violations of the ceasefire heard on the outskirts of the capital since Sunday, residents report a general overall continuation of the ceasefire.

11398058,2020-05-09,"The US Department of State held a Special Briefing by video call on Russian Engagement in the Middle East Thursday which covered both Syria and Libya. The briefing said it aimed to shed some light on ''Russian malign engagement in the Middle East with a specific focus on Russian actions in Syria and in Libya.

It added that Russia has exploited instability in Libya to advance its own military, economic, and geopolitical interest there and throughout North Africa. The three State Department Speakers were:

Summarising the sections from the brief on Libya, the US State Department said that in Libya, the US has two goals: one, an immediate end to the conflict; and two, a return to political negotiations. The United States does not support LNA military action against Tripoli.

On Russian policy in the Libya, the State Department said Russia uses the combination of military power, proxies, and disinformation to shape outcomes, and specifically, is seeking an enhanced presence in Libya to expand its influence across the Mediterranean and also onto the African continent.

On Wagner, which is often referred to as a private military company by the media, the State Department said that Wagner is ''misleadingly'' referred to as a Russian private military company, but in fact it's an instrument of the Russian Government.

On the possibility that Russia might end its support for Hafter, the State Department said ''No one should think that Russia is going to pack up and leave now that they've invested in the Libyan conflict''.

On the other states backing Hafter (such as Egypt and the UAE), the brief said the ''US doesn't see Hafter's backers backing down soon, don't see them backing down''. On Syrian mercenaries, the brief said ''Syrian mercenaries are fighting with both sides''.

Here are the sections on Libya verbatim including introductions and media questions and answers:

ROBINSON: Libya has become the next venue for Russia's malign efforts to exploit regional conflicts for its own narrow political and economic gain. While Russia often publicly claims support for a political solution, such as in Syria or Libya, it simultaneously engages in activities that undermine a political peace process and widen the conflict.

In Libya, Russia continues its military support for the Libyan National Army of General Haftar. Russia has provided material and logistical support to the Wagner Group, a U.S.-sanctioned entity led by Putin crony Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is also sanctioned by the United States.

Russia's surge in support to the LNA has led to a significant escalation of the conflict and a worsening of the humanitarian situation in Libya. Wagner is often misleadingly referred to as a Russian private military company, but in fact it's an instrument of the Russian Government which the Kremlin uses as a low-cost and low-risk instrument to advance its goals. More recently, Russia in coordination with the Assad regime has ferried Syrian fighters to Libya to participate in Wagner operations in support of the LNA.

WOOSTER: In Libya we've got two goals: one, an immediate end to the conflict; and two, a return to political negotiations, or dialogue, if you will. So let me walk you through how we see malign influence out there.

Our starting point is that foreign intervention has exacerbated divisions, widened the conflict, transformed it into a proxy war, threatened regional stability, and as you can imagine, in combination all of these things impinge upon (inaudible) if they don't harm, in fact, U.S. interests - thus our interests.

So, the Kremlin uses this combination of military power, proxies, and disinformation to shape outcomes, and specifically, Moscow is seeking an enhanced presence in Libya to expand its influence across the Med and also onto the African continent.

And more specifically, Wagner support to Haftar's LNA or, if you will, the Libyan National Army has escalated the conflict. It's emboldened the LNA to continue its offensive which in turn is destabilizing, pushing the Government of National Accord - the internationally recognized government which the United States recognizes - it's pushed them to seek increased Turkish support to counter the Wagner-based LNA assault. So you see the escalatory effects here.

No one should think that Russia is going to pack up and leave now that they've invested in the Libyan conflict. So the way to end Russian and other foreign interference in Libya is to first end the Tripoli conflict - of course, that's the pretext - end that and revive political talks between the Libyans, and this done through UN-facilitated negotiations.

Lastly, on my end of it, a coordinated response from the international community pressing all the actors, Libyan and external, to deescalate is imperative. We, the United States, for our part will continue to press Russia, Turkey, the UAE, among others to encourage LNA and the GNA to return to these UN negotiations. We're looking for a lasting ceasefire that they (inaudible) sides had agreed to in Geneva in February.

Media question: I've been reading that there are Syrian mercenaries on both sides being brought in by the Russians and also the Turks. And if you could give us some detail about that.

WOOSTER: Yes, Syrian mercenaries are fighting with both sides in the conflict, so with the GNA and the LNA. And we have been clear with both the Libyans and both sides within the Libyan conflict as well as the foreign backers of both of those sides that we oppose the deployment of mercenaries.

So long story short, mercenaries of any stripe or type go into the bad column.

WOOSTER: on the question of Syrian mercenaries, there is a very troubling other element here, and that is the Libyan National Army's or Khalifa Haftar's establishment of so-called diplomatic relations with the Assad regime, which is very much a part of the piece of the question of Syrian mercenaries, at least on his side of the equation.

Media question: I just had two quickies. One: Could you just spell out what the policy is toward Haftar right now? We had the statement from the White House a year ago saying that the President recognizes Haftar's significant role in fighting terrorism. That seemed to contradict statements that Secretary Pompeo had made before. So, does the U.S. support Haftar or believe that he has a significant role to play? What is our stance toward him?

WOOSTER: I'll go quick on the answer about U.S. support for Haftar. No, the United States does not support LNA military action against Tripoli. So, for us, the attack on the capital diverts resources from what is a priority for us, which is the counterterrorism against specifically ISIS and AQIM. It also brings about a humanitarian crisis. Long story short, it's bad news. We don't support it, and we don't support him doing this.

Media question: I wanted to see if you had an estimate of the strength of the Wagner Group. There was the UN report that came out recently that was saying up to 1,200 fighters perhaps in Libya. Do you have a sense of the size and the significance of that? And related to that, there have been a series of reports or indications that perhaps the Russians have soured on Haftar, that they don't see him as really the best game in town and somebody who's going to do the job in terms of their interests. What's your read on that and what's the endgame for the Russians in terms of what they're looking for with supporting Haftar?

WOOSTER: Yeah, sure. In terms of the numbers, we had - Assistant Secretary David Schenker did testimony late 2019 on this, and I don't remember the math so I'm - hesitate to toss out a number saying to you, ""I think it was about this."" We used a number - I don't recollect what that number was off the top of my head. If it's important to you, we can get that for you. That number will have changed. It will have only gone upwards.

ROBINSON: Yeah, I mean, we've seen it fluctuate. I would note that they do possess very heavy and advanced weapons, and we've seen them in public media accounting, and social media that follow the conflicts have captured photos of really advanced equipment that private companies don't tend to have that really illustrates that this is the Russian Government operating the - Wagner.

And on the endgame, look, they may have - find working with General Haftar difficult, but when they say they're not wedded to one particular actor - but we saw that in Syria, and they got themselves pretty wedded to Assad. We see them say that about Haftar, but they seem to double down on him. Or in Venezuela, and they've doubled down on Maduro. They do tend to not back down, even when they've made a bad bet.

Media question: I have, very quick, two questions. Haftar has had some - several setbacks on the front line. Do you think there is any chance that his foreign backers would persuade him to end the Tripoli offensive?

And the other thing: You expressed discontent over Haftar establishing ties with Assad. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that? And specifically, have you seen Assad send Syrian fighters to help Haftar in his Tripoli offensive?

WOOSTER: On the matter of different backers, Haftar's foreign backers, no, we don't - look, for as long as there is an objective that they can meet through Haftar as an instrument, we don't see them backing down. Believe me, we are discussing these things with them all the time. We bring these concerns all the time to the backers on both sides, not just with Haftar, and the fingers keep pointing one side at the other. So, I don't think that in the near-term offing, at least in the foreseeable future, there is any likely prospect whatsoever that that will happen.

11398257,2020-04-24,"Libya's situation is ''bleak'' with ''a perfect storm'' of ''a proxy war'', a political split, economic collapse, and a pandemic, said Stephanie Williams Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) in a virtual press conference yesterday.

She said Libya's truce is ''in name only'' with arms ''pouring'' into the country which has become an ''experimental field'' for weapons with an ''alphabet soup'' of foreign mercenaries, with 400,000 internally displaced.

Williams said she was concerned about the prison break of criminals in western Libya and collective punishment exercised by both sides and ''very, very concerned'' about reports of the possible use of chemical weapons by the Khalifa Hafter side in the fighting.

On a positive note, she said that there are ongoing contacts in all the ''three track'' talks started by her former boss Ghassan Salame.

Here is a transcript of the press conference:

Alessandra Vellucci, Director of the United Nations Information Service in Geneva and moderator: Good morning everybody, thank you for being with us for this press conference on the latest development in Libya and the work of the UN in the current Libyan context. We have the great pleasure to have with us Stephanie Turco Williams, Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).

The Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) Stephanie Williams: Good morning everyone, I wish that we could meet in person, but as you know, circumstances are preventing that and I hope to see you all again very soon, as soon as we can get back to Geneva and resume the three Libyan tracks. I will provide a brief topper.

I am sorry to report that I have a very bleak assessment right now of the situation in Libya. What we have now is a perfect storm, an ongoing, in fact, escalating conflict that is directly being fuelled by external parties - it is really now much more of a burgeoning proxy war. We have divided institutions, dysfunction, corruption, a struggling economy, no oil revenues or very few oil revenues coming in. Since the blockade was imposed around mid-January, the country has lost $ 4 billion at least in oil revenues. And finally, last but not least, we have a pandemic, a corona pandemic which is stretching an already decimated health infrastructure, health system.

We have the UN, UNSMIL and the humanitarian agencies on the ground in Libya, delivering in these very difficult circumstances, delivering to the Libyan people and working with the local authorities across the country. WHO is working with the national centres for disease control. These are extraordinary circumstances, extraordinary times.

We are at the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan; the Secretary-General has sent out his Ramadan greetings and has reiterated his call for a ceasefire, for an end to the conflicts throughout the region. He obviously had a global ceasefire call in conjunction with the COVID pandemic, which was echoed by many Member States and regional organizations. Unfortunately, that call has thus far been ignored. We hope that with the beginning of Ramadan, the parties to the conflict and their external sponsors will pause and reconsider their decision to continue fighting in the midst of this devastating global pandemic, implications of which for Libya are immense.

With that, I am happy to provide an update on where we are with regard to the Berlin process, to the three tracks, to the international follow-up and associated working groups.

Media question: Good morning. Stefanie, if you just can elaborate on the situation now in the western coast of Libya, the fighting and so on.

Williams: The conflict continues. Last week, we have had the GNA offensive to take the six coastal cities, including Surman, Sabratha and Al-Ajilat. We saw an attempt to take the Woutia Air Base. We are, of course, monitoring that situation in western coastal cities very carefully.

Two comments: one is, there is relative calm on the ground now. We have concerning reports coming out of Surman and Sabratha about retributions, acts of revenge, burning of houses, and we also have, obviously, the reports on the prison break and the release of some potentially very alarming figures, people who have been involved in the human trafficking, fuels smuggling and other violent crimes. We have urged the authorities to take a handle on this issue.

All this being said about the western coastal cities, there is also intensified and some of the worst shelling that is taking place around Tripoli right now - in the southern suburbs of Tripoli, but it is also being felt, obviously, in downtown Tripoli. You have a situation now where the population is under 24-hour curfew because of the pandemic; you have families who had been displaced from their homes in southern Tripoli, now being displaced multiple times, moving further and further into the densely populated areas of Tripoli and now being affected by this horrible, intense shelling and the appearance on the battlefield of new weapons coming in from outside.

To the east of Tripoli, obviously there is an offensive going on, there is a siege on the city of Tarhuna. We are following that very carefully as well. We are concerned about reports of increased displacement of civilians from Tarhuna - up to 3,100 have been displaced - and we are also very concerned about the cuts of the electricity to the city at a time of a pandemic. We condemn the use of collective punishment in terms of cuts of electricity, water, gas; this is being used by both parties to the conflict.

Media question: Could you say to us who is doing the shelling in the downtown Tripoli? Is it the rebel forces or is it the recognized Government forces, could you elaborate on who is doing that? And could you also say that, if we did not have the COVID-19 crisis at the moment, would you be closer now to getting the three tracks going again than you were a month ago?

Stephanie Williams: It is primarily being conducted by the LNA forces, the forces that are attacking Tripoli. There has been an exchange of artillery, obviously, on all of these fronts. It is this increasing use of heavy artillery and new weapons that are being brought to the battlefield, that is directly affecting civilians. In all of this, it is the ordinary Libyans who are getting lost.

Media question: Irrespective of the COVID-19 crisis, do you think that you are closer to getting the three tracks going again than you would have been a month ago?

Williams: Obviously, the inability to have physical meetings in the three tracks has somewhat impacted our work. I would like to say that when the restrictions have lifted, when we are all healthy enough and when it is safe enough for us to travel, that we can immediately commence the three tracks. In fact, we had scheduled in mid-March a meeting of the economic track in Tunis - it would have been the third meeting of that track and we had to postpone it. But I am happy to say that in all three tracks, there is ongoing contact and I can elaborate on this.

On the economic track, we have three sub-committees that stemmed from the first two meetings, the first meeting in Tunis and the second meeting in Cairo. We have sub-committees amongst the participants themselves focusing on the banking sector; they have provided a lot of very useful input and recommendations to the Mission as we help the Libyans tackle what is now an increasingly bleak and complicated economic situation. We have a subcommittee, which is dealing with decentralization and management of the oil revenues and the distribution of those revenues; they have also developed and matured a lot of ideas which can be brought into the political track and the security track when they are right. Last but not least is a subcommittee that deals with reconstruction and development and they too are refining their recommendations to be fed into the wider process.

On the political track, many of the participants who attended the inaugural political track meeting in Geneva, where we last saw many of you, are in touch. Sadly, one of the participants, Dr. Mahmoud Jibril, passed away due to the COVID-19 in Cairo earlier in the month.

On the security track, we are maintaining constant contact with both delegations to the 5+5 military talks and I, in fact, have been in direct contact with both General Haftar and Prime Minister Al-Sarajj to urge them to substantively respond to the draft ceasefire paper which was tabled by UNSMIL at the close of the second round of those military talks.

Media question: We know very well that with the current situation, the public health situation, there are no reporters on the ground. Do you know if the ceasefire is respected and how? The second question is in relation to the great number of migrants and the refugees on the Libyan territory and the situation of the public health connected to them. Is there any support that is given to the migrants and the refugees stranded in Libya by the United Nations?

Williams: For the first part of the question on violations of the ceasefire. So, there have been two truces and ceasefires which both parties to the conflict have putatively signed up to. One of course was the January 12 truce that was called up by the Presidents of Russia and Turkey. Since January 12 and to this day, we have over 850 violations of that truce. We have a number of violations also of the truce that was subsequently agreed to by the parties in responding to the calls for a humanitarian truce for the COVID crisis. You know, there is a truce in name only. You cannot really call it a truce; you cannot call it a cease-fire.

We have had 70 violations just in the last week and as a result of the violations, we have had 49 civilian casualties recorded between the 14 and the 20 of April, including eight deaths. So, you cannot really speak credibly of a truce or a ceasefire that has been enacted on the ground.

Yes, so migrants and refugees are an incredibly vulnerable population, particularly during a time of conflict, and then when you have conflict conniving with Corona, they are particularly vulnerable and need to be reached. We do have our humanitarian agencies on the ground, of course, primarily UNHCR and IOM. You also you know that Libya remains the destination country, even during the state of war and the pandemic. Most of the migrants are economic migrants, but they are also frankly in need of international protection. We have 48,000 asylum seekers and refugees who are registered with UNHCR.

We can also talk about the displaced Libyans who are now overall about 400,000, who have been displaced since the conflict broke out over a year ago. We have asylum seekers who are detained in detention centres although those numbers have come down. In the 11 official detention centres, we had an overall number of about 5,000 in January 2019 and it is about 1,500 now. We, the UN, are advocating for rescues at sea to resume, rescues at sea to land in safe ports outside of Libya. We continue, of course, to advocate for closure of the detention centres. These are overcrowded locations in the best of time, and now with the pandemic, there is just a huge risk. We have been advocating and trying to work with the authorities in Libya to release migrants and refugees into urban settings, finding resettlement solutions, as well of course as solutions in countries of origin.

So that is all to say that this is very much on our radar. As I said, we are working under extraordinary conditions with all kinds of restrictions but we are still able to reach this very vulnerable population.

Media question: I have a question on the EU operations and enforcing the arms embargo. How do you see the operations, if there are any, and what is the UN doing to enforce the embargo on the arms. You spoke about new arms coming, could you be more specific about that. Thank you.

Williams: Of course, we welcome the new European Union operation. This all needs to be, of course, in keeping with Security Council Resolutions. As you know, the arms embargo violations are not happening only by sea, you have violations in terms of air supplies. Many flights have come in, and of course, weapons and mercenaries who are crossing land borders. So, it needs to be a comprehensive monitoring of violations to the UN arms embargo.

Look in terms of what we are doing, the panel of experts, of course, is extremely busy. I mean, while unfortunately many flights and planes around the world have stopped flying, we cannot say that about Libya because there are a number of cargo flights that are coming in to re-supply the LNA. We see cargo flights landing in Benina in Benghazi and other airports in eastern Libya, with a constant re-supply. On the other side we see cargo vessels pouring into Misrata and Tripoli with supplies of weapons. Just in terms of the new weapons that were seen on the ground, I mean Libya has become an experimental field for all kinds of new weapon systems. We have something called the RPOA flame-thrower, which is some kind of a thermobaric system that is being used in the southern suburbs of Tripoli. We have new UAV's that are being brought in, including a UAV that is essentially like a suicide UAV - it explodes on impact. These are just two examples of very frightening systems that are being deployed in an urban setting which is completely unacceptable.

We at the UN call on all of those who are violating the arms embargo, including countries who sat down at the table in Berlin, signed up to respect the arms embargo, but yet continue to blatantly violate it, and that must stop. Again, what gets lost here are and the impact is on the Libyan people themselves. Libya cannot be a theatre for proxy war which is what we are increasingly seeing happen.

Media question: I have two more questions, actually. As I understand, you are in Tripoli. I would like to ask if you are still observing the arrival of foreign fighters to Tripoli from Syria and elsewhere. This is my first question. My second is how much is the UN Mission in Libya concerned about the release of the prisoners from the cities taken by the Tripoli authorities.

Williams: I am actually talking to you from Germany. I was on an official mission outside of the area. I went to a meeting in the Republic of the Congo in mid-March and as I was coming back, everything started to shut down. Our terrific Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Yacoub El Hillo is on the ground. Yes, look in terms of mercenaries continuing to come into the country on both sides, you know we have the Syrian population of mercenaries which are coming in on both sides of the conflict, it is like a virtual who's who, an alphabet soup of nationalities now. We have Sudanese, Chadians, Russian private military contractors, and I am sure there are other nationalities who are on the ground. Those are the most prominent and reported upon populations that are now serving as mercenaries in Libya, and again this is completely unacceptable.

On the prisoners, look, we are extremely concerned that this population has been released, and is loose on the ground. Many of them, you know, were convicted of serious crimes, including human trafficking, fuels smuggling, violent criminals. We have issued a statement on this, calling on the authorities to get a handle on this population and ensure that they do not pose a risk to civilians, as well as of course, in the case of the human traffickers, to vulnerable migrants and refugee populations in Libya.

Media question: I have a very small question about what Mister Lavrov said: he wishes that the UN would name an envoy from the region. Any comment on that?

Williams: I know that finding a replacement for our former boss is a top priority and I refer you to the Secretary-General's office in New York. I know that it is a process that is urgently being looked at.

Interruption by moderator Alessandra Vellucci, Director of the United Nations Information Service in Geneva: This question has also been asked in New York and the answer is that this is a process, as Stephanie said, as soon as we have any announcements, you will be the first to know.

Media question: I do not know if you saw the comments last night by the GNA Interior Minister saying that they are investigating a possible chemical weapons attack in Salaheddin, whether this was something that you were aware of, and whether they had contacted you to assist with the investigation that they say they are carrying out.

Williams: Yes, indeed, I did have an exchange with the Interior Minister last night, and this is a very concerning report. Now, I would make two comments here. Libya is a signatory to the OPCW, they can certainly go that route in terms of requesting assistance. We have also referred this to the panel of experts who will be looking into it. So again, this is the very, very concerning report.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Geneva', 'Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Sabratha', 'Tarhuna', 'Berlin', 'Tunis', 'Cairo', 'Misrata', 'Benghazi', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'New York City', 'Chad', 'Sudan', 'Germany', 'Republic of the Congo']","Libya situation bleak, truce in name only, arms pouring in, alphabet soup of mercenaries, concerned about chemical weapon use report: UNSMIL's Williams",https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/04/24/libya-situation-bleak-truce-in-name-only-arms-pouring-in-alphabet-soup-of-mercenaries-concerned-about-chemical-weapon-use-report-unsmils-williams/,None,
11398258,2020-04-05,"One year on from the start of Libya's destructive war, UNSMIL renewed yesterday its call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and unity to combat Covid-19.

In its statement, UNSMIL said that ''Today marks one year since the forces of ""Libyan National Army"" Commander General Khalifa Haftar launched their offensive to seize Tripoli, Libya's capital. What resulted is a needless conflict that shattered the hopes of many Libyans for a peaceful political transition via a National Conference that could have paved the way towards unifying the country's long-divided institutions via parliamentary and presidential elections.

The conflict has since escalated into a dangerous and potentially endless proxy war fueled by cynical foreign powers that has now widened geographically with civilians paying the highest price.

Libya's ''conflict has since escalated into a dangerous and potentially endless proxy war fuelled by cynical foreign powers''

The humanitarian situation has deteriorated to levels never previously witnessed in Libya. Between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, UNSMIL documented at least 685 civilian casualties (356 deaths and 329 injured). Around 149,000 people in and around Tripoli have been forced to flee their homes since the beginning of the offensive and nearly 345,000 civilians remain in frontline areas with an additional 749,000 people estimated to live in areas affected by the clashes. It is estimated that around 893,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance.

''It is estimated that around 893,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance.''

The war has also had an appalling impact in terms of damage to and destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and detention facilities. Human rights violations have exponentially increased with attacks against human rights defenders and journalists, doctors, lawyers and judges, migrants and refugees, and deteriorating conditions of detention. Over the past year, UNSMIL has received increasing reports of hundreds of cases of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture, extrajudicial executions by armed groups in towns and cities across Libya, conducted with total impunity.

''Over the past year, UNSMIL has received increasing reports of hundreds of cases of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture, extrajudicial executions by armed groups in towns and cities across Libya, conducted with total impunity.''

The one-year long war had also taken a heavy toll on an already struggling economy. While rich in natural resources, Libya is now heavily indebted with over LYD 100 billion in domestically held debt, another $1 billion in credit lines for domestic fuel imports and LYD 169 billion in outstanding contractual obligations. The oil blockade imposed on 17 January has already resulted in financial losses exceeding $4 billion. The conflict has exacerbated institutional divisions and diverted spending to the war effort which itself is destroying rather than building much-need critical infrastructure. The existence of two separate central banks has prevented any rational monetary or fiscal policy reform and has instead contributed to a domestic banking crisis, which if left unaddressed, will result in potentially catastrophic financial loss.

''The existence of two separate central banks has prevented any rational monetary or fiscal policy reform''

The influx of foreign fighters and advanced weapons systems into the country continues unabated, and their use on the battlefield has directly led to an intensification of the conflict. Despite commitments made by all of the participants at the Berlin Conference, some of these countries have nevertheless continued to brazenly resupply one or the other side of the conflict, in a flagrant disregard of the arms embargo.

''some of these countries (Berlin participants) have nevertheless continued to brazenly resupply one or the other side of the conflict, in a flagrant disregard of the arms embargo.''

The COVID-19 pandemic, which is spreading in Libya, as it is around the world, recognizes neither national boundaries nor frontlines and clearly represents the greatest near-term threat to the welfare and well-being of the Libyan people. The Libyan parties to the conflict and their foreign sponsors should heed the calls made by United Nations Secretary-General Guterres, as well as many concerned Libyans themselves, to halt this war immediately. UNSMIL and the UN family in Libya have spared no effort to address the devastating consequences the war has already inflicted. Our humanitarian agencies are now working around the clock with the relevant Libyan authorities across the country to confront the COVID-19 pandemic.

UNSMIL appeals to all concerned to activate the humanitarian truce immediately and cease all military operations to allow Libyan authorities to respond to the threat of COVID-19. We also call on the parties to this conflict, and their foreign backers, to accept the ceasefire agreement proposed in Geneva, embrace the outcomes of the Berlin conference, implement UN Security Council Resolution 2510, and engage without delay in the three UN-facilitated Libyan-led tracks (military, political, and economic) called for therein.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Berlin', 'Geneva']",Libya's needless conflict shattered hopes of many Libyans for peaceful political transition: UNSMIL,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/04/05/libyas-needless-conflict-shattered-hopes-of-many-libyans-for-peaceful-political-transition-unsmil/,None,
11398259,2020-03-24,"Fighting around Tripoli has continued over the last few days in total disregard for the ''humanitarian pause'' agreed by both combatants as UNSMIL today strongly condemns the violations.

At times the fighting has been intense with numerous reported civilian injuries and at least three civilian deaths caused by indiscriminate shelling.

It will be recalled that the international community (17 March) and UNSMIL (18 March) had called for a ''humanitarian pause'' in fighting in order to focus on fighting the bigger enemy; Coronavirus (Covid19).

UNSMIL added that COVID-19 has no affiliation and breaks through all frontlines, and called on all Libyans to join forces immediately before it is too late to face this overwhelming, fast-spreading threat, which requires consolidating all resources and efforts for the prevention, awareness and treatment of possible victims.

It encouraged the implementation of a consolidated mechanism to face COVID-19 in Libya in close collaboration with WHO and other UN agencies on the ground, and the friends of Libya. The UN family in Libya stands ready to continue to support Libyans in facing this threat, its statement had concluded.

Both the combatant sides, the internationally recognized Libyan government in Tripoli (19 March) and the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA) (21 March), made positive responses to the call for a humanitarian pause.

UNSMIL had welcomed this ''positive responses'' by both parties for a humanitarian pause amidst the worldwide Coronavirus (Covid19) outbreak on 21 March.

Today, Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) and UNSMIL head, Stephanie Williams, strongly condemned today's repeated shelling of the Ain Zara neighbourhood, including the Al Rwemi prison, reportedly by forces affiliated with the Libyan National Army. The statement said that these attacks have resulted in a number of injuries, reportedly including among inmates, prisoners and judicial police officers.

The Acting SRSG called for an immediate halt to the shelling on the prison and the area where the prison is located, to avoid mass casualties among prisoners and prison guards.

Williams Said, ""Despite the calls by many UN Member States, UNSMIL and the Secretary-General for an immediate cessation of hostilities to enable joint approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic, armed clashes, shelling, and mobilisation of forces in Libya continue, with unacceptable disregard for the safety and wellbeing of the civilian population.

""In the past 48 hours, UNSMIL documented more than 13 violations of the humanitarian pause, which resulted in the killing of at least three civilians and injuries to others,"" Williams added.

The Acting SRSG urged the authorities across Libya to release all prisoners who are arbitrarily detained, and consider releasing pre-trial prisoners, and in particular, women, children, persons with disabilities, migrants and refugees in the context of the COVID 19 outbreak.

""The continuation of the fighting risks an undetected and out-of-control spread of the COVID-19,"" Williams warned. She reiterated her call on all parties to the conflict in Libya to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, to abide by the commitments they have publicly made to halt all military operations, and to put the interests of their people and communities first, above any other considerations.

It will be recalled that in reality, the fighting for Tripoli has continued for most days since the 19 January Berlin conference and resultant 12 February UN Security Council resolution endorsing the Berlin outcomes and calling for an immediate truce.

Ironically, both sides of the political divide seem to be making visible progress in mitigating and preparing for Covis19. Libya today reported that there are still no cases of Covid19 in the whole country.

The joint statement said that it strongly supports the efforts of Libyan health authorities across the country as they come together in a spirit of national cohesion, and urge them to take all necessary measures to support the health and well-being of all Libyans.

They added that such a truce would also enable combatants to return home to provide care for relatives who may be at higher risk. They expressed strong hopes that a humanitarian truce will facilitate both Libyan parties' leadership agreeing to the UN-facilitated February 23 draft ceasefire reached in Geneva in the framework of the 5+5 intra-Libyan Joint Military Commission, and returning to political dialogue.

Today, UNSMIL added its support to the statement. It said it welcomes and joins the call by international partners on all parties to the Libyan conflict to declare an immediate humanitarian cessation of hostilities as well as a halt to the continuing transfer of all military equipment and personnel into Libya, in order to allow local authorities to rapidly respond to the unprecedented public health challenge posed by COVID-19.

It added that while UNSMIL continues its efforts in facilitating an inter-Libyan dialogue on the political, military and economic tracks, it urged all parties in Libya to take the bold step in unifying their efforts in facing this pandemic.

COVID-19 has no affiliation and breaks through all frontlines, it said, and called on all Libyans to join forces immediately before it is too late to face this overwhelming, fast-spreading threat, which requires consolidating all resources and efforts for the prevention, awareness and treatment of possible victims.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Libya', 'United States', 'Netherlands', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'Algeria', 'Germany', 'Tunisia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Geneva']",International community and UNSMIL call for humanitarian truce in Libya in view of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/03/17/international-community-calls-for-humanitarian-truce-in-libya-in-view-of-the-worldwide-coronavirus-outbreak/,None,
11398261,2020-03-01,"In a U.S State Department special briefing on U.S. engagement with Libya to the media in Washington on Friday, the State Department said that the

U.S. Government is immersed in efforts to support an immediate end to Libya's ongoing conflict and minimize toxic foreign interference. It holds the view that the underlying drivers of the conflict can be addressed through political negotiations. It fears a proxy war involving Turkey, Russia, the UAE, and Egypt.

It feels that the inconclusive fighting with unchanged frontlines since 4 April 2019 demonstrates that there is no military solution to the conflict short of a bloodbath or a long-term insurgency.

Both the LNA and the GNA have sought military and financial support from outside backers who seek to leverage these considerable investments to advance their security and commercial interests.

The U.S is asking Khalifa Hafter to ''suspend'' his Tripoli offensive not to surrender (or withdraw) as it sees a political role for him which it feels he can best achieve through the negotiating table.

It feels Benghazi is more stable than Tripoli and while the U.S. has multiple equities and deep and complex relationships with some of the countries interfering in Libya, Libya is not the defining issue in those relationships.

It understands that countries interfering in the Libyan conflict have deep and deeply felt concerns of their own about the role of political Islam, about the stability of their regimes, about regional influence, and the U.S. can't necessarily force them to alter their behaviour.

The oil blockade has been manipulated with the intention of using oil as a political tool.

Hafter is going after the so-called three Ms - the militias, the money, and the Muslim Brotherhood - but his offensive now is directly counterproductive to those goals. It is empowering militias in Tripoli. It's empowering extremists. It's making it impossible to track how the money's being distributed across the country. Suspending the Tripoli offensive would better serve his goals.

There is an interplay between what's going on in the conflict in Idlib (Syria) and the conflict in Tripoli between Russia and Turkey. Syria is a huge priority for Turkey and Russia and more important than Libya. The Libyan factor has complicated this equation.

The Russian presence through thousands of Wagner mercenaries is immensely destabilizing and a big game changer making regional and U.S. interests at stake in Libya.

Some people think the U.S. can just snap its fingers and solve the Libyan problem - which is not the case.

Here is the full briefing as reported by the U.S. State Department:

MODERATOR: Today's briefing will be on background, attribution to a senior department official or State Department official. And [Senior State Department Official] is going to start with remarks and then will take a few of your questions. We think we have about 20 minutes or so. Go ahead.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah. So on Libya, U.S. Government is immersed in efforts to support an immediate end to Libya's ongoing conflict and minimize toxic foreign interference, with the goal of fostering a stable, unified, and democratic Libyan state that can partner with the U.S. to defeat terrorism and stabilize energy production. We meet regularly with Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, General Khalifa Haftar, and other Libyan leaders as part of our effort to de-escalate the fighting and demonstrate that the underlying drivers of the conflict can be addressed through political negotiations.

This risks becoming a proxy war. The Libyan civil conflict, reignited in April 2019 when Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army launched a military offensive to seize Tripoli from the Government of National Accord, which was established by the 2015 Libya political agreement and is led by Prime Minister al-Sarraj. Ten months of inconclusive fighting with frontlines roughly 10 miles outside central Tripoli that have remained largely unchanged since April 5th last year have amply demonstrated that there is no military solution to the conflict, short of a bloodbath or a long-term insurgency.

Both the LNA and the GNA have sought military and financial support from outside backers, transforming the Tripoli conflict into a regional proxy war over political and economic clout in the broader Middle East. All sides seek to leverage these considerable investments to advance their security and commercial interests.

Our embassy is supporting efforts by the UN Special Representative Ghassan Salame to negotiate a cessation of hostilities and a comprehensive political settlement. We coordinate closely with the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Egypt, UAE, and Turkey. On January 19th, the UN and the German Government convened the long-anticipated Berlin conference, in which all key foreign players in the Libya conflict committed to suspend military operations and halt the influx of foreign weapons and fighters. We support UNSMIL as the mediator able to move this process forward. That's the external track.

UNSMIL, the UN mission, is also focusing on an internal track with a series of intra-Libyan dialogues which seek to address difficult issues, including the role played by militia groups throughout the country, the reunification of Libya's economic institutions, and disagreement about which political groups should be represented in a future Libyan government. The UN convened in Geneva just Wednesday of this week Libya's first political dialogue since the LNA's military offensive on Tripoli last April with the goal of bringing together members from the eastern House of Representatives, the so-called High State Council, and broader Libyan civil society. Unfortunately, some invited participants are attempting to veto that process in a self-serving bid to prolong the unsustainable status quo.

The UN has also succeeded in facilitating parallel economic talks in Tunis on January 6th, Cairo February 9th to 10th, with the goal of spurring Libyan factions to bolster economic transparency and promote the equitable distribution of oil revenues. Earlier this month, the GNA and the LNA each sent five representatives to the February 4 to 9 UN-led security discussions in Geneva, the so-called 5+5 dialogue, on the modalities of ceasefire and the terms of the withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries.

We can talk a little bit about the humanitarian situation. Obviously, this conflict has had a humanitarian impact. But maybe the three messages I'd like to highlight today are, first of all, that the LNA offensive should be suspended immediately so that political negotiations can succeed. As I said, this has the risk of becoming a large-scale proxy war involving Turkey, Russia, the UAE, and Egypt.

It's clear that in asking the LNA to suspend its offensive we're not - that there is a role for Haftar in shaping Libya's political future. Nobody is saying there isn't; nobody is asking him to surrender. But we think that the way he is going to advance the goals he's talking about are best - is best done at the negotiating table. And of course, this is just the first step in de-escalating the overall conflict. But it's got to begin with suspending the current offensive.

The second point is we support the UN role in convening the negotiations that have taken place between both sides on the military, economic, and political issues. Ghassan Salame we think is doing an excellent job, and we call on all parties to support his efforts.

And the third thing is we're determined to reopen our embassy in Tripoli as soon as humanly possible. That is not going to be an immediate prospect because of security conditions. Our property was looted. We have a long way to go. It's going to begin with baby steps, with day trips, then with longer overnights, and then ultimately trying to get some physical facilities on the ground.

I got to post last August and only made my first trip to Libya two weeks ago. I got to Benghazi, which is in a more stable part of the country. I met with Haftar there. I have met with Sarraj multiple times, but it's hard to do it inside the - I can't get into Tripoli just yet.

Obviously, the legacy of what happened in Benghazi in 2012 very much colors the concern, the considerations that go into sending any Americans back into Libya, so that there's a regimented clearance process for that kind of travel. But again, I am able to meet with leaders from all sides, if not in Libya then in the neighborhood.

QUESTION: Thanks. Katrina Manson from Financial Times. Thanks. Given your call for Haftar to stop, can you tell us a little bit about the support that UAE and others have been providing to him and the kind of pressure you're putting on them to stop their support and encourage him to cease his operations, too?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: We have spoken to all of the parties that are involved in supplying all sides of this conflict. The approach we're taking is to try to essentially get across the idea it's not in anyone's interest for you to fuel this conflict; it's only going to escalate, as we've seen it doing, into a regional proxy war.

Obviously, some of these countries are countries with which the U.S. has multiple equities and deep and complex relationships. I - so Libya is not the defining issue in those relationships necessarily, but they have heard our message. The conflict - to the extent the conflict is fueled in part by outside actors, they have deep and deeply felt concerns of their own about the role of political Islam, about the stability of their regimes, about regional influence. And we can share our views, but we can't necessarily force them to alter their behavior.

Our main point is you've all signed up to obligations under the UN, and the UN has passed the resolutions calling on everybody to observe an arms embargo. You should observe it. And that applies to the UAE; it applies to Turkey; it applies to Russia and a few others.

MODERATOR: Humeyra.

QUESTION: Hi. Are you doing anything to get the oil blockade lifted? A couple of days ago, the eastern side said they can't force an end to it because it was a popular decision. You're doing a bunch of things with them. You're talking to them. But are you doing anything specifically with regards to the oil?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I mean, we have called for an end to the oil blockade. We have spoken with the various parties about the importance of ending this blockade as quickly as possible. We're not really convinced this is the result of a popular or tribal dissatisfaction. I think this has been - whatever concerns there were originally that at a local level we think have been manipulated with the intention of using oil as a political tool.

That's obviously not in Libya's interests. The result now is that Libya's oil revenues have almost entirely been shut off. The country is having to live off its reserves, which are not insubstantial, but this is not a way to manage the country. And it is already having a humanitarian impact, and we believe that this should stop soon.

We met with Mr. Mustafa Sanalla, the head of the National Oil Corporation, last week before I came back. He's working on this issue. He'll be at what's called CERAWeek in Houston in March. We're trying to use that as a platform also to send the signal that this oil blockade needs to stop.

MODERATOR: Carol.

QUESTION: I was wondering what you - what your assessment or what's the U.S. assessment of what it would really take for General Haftar to stand down in the offensive against Tripoli. And short of calling for it to end, is the United States doing anything to make that happen other than calling for an end to it?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Time will tell. I'm going to leave it at that.

QUESTION: Well, the first one is what would it take for him? What's he looking for? What would it take for him to stand down?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I mean, you'd have to ask him. He is - I think everybody's who's dealt with him has come away understanding that this is a person with a very fixed view of things. But if he really does have his country's best interests at heart, if he really is determined, which he says he is, to go after what we call the three Ms - the militias, the money, and the Muslim Brotherhood - what he is doing now is directly counterproductive to those goals. He is - his offensive is empowering militias in Tripoli. It's empowering extremists. It's making it impossible to track how the money's being distributed across the country. So if he's really interested in doing the best thing for Libya, and I will take him at his word that he is, then the thing to do right now would be to suspend his activities - again, we're not calling on him to surrender - suspend the offensive and give the negotiating process a chance.

MODERATOR: Okay. Michael.

QUESTION: Sir, you mentioned the toxic role that outside players have had in Libya. And can you please explain: What specifically is Turkey doing? Its Turkish military personnel plus Turkish-backed Syrian fighters seem to have been imported there in the thousands. What, specifically, is the Russians doing with the Wagner Group? What is the UAE doing? Can you give us some information as to what these specific outside forces are doing in the conflict in numbers and weapons systems they're bringing in? And his - just to clarify maybe your answer to a previous question, has any of this slowed down or abated, or is it just ongoing despite calls for them to observe an --

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, in answer to the last part, I think I'd say things do wax and wane a little bit, but that kind of relates to how I would answer your question overall. There was a sequence to this. It kind of began on one side. And as that side ramped up, and as they supported Haftar and as his offensive became more and more threatening to the government in Tripoli, that government went out and asked for help. They went to the Turks and they said, we need you. And the Turks said okay. And they had their reasons. There was the maritime agreement that was signed on maritime economic zones and possible oil exploration that was, I think, the price the Turks asked for. But they made a commitment to then support the government in Tripoli, which has actually, or at least until a couple weeks ago, stabilized the situation and was probably responsible for the parties deciding to take part in these 5+5 talks in Geneva.

When folks look eyeball to eyeball and say do we really want this to escalate? Maybe not. I think the Emiratis at that point told Haftar you should go to Geneva. The Turks encouraged the GNA to do that. But where it goes from here is an open question.

The thing with Turkey is complicated by what's going on in Idlib now. The Russians have got the Turks in a very difficult situation. And there's an interplay between what's going on in Idlib and what's going on in Tripoli that I don't think anyone has completely figured out yet. The Russian presence, of course, the thousands of Wagner mercenaries is immensely destabilizing. And that was kind of the big game changer back in the fall when that - when people woke up and realized this presence was there in support of Haftar. And it became clear that not just regional, but even U.S. interests were also at stake here, because it's clear the Russians see strategic advantage now in Libya - low risk and high gain.

And so where this goes from here will be a factor of whether ultimately these - what's now a proxy war involving proxies, whether this actually becomes a conflict between - it's not hard to imagine the Turks shooting - killing Russians in Tripoli, or the Turks shooting down an Emirati plane, or an - or the - there could easily be something that now raises this to international conflict levels. And our view is that, and our belief is that none of these parties wants things to reach that level.

QUESTION: And who are the Syrian - the Turkish-backed Syrian fighters that are going there? And what about the Emiratis, what are they doing?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: My - I mean, there have been varying degrees of sophisticated weaponry introduced by various sides. I'm not an expert on all that. My impression is the Emiratis have pulled back a little bit in recent days or weeks. The interesting thing in a way is that each side has got its mercenaries. Haftar's got the Wagner folks. And for some reason, Erdogan decided to send these Free Syrian Army fighters from Idlib. I don't pretend to understand why he started with them. There are regular Turkish forces also in Tripoli, and a really good point of departure, if we could first consolidate the ceasefire, would then be to start getting the mercenaries out.

QUESTION: What is the U.S. prepared to do in terms of using its leverage or influence, diplomatic or military power, to change the situation? Because the way you're describing it, it does sound almost like you're a spectator on the sides, and these - part of Russia's seizing the initiative, Turkey is taking action. Is Libya a place where the U.S. will just have to watch these - this proxy war play out?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I mean, I think my answer to that would be it's interesting to see how all of the parties, both in Libya and among the Europeans, believe that the United States influence can play a pivotal role in bringing this to a resolution, and not through military force. I think it's because so many of these parties have specific vested interests, and nobody - there are very few parties who sort of stand back and look at this from a kind of distant, more objective perspective. I think one reason the Germans were brought into this was because some people thought Merkel was kind of removed from the fray in all this, and it would be a nice way for her to begin to leave her term in office, by bringing Europeans together on an important issue. And the Germans have played an important role here.

I don't think anybody expects the U.S. to solve this thing, or if they do - I mean, I should rephrase that. Some people think the U.S. can just snap its fingers and solve this thing. Folks in Libya. That's not the case. Our role, I think, is to help mobilize and galvanize international support for a solution both internally and externally.

QUESTION: How concerned are you about the terrorist threat given what's going on on the ground?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: This is very much one of the downsides of this conflict. It's taken - people's eyes has been taken - have been taken off the ball of the ability of terrorist groups to consolidate themselves. We saw them start to reform last year. AFRICOM conducted some strikes. Some of these were effective. And our sense is the threat has abated to an extent in terms of an organized threat, but Libya - especially if you look down in the south - is such a free for all that it's - we're already getting indications this is an environment that's ripe for terrorist groups to reform themselves. And we want - one of the reasons this conflict needs to end as quickly as possible is so that you can have a stable, effective government in Tripoli that can be an effective partner in dealing with this threat.

MODERATOR: Time for one more question. Anyone?

QUESTION: Hi. Just can you expand a little bit more on how the Idlib situation is playing out here? Because it is reaching kind of a climax there.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: I mean, you really need to talk to Ambassador Satterfield. I did go to Ankara about three weeks ago, and he and I made the rounds and talked to the Turks and talked about how their presence was an important factor in Tripoli, and it's important to calibrate this presence correctly. And ultimately, of course, we want all foreign countries to get their troops out of Libya. The Idlib thing was starting to come to a crescendo then. There have just been some Turkish troops killed.

I mean, all I can say - my sense is that Syria, northern Syria is a huge priority for the Turks, also for the Russians, probably more important than Libya. But now the Libyan factor has complicated the equation for all concerned. And one thing you can be sure of is Moscow will figure out how to use this to maximum leverage, maximum advantage, as they pursue their interests in that particular region, both in consolidating Assad's regime and in trying to gain a foothold in the Southern Med.

QUESTION: And what did your contacts with the Russians - you said you went to Ankara, but have you been talking to the Russians?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, I've had a couple of bilaterals with Bogdanov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, on the margins of these meetings in Berlin. Our ambassador in Moscow, Ambassador Sullivan, has met with Bogdanov. So we've begun to kind of trade views, but we don't have an established bilateral pattern yet.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Benghazi', 'United States', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Geneva', 'Idlib Governorate', 'Berlin', 'Tunis', 'Cairo', 'Italy']",U.S State Department briefing on Libya: The U.S is asking Khalifa Hafter to ''suspend'' his Tripoli offensive not withdraw or surrender,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/03/01/u-s-state-department-briefing-on-libya-the-u-s-is-asking-khalifa-hafter-to-suspend-his-tripoli-offensive-not-withdraw-or-surrender/,None,
11398377,2020-08-09,"In a meeting held Saturday between Libya's internationally recognized prime minister, Faiez Serraj, and Libya's three main official oversight bodies, the Administrative Control Authority, the Audit Bureau, and the Anti-Corruption Commission, Serraj stressed his full support of the bodies to conduct investigations and inspections of all files related to corruption and waste of public funds.

He also stressed that all institutions of the government sector must comply and cooperate with these bodies, stressing the need to establish the principle of transparency and integrity, and the rules of governance.

Serraj also confirmed his full support of the agreement between the three bodies to formation a national team to develop the national strategy to combat corruption.

During the meeting it was also agreed to activate the existing but unused financial disclosure system for state officials and speed up the adoption of the public sector corporate governance manual.

Analysis

It is unclear why Serraj has chosen this time to raise the issue of state-sector corruption. It may be just posturing and putting on a show to reduce public disquiet. There have been more reports of internal fissures amongst the ruling western Libyan elite. Since the external enemy, Hafter, has been pushed afar to the Sirte-Jufra unofficial ceasefire line, the stakeholders in Tripoli have once again started to turn on each other.

Ultimately, they lack any domestic legitimacy and accountability with the Libya's political split meaning that its parliament is equally split and redundant.

The failure to control the runaway Coronavirus outbreak despite spending LD 500 million (compared to Tunisia's miniscule budget) has started a finger-pointing round robin.

The Presidency Council has turned on each other as they object to Serraj's unilateral rule. The continued ineffectiveness and simmering public anger at rising coronavirus cases, power, petrol, diesel, cooking gas, cash, and water shortages, has meant everyone is trying to avoid taking blame and attempting to apportion blame on others.

Meanwhile, western Libyan militias continue to jostle for more power, positions and remuneration in compensation for their ''victory'', as they see it, of keeping Hafter out of Tripoli.

The problem is the three state entities that are charged with oversight of the state bureaucracy - are themselves state bureaucracies. Bureaucracies are bureaucracies and are not best suited to overseeing or purging their fellow bureaucrats. In effect there is a silent and unspoken conspiracy by Libya's bureaucracy against the public.

They make noise and play at reform, oversight, investigations, accountability, and justice - but in reality, there is no real incentive for them to do so. More importantly, there is much disincentive for Libyan bureaucracies to expose one another - as they all have skeletons in their cupboards. They all feed off the rentier state system and are not interested in rocking the boat or bringing the whole corrupt edifice crashing down.

Ultimately, they are not accountable to the executive government of Serraj, but to the now redundant and split parliament. Like most of Libya's bodies since the redundant 2015 Skhirat Libyan Political Agreement, they operate in a void without any accountability and without the fear of being sacked.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Tunisia', 'Skhirat']",Serraj anti-corruption drive: announces his full support for oversight entities and seeks to enforce financial disclosure by top officials - report and analysis,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/08/09/serraj-anti-corruption-drive-announces-his-full-support-for-oversight-entities-and-seeks-to-enforce-financial-disclosure-by-top-officials-report-and-analysis/,None,
11398582,2020-04-22,"In a televised interview for Libyan WTV channel yesterday, Finance Minister Faraj Bumtari, representing the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, accused the Tripoli Central Bank of Libya (CBL) of opposing his government's economic reform policies and not controlling foreign currency in the market.

And although Bumtari attempted to cloak his specific attack on Tripoli CBL Governor Saddek El-Kaber, he all but pointed the finger at him when he pointed out that something changed after 2011 ""which caused economic crises in the country''. Upon further questioning, he refused to elaborate. However, many analysts have interpreted it as a reference to El-Kaber being appointed by the National Transitional Council (NTC) in 2011 as Governor of the CBL. His call for the reorganization of the CBL board is seen as tantamount to calling for El-Kaber's sacking.

The attack comes on the back of increased criticism of the Tripoli CBL and its Governor Saddek El-Kaber over the last two weeks by Libya's internationally recognized Prime Minister Faiez Serraj, the Libyan Business Council and the Libyan Banking Association.

In his lengthy televised critique, Bumtari said that corruption will grow in Libya when there is an active black market, pointing out that the rise in the dollar against the dinar indicates that there is a problem with liquidity, and a lack of foreign exchange control by the CBL.

The implication is that the CBL is either encouraging or turning a blind eye to the hard currency black-market which is causing hardship to consumers through inflated prices and a reduction in spending power and standards of living. There is a common perception in Libya that the black-market traders are in bed with CBL / commercial bank staff.

He pointed out that in 2019, US$10 billion was available to Libyan citizens on the black-market, adding: ""This was an opportunity for corruption, because it is money without monetary control, which confirms the spread of corruption.""

He also noted that neighbouring countries such as Egypt and Tunisia do not have this amount of financial corruption because there is ""strict"" financial control over cash, which reduces the rates of corruption, ""the situation in Libya is different, and those who get money illegally can move it to another country.""

With regards to the balance of payments, he said that this indicator was negatively in the years following 2011, except for one year, ""indicating corruption in the state, money laundering smuggling. This is evidence of a problem with monetary control and financial transactions outside the banking system.""

Bumtari denied rumours that he had filed a complaint against the CBL Governor with the Attorney General but acknowledged the existence of altercations in the correspondence between the two parties - but not to the extent of filing a legal complaint.

""The nature of our work is to cooperate as institutions, and there are some correspondence that have had quarrels. The purpose of achieving collective action is to find a real solution to the problem in which the Libyan economy is in, including taking into account the sensitive segments of society with limited income, retirees, basic pension holders, export and import conditions, etc.""

He called on CBL to restructure and modernize its system and mechanism, and work on the formation of a new board of directors, to establish ""correct and consistent policies"", adding that the central bank should open the way for his government to complete economic reforms. ""As long as there is no foreign exchange control from the CBL, the dollar will raise against the dinar."", he explained. The black-market rate has recently shot up from the high three-dinar nineties to over five diners per US dollar.

He reiterated that his government is considering replacing direct fuel subsidies (with direct cash payments) and resuming the stalled Family Allowance, noting that this will only be done by ensuring monetary policy and not pumping money abroad, so that it benefits the local economy.

Bumtari also mentioned that the Libyan economy has been suffering since the February 2011 revolution, especially with the decline of Libya's oil production capacity, and low international oil prices. ''This required reform of monetary policy and adjustment of the exchange rate and solving the liquidity problem, but the CBL opposed the changing the Libyan dinar's exchange rate, and there was an unjustified fear of this move by the CBL.""

He stressed the need for the CBL to control the flow of the dollar (in the black-market) and not in a random way, ""the dollar is not a food commodity, and we must coordinate together by reference to the banking law, the policy of the government seeks to get rid of the smuggling and laundering of money, and to remedy inflation, which requires adjustment of the exchange rate, but the CBL did not respond to us, and there was a problem in opening direct remittances to small traders, which damaged the Ministry of Finance and reduced its revenues.""

''The problem with the central bank is not with individuals but with an institution, there must be a monetary policy that cooperates with macroeconomic policies,"" pointing out that something changed after 2011, refusing to disclose this thing, ""which caused economic crises in the country. Monetary policy opposes the process of adjustment of the Libyan dinar exchange rate (devaluation) that would have treated many things and resumed development projects''.

As mentioned earlier, CBL Governor El-Kaber has come in for some fierce criticism from a multiplicity of sides recently.

On 8 April, Faiez Serraj devoted most of his televised address, ostensibly to criticise Khalifa Hafter's war on Tripoli on its one-year anniversary - to criticising El-Kaber. The critique was part of an ongoing battle between the Tripoli CBL and the Tripoli government as to who has ultimate control over economic and monetary policy.

Serraj had complained that the CBL was too rigid in its decisions during times of crisis, including the Coronavirus outbreak, the oil production/export stoppage and the war on Tripoli - that Libya was going through.

He had criticised the CBL for halting of the opening of LCs at a critical time for the country time when other countries around the world were increasing their strategic stocks of medical and food supplies. He placed the responsibility of this delay on El-Kaber, warning on 8 April that even if he did resume the issuing of LCs, it could be too late as the goods Libya needs may no longer be available during this Coronavirus crisis.

Serraj had said that his government through its Economy Ministry should be the competent authority making the country's economic decisions - and not the CBL - and that the CBL should solve the country's bank queues instead.

He had said that the CBL failed to come up with reform policies - because its board is split and called for the reunification of the its board.

The CBL should reform its institutions under its competency, make liquidity available, reduce bank queues, complete its board, set foreign currency sales surcharge - instead of the government - and provide a monetary policy - by concentrating on its areas of competency, Serraj had added.

The Libyan Business Council criticises the CBL and the Serraj government

Furthermore, on 16 April the Libyan Business Council had warned of the possibility of food shortages and price increases, especially in foodstuffs, due to the inflexible policies introduced by the Tripoli CBL on the opening of LCs.

Speaking to Libya Herald by phone from Tripoli, LBC Chairman Abdalla Fellah was very dismissive of the CBL's belated decision (20 April) to resume the opening of selective LCs. He was very critical of both it and the Serraj government for not undertaking real economic reforms in Libya. He considered the September 2018 reforms as purely a revenue-raising mechanism by the Serraj government and the CBL - not true reforms.

Fellah insisted as long as the state sector still dominates the Libyan economy, with the state-sector salaries taking most of the state budget - there can be no talk of real reforms. He insisted that the private sector must be in the lead in the Libyan economy - if the country wants to make real progress.

The LBC had said that this was especially the case in view of the current conditions the country is going through and their ramification on prices, supplies and trade.

Fellah, had warned of the upward increases in prices in the local market and his fear of the scarcity of goods, especially food stuffs, due to the inability to import and the usual flow of goods as a result of the prohibitive requirements contained in the CBL's 8 April publication No. (2) to local banks on the conditions for opening LCs.

In a very damning swipe at the CBL, Fellah had said that the CBL's new conditions for opening LCs has returned businesses to the ''times of directed trade'', in a subtle reference to the bad old Qaddafi days where supporters and cronies of the regime received exclusive preferential treatment.

The accusation had come as the CBL had published a list of select companies it had opened LCs for. Accusations of corruption and favouritism had already been directed at it.

Fellah had added that this prohibitive LC policy expressly reflects the central bank's hegemony in its restrictive decisions and publications that don't take into account current difficult circumstances that the world is going through in general and Libya in particular, which will have consequences for the Libyan market and therefore on the citizen in the form of scarcity of goods and high prices.

In the same context, the LBC referred to the Libyan Banking Association's letter of 15 April to the CBL raising the same concerns about the scarcity of goods and price rises if a flexible mechanism in the implementation of documentary credits was not reached soon in order to easily provide the necessary goods to citizens at these difficult times.

From the CBL's point view, in lieu of the adoption of Libya's permanent constitution and subsequent full elections, the CBL considers the successive governments since the 2011 revolution that overthrew the 42-year old Qaddafi regime, as short-term, interim governments with questioned legitimacy and, in the CBL's view, limited mandate and authority. To this end, it sees itself as the apolitical long-term custodian of Libya's accumulated oil wealth. It expects prudence and sustainable policies from these interim governments and fears their populist spendthrift policies seeking election or re-election.

This is especially the case in view of the war on Tripoli since April 2019, the oil blockade since January this year and the Coronavirus curfew since March.

It will be recalled that by opening LCs through the CBL - via their banks - importing Libyan companies gain access to the official lower exchange rate, as opposed to the black-market rate - and hence the clamour for LCs. Imports through official LCs are cheaper and less inflationary, but they use up fast depleting foreign currency reserves.

CBL accountable to no-one during political vacuum since 2014

Unfortunately, El-Kaber operates without accountability or control in a state with no institutions and a split parliament. His split board has failed to meet since the 2014 Libya Dawn militia coup that has split the country since. For what it is worth, the internationally recognized parliament has sacked him twice. He has refused to go, taking full advantage of Libya's political split and power and legitimacy vacuums. His only support, at the moment, seems to be the international community - including recognition by the World Bank/IMF.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Tunisia', 'Egypt']",Minister of Finance acusses CBL of opposing reform policies and not controlling foreign currency flow - calls for reorganization of CBL board,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/04/22/minister-of-finance-acusses-cbl-of-opposing-reform-policies-and-not-controlling-foreign-currency-flow-calls-for-reorganization-of-cbl-board/,None,
11398583,2020-04-16,"The Libya Business Council (LBC), the only legally recognized Libya-wide business council representing businesses, warned today of the possibility of food shortages and price increases, especially in foodstuffs, due to the inflexible policies introduced by the Tripoli Central Bank of Libya (CBL) on the opening of Letters of Credit.

The LBC said that this was especially the case in view of the current conditions the country is going through, in reference to war on Tripoli, the oil blockade and the outbreak of the Coronavirus - and their ramification on prices, supplies and trade.

The LBC said that this was especially the case in view of the current conditions the country is going through, in reference to war on Tripoli, the oil blockade and the outbreak of the Coronavirus - and their ramification on prices, supplies and trade.

LBC chairman Abdalla Fellah, warned of the upward increases in prices in the local market and his fear of the scarcity of goods, especially food stuffs, due to the inability to import and the usual flow of goods as a result of the prohibitive requirements contained in the CBL's 8 April publication No. (2) to local banks on the conditions for opening LCs.

In a very damning swipe at the CBL, Fellah said that the CBL's new conditions for opening LCs has returned businesses to the ''times of directed trade'', in a subtle reference to the bad old Qaddafi days where supporters and cronies of the regime received exclusive preferential treatment.

The accusation comes as the CBL today published a list of select companies it had opened LCs for. Accusations of corruption and favouritism have already been directed at it.

Fellah added that this prohibitive LC policy expressly reflects the central bank's hegemony in its restrictive decisions and publications that don't take into account current difficult circumstances that the world is going through in general and Libya in particular, which will have consequences for the Libyan market and therefore on the citizen in the form of scarcity of goods and high prices.

In the same context, the LBC referred to the Libyan Banking Association's letter of 15 April to the CBL raising the same concerns about the scarcity of goods and price rises if a flexible mechanism in the implementation of documentary credits was not reached soon in order to easily provide the necessary goods to citizens at these difficult times.

Putting the call by the LBC for the CBL to be more flexible in its LC opening policy, it will be recalled that there is an ongoing battle between the Tripoli CBL and the Tripoli government as to who has ultimate control over economic and monetary policy.

The Tripoli CBL claims it is a technocratic monetary body not involved in political decisions and is the custodian of Libya's reserves of wealth accumulated in the 42-year Qaddafi era.

However, as politics and economics are two sides of the same coin, the CBL has been accused of being in total control of spending decisions.

On 8 April, Libya's internationally recognized Prime Minister, Faiez Serraj, launched a damning broadside on the CBL and its Governor Saddek El Kaber. He accused it of:

He complained that the CBL was too rigid in its decisions during times of crisis and referred to the rest of the world and their extraordinary measures during the Coronavirus outbreak - let alone Libya and its virtually permanent state of crisis.

He saw no logic or wisdom in the halting of the opening of LCs at a critical time for the country time when other countries were increasing their strategic stocks of medical and food supplies. He placed the responsibility of this delay on El-Kaber, warning that even if he did recommence the issuing of LCs, it could be too late as the goods Libya needs may no longer be available during this Coronavirus crisis.

Serraj said that his government through its Economy Ministry should be the competent authority making the country's economic decisions - and not the CBL. He complained that Libya's monetary and financial policy and liquidity problems are the concern of the CBL and that it should do that job - including solve the country's bank queues. Serraj said that its interference in all other government policy was causing confusion not solving other problems and was very dangerous and needed solving.

He said that the CBL failed to come up with reform policies - because its board is split and called for the reunification of the its board.

He said the CBL had become an unknown ''black box'' that no one knew how it operated. It wanted to interfere in all state institutions - but did not want anyone else to interfere in it, adding that It should accept its responsibility.

The CBL should reform its institutions under its competency, make liquidity available, reduce bank queues, complete its board, set foreign currency sales surcharge - instead of the government - and provide a monetary policy - by concentrating on its areas of competency.

In lieu of the adoption of Libya's permanent constitution and subsequent full elections, the CBL considers the successive governments since the 2011 revolution that overthrew the 42-year old Qaddafi regime, as short-term interim governments with questioned legitimacy and, in the CBL's view, limited mandate and authority. To this end it sees itself as the long-term custodian of Libya's accumulated oil wealth. It expects prudence and sustainable policies from these interim governments.

This is especially saw in the case in view of the war on Tripoli since April 2019, the oil blockade since January this year and the Coronavirus curfew since March.

11398622,2020-04-30,"Human Rights Watch said in a report released yesterday that an apparently unlawful drone attack by the United Arab Emirates that hit the Al-Sunbulah biscuit factory in Wadi al-Rabie, Libya, south of Tripoli, on November 18, 2019, killed 8 civilians and wounded 27.

The report said the UAE appeared to take little or no action to minimize harm to civilians in its attack and should conduct a transparent investigation of this incident, make the results public, and compensate victims or their families.

It reported that since the current armed conflict in Tripoli erupted in April 2019, the UAE has been conducting air and drone strikes to support the Khalifa Hafter Libyan National Army (LNA), one of two major Libyan parties to the conflict, some of which have resulted in civilian casualties. All casualties in the November incident were civilian factory workers, including 7 Libyans and 28 foreign nationals, all of them men.

""The UAE attacked a factory that makes food products, with no indication there were any military targets,"" said Eric Goldstein, acting Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""The failure to verify that the workers there were civilians and that there was no legitimate military target would show recklessness and bad intelligence.""

It reported that a Human Rights Watch researcher visited the scene of the attack in December 2019 and documented material damage to the factory from drone-launched guided missiles and found remnants of the weapons. Human Rights Watch did not observe any military targets in the area. The strikes damaged the building and destroyed a truck and a car. The factory stopped operating after the attack.

It added that at the strike site, Human Rights Watch found remnants of at least four Blue Arrow-7 (BA-7) laser-guided missiles that were launched by a Wing Loong-II drone, adding that in the Libyan conflict only the UAE uses this type of drone and missile.

The report said that Human Rights Watch interviewed five people who had been at the site, who said there were five missiles, all launched within a few minutes. The researcher met with two employees of Al-Sunbulah company who were present on the day of the strike and with three other employees who had been injured during the attack and were recovering at a nearby facility belonging to the company.

The attack site is a factory compound with several industrial hangars mostly used as warehouses to store raw materials and equipment. The company produces over 20 types of food items. The surrounding area was mostly farmland, although Human Rights Watch saw some individual houses and other factories - including a paper napkin factory and a wheat mill - that were not near each other.

The report said that satellite imagery taken since early April 2019 shows construction of a possible checkpoint on the main road running alongside the factory compound, about 75 meters east of the Omar Ibn al-Khatab mosque. Imagery since February 2020 shows barriers on the road in the vicinity of the possible checkpoint. When Human Rights Watch visited the site in December 2019 researchers saw no sign that armed groups had been at the facility. The employees interviewed said the closest military presence at the time of the attack was a field hospital at a different mosque at least 1.5 kilometers away. At the time of the visit, the researcher heard artillery shelling in the distance and employees said that the front line was 5 to 6 kilometers away.

A Human Rights Watch researcher visited the scene of the attack in December 2019, the report added, and documented material damage to the factory from drone-launched guided missiles and found remnants of the weapons.Four of the employees said that seven of their co-workers died on the spot and that the eighth - from Bangladesh - died from his wounds about 10 days later in a Tripoli hospital. The UAE has not publicly commented on its role in the attack or offered compensation for the civilian losses.

The report said that according to media, UN, and other reports, the UAE has carried out at least five other strikes that resulted in civilian casualties since April 2019. These include a July attack against a migrant detention center in Tajoura, near Tripoli, that killed at least 50 migrants and asylum seekers of various nationalities. In addition to drones, the UAE has supplied the LNA with weapons, ammunition, and other combat materials such as armored vehicles, in violation of a 2011 UN Security Council arms embargo that prohibits such transfers, according to reports from the UN Panel of Experts on Libya.

The report said that the UAE's sustained military support for the LAAF, an eastern armed group with a well-established record of serious laws of war and human rights abuses, risks making the UAE complicit in these abuses and could expose it to scrutiny by international investigations. It added that Human Rights Watch had written to UAE authorities on April 17, 2020 requesting information about any investigation they may have conducted into the drone strikes of November 18 and any steps taken to minimize civilian harm; as of the time of publication we received no response.

Governance in Libya remains divided between two entities engaged in an armed conflict since April 2019: the internationally recognized and Tripoli-based Government of National Accord and the rival Interim Government based in eastern Libya that is affiliated with the LNA. Calls by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and others for a ""humanitarian pause"" in the armed conflict to allow authorities to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic that has started to spread in the country have so far gone unheeded.

To help end the cycle of impunity in Libya, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva should, during its upcoming session in June, establish an International Commission of Inquiry to document violations, identify those responsible, including external actors, preserve evidence where possible for future criminal proceedings, and publicly report on the human rights situation in Libya, Human Rights Watch said.

All parties to the conflict in Libya are obliged to abide by the laws of war. Civilians and civilian objects may never be the object of attacks. Warring parties are required to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects and to refrain from attacks that would disproportionately harm civilians or fail to discriminate between combatants and civilians.

Those who commit, order, assist, or have command responsibility for war crimes in Libya are subject to prosecution by domestic courts or the International Criminal Court, which has a mandate over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed there since February 15, 2011.

""UAE drones and planes have been pounding Tripoli for a year now with apparent scant respect for civilian life,"" Goldstein said. ""There is a pressing need for the United Nations Human Rights Council to scrutinize the UAE's bloody record in Libya.""

Parties to the Conflict

One of the two major opposing Libyan parties to the conflict, the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), under the command of Khalifa Hiftar, is supported by multiple armed groups, including from along the western Libyan coastal towns of Sebratha and Sorman, and from Tarhouna. On April 13, the internationally recognized Government of National Accord pushed Hiftar's forces out of the western coastal towns and regained control. Militias with a strict Salafi Islamist agenda also support the LAAF.

The group has received military support from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Egypt despite the Libya arms embargo. The UAE operates a military airbase in eastern Libya, supplies weapons and ammunition to the LAAF, and its warplanes and armed drones have operated in support of the LAAF. Foreign fighters from Sudan and Chad and Russian fighters from a private security company reportedly support the armed group. Syrian fighters backed by Russia also reportedly support the group in Libya.

On the opposing side are the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord and affiliated armed groups from western Libya. Turkey, now also a party to the conflict, is the government's main foreign backer, having signed two memorandums of understanding in late 2019 that outline maritime and security cooperation. Turkey provides weapons, armored vehicles, and Bayraktar TB2 armed drones, and reportedly deployed thousands of Turkey-backed Syrian fighters to support the GNA. The GNA has also reportedly contracted foreign fighters from Chad and Sudan to fight on its behalf.

The UN estimates that the year-long armed conflict in Tripoli has killed 356 civilians and wounded 329 as of March 31. The fighting has displaced more than 150,000 people, some of whom live in crowded and unsanitary shelters, unable to return home. The International Organization for Migration estimated that as of end of February, 373,709 people remained internally displaced in Libya.

The Al-Sunbulah Attack

An administrative employee who was at the factory on the day of the strike said that five missiles struck the factory compound a few minutes apart during working hours.

He said the first struck next to a warehouse hangar. Although the building was damaged, no one was killed or wounded. But, he said, a group of workers in the hangar were frightened and ran toward the open fields. The second missile appeared to target them and killed three. The third missile hit another group of fleeing workers, killing one. A fourth missile targeted a cement truck in the compound, killing one person. He said the fifth hit a nearby car whose driver was preparing to drive one of the wounded Bangladeshi workers to a hospital, killing them both.

Accounts by the three injured employees were consistent with the administrative employee's account and corroborated the sequence of events. All three had been wounded by missile shrapnel.

One of the workers, 31, a Chadian national, whose left knee and ankle had been hit with missile fragments from the second missile, said that he fled the factory with a group of workers when the first missile struck:

A group of us ran out of the factory toward the open fields out of fear, after we heard the first missile strike. We were a group of seven or eight people. As we were running the second missile struck and three Libyans were killed by that missile. I was among the five others injured. There was a lot of blood. I crouched next to a wall until someone reached me and I was taken to a hospital. I needed surgery and spent a total of 12 days in a private clinic in Al-Zawiyah Street, in Tripoli.

He and another worker, a 25-year-old Chadian, said that there was no military presence at the factory compound and that the closest point where members of armed groups were present was a mosque some 1.5 km away that had been converted into a field hospital for wounded fighters. A third worker, 29, from Bangladesh, said that on November 27, 10 Bangladeshi workers from the factory were repatriated.

The Weapons Used

Human Rights Watch documented remnants of at least four Blue Arrow-7 (BA-7) laser-guided missiles fired from Wing Loong-II drone, both Chinese manufactured. Remnants seen by Human Rights Watch included distinctive wing brackets, servos - error sensing mechanisms - and gas cylinders specific to the Blue Arrow-7 missile. These remnants were identical to separate remnants of Blue Arrow-7 missiles documented in an earlier attack on a field hospital near Tripoli in July. According to the December 2019 report of the UN Panel of Experts of the Libya Sanctions Committee, ""[T]he BA-7 air-to-surface missile is ballistically paired to be delivered by the Wing Loong II UCAV, and by no other aviation asset identified in Libya to date."" The Panel of Experts report cites Jane's Defense Weekly as saying that the Blue Arrow-7 ""is only in operational use in three countries: China, Kazakhstan and United Arab Emirates.""

These weapons were transferred from China and first spotted on satellite imagery by defense analysts while being operated in the region in late 2017.

UAE personnel operate these drones in support of the LAAF, according to the report of the Panel of Experts. Panel investigations confirmed that these drones and missiles were not directly supplied from the manufacturer or by the country of manufacture and found that the UAE is not complying with the Libya arms embargo imposed by the UN ""for the post-delivery transfer of Wing Loong II UCAV and Blue Arrow (BA-7) systems to Libya.""

The same type of drone and missiles were reportedly used in a January 5 attack on a military college in al-Hadba, Tripoli, killing at least 30 military cadets and injuring 33 more. The Government of National Accord blamed the LAAF for the attack, but the LAAF denied responsibility. Human Rights Watch could not independently verify if armed groups were using the college compound for military purposes.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Chad', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Russia', 'Bangladesh', 'Geneva', 'Sorman', 'Turkey', 'Jordan', 'Egypt', 'China', 'Kazakhstan']",UAE unlawful Libya drone strike kills 8 civilians: HRW report,https://www.libyaherald.com/2020/04/30/uae-unlawful-libya-drone-strike-kills-8-civilians-hrw-report/,None,
11398624,2020-02-28,"As part of its ongoing improved transparency and governance programme, Libya's main sovereign wealth fund, the Libya Investment Authority (LIA) published its first ever self-assessment of their application of the Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (the Santiago Principles), the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) reported yesterday.

The IFSWF describes itself as a voluntary organisation of global sovereign wealth funds committed to promoting good governance and investment management practices through dialogue, research and self-assessment. It says it also seeks to promote a deeper understanding of sovereign wealth fund activity amongst government and financial services institutions.

Yesterday, the IFSWF published all 34 full members' self-assessments of their application of the Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (the Santiago Principles). It reported that these documents provide new details into the governance structures, as well as investment and risk management processes and practices of these institutions.

It said that this was the first time that all IFSWF members have completed and published a self-assessment, including the LIA.

It will be recalled that the Santiago Principles were written by a group of 26 sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in 2008 to define a practical and appropriate governance and accountability framework for sovereign wealth funds. All members of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds voluntarily endorse and apply the Principles.

IFSWF says that the publication of the self-assessments is accompanied by an independent analysis by the Fletcher School at Tufts University, which compares the previous self-assessments, published in 2017, and the revised documents, both of which are available on the IFSWF website.

This analysis, it says, reveals that over the past three years, the overall quality of members' disclosures via the self-assessments has, in its assessment, improved measurably, indicating a greater commitment to regular review of the implementation of the Santiago Principles.

It adds that the comparative analysis also suggests that greater IFSWF member engagement in the self-assessment process contributes meaningfully to clearer and more consistent member disclosure.

It will be recalled that the LIA is attempting to persuade the UN Security Council to ease its freeze on its assets abroad at least to the extend that it can prevent them from losing value.

It recently revealed its 2020 reform programme including best practice and better management and transparency. In October 2019 it appointed Oliver Wyman as consultants. In August 2019 it had announced that it had amended its articles of association and those of its companies to prevent conflict of interest through management holding more than one leading role.

The agreement was signed on the side lines of the Second Libyan Real Estate Development Forum held in Tunis 5-6 February.

The agreement came in response to the recommendations of the First Libyan Real Estate Development Forum held in Tunis in October 2018 in the context of strengthening the private public partnership in the sector. The agreement accepts the new reality of post Qaddafi Libya whereby the state contractually owns most of the huge multi-billion dollar stalled real estate projects - but has no finances to compete them. Including and allowing the private sector - the only sector capable of driving Libya's economy forward in the long term - through its capital will also help release Libya's economy.

The agreement is expected to contribute to the injection of hundreds of millions of dinars of private sector funds for real estate development.

Tadawul Real Estate Fund reports that it is licensed to issue investment certificates to companies and individuals worth a quarter of a billion Libyan dinars to be issued through Libya's Stock Market to develop real estate projects outside the state budget.

Tadawul also reports that it is the first private fund to be licensed by the Central Bank of Libya and the Libyan Stock Exchange.

Commenting on the agreement, Naaman Elbouri, Board Member of Tadawul Real Estate, said that ''The real estate sector in any developing country accounts for approximately 60-65% of GDP and the largest employer of manpower.

Today we can more than double Libya's revenues from oil through real estate development. We just need urban plans, the reactivating the of the land registry, the activation of the Finance Leasing law and the repeal of (the Qaddafi era) Law No. 4 (where tenants became overnight owners) and the repeal of law of 1/2013.

Elbouri added that ''There are 100 billion Libyan dinars sitting in Libyan banks and I have people looking for investment opportunities and they can contribute to the creation of an urban revolution in Libya. Investment comes through moving the wheel of the economy''.

11398626,2020-01-28,"The dominant call by all participants at the Berlin Libya conference on 19 January addressed to all parties at war in Libya were, in order of importance; ""fair and equitable distribution of oil revenues"", ""implementing the UN Arms Embargo"" and "" stop using foreign mercenaries"".

All Participants expressed fear and reservation that the Libyan War may generate the potential regrouping of Terror Groups threatening neighbouring nations and massive migration to Europe.

The world leaders convened in Berlin agreed that the true mover of the war in Libya is primarily economic in nature and driven mostly by the cost of money to the various players; the Libyan dinar versus the U.S. dollar (LD v US$). Many leaders and participants misrepresented the call as ""distribution of wealth"" and there was lesser talk about ""fighting terror"".

Terror and migration becoming more of a potential outcome of the war rather than the motive of the ongoing war per se.

In my opinion and in my analysis, the Libyan war is definitely not about the distribution of wealth. Libya is a rentier state, where the 85 percent of the National Budget is allocated to the wages of public servants (1.8 million civil servants + 500 thousand employees of Government Companies and 200 thousand Socially Assisted Citizens giving a total of 2.5 million state-sector salaries in a nation of 7.5 Libyan citizens). In addition to this there is the state subsidies of energy and fuels - which is the cheapest in the world!

The war is definitely about monetary wealth management and the cost of money. A war that can best be described as ""LD vs USD multiple rates"".

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) and Libyan and foreign oil companies have joggled and skilfully managed to maintain Libya's oil and gas flowing through a semblance of neutrality to generate revenues of over US$ 22 billion annually ,maintain foreign CBL reserves at above US$ 85 billion in addition to over US$ 15 billion of Libya Investment Authority (LIA) deposits. These total at over US$ 100 billion.

On the 17 of January the unexpected became a reality. Two days prior to the international Berlin conference on Libya called by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and attended by the UN Secretary General , Presidents , Prime Ministers and a US Secretaries of State, the Libyan Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG), whose job is to keep Libya's oil flowing , ordered the stoppage of the oil flow within Libya's eastern oil Crescent and oil ports bringing production down from 1.2 million barrels per day to less than 250,000 barrels p/d.

Despite this and the breaking on multiple occasions of the verbally declared stoppage of warfare, most Libyans had and still have high hopes. Wishes and faith for a UN resolution calling for ceasefire and adopting the recommendations of the Berlin Conference.

All are hopeful of a permanent ceasefire, a return of all internally displaced persons and the return of the parties to the political process under the auspices of the UN as was officially supported by four Permanent Members of the Security Council and all other attendees in the persons of UN Secretary General, Presidents, Prime Ministers and Ambassadors.

What about the ""LDs Vs USD"" war?

Each of the two opposing parties in the Libyan dispute brands itself as the rightful army while labelling the opposing fighters as renegades (militias, warlords, criminals and or terrorist). The NOC, meanwhile, is caught in between the two and maintaining a declared neutrality produces the oil, sells and collects all revenues which it deposits into an account which it does not manage - but is managed by the Tripoli-based CBL.

One of the contending parties in the Libyan conflict, the coalition of the eastern-based House of Representatives (HoR), the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army and aligned forces (LNA) and the eastern-based CBL, control most of Libya's oil production that generates the petrodollars feeding the official Tripoli-based CBL accounts. But the eastern coalition has no access to the petrodollars at the official free of Foreign Currency Sale Surcharges at 1.400 LD per US dollar. To have access US dollars, the east is forced to buy it at a minimum cost of 3.650 LD/USD or worse on the Black Market at LD 4.400 per USD - a 300% premium!

The other party in the conflict located in western Libya (the State Council, the Government of National Accord GNA , and the Tripoli CBL) manages Libya's state revenues and considers itself the sole and rightful party permitted to buy the USD at the official government rate of LD 1.400 per USD - less than a third of what it costs the eastern party or coalition.

A letter of exemption from FX surcharges signed by Presidency Council President Faiez Serraj and accepted by Tripoli CBL Governor Saddek El-Kaber can make anyone an overnight millionaire! Whether this is justified or not, this kind of overnight money can turn an angel into a devil and make many devils ask and insist on receiving the same overnight fortune - at the stroke of a pen.

Worse still is the Tripoli CBL's unwavering decision to switch off the Inter CBL clearing system, practically stopping the clearance, access and trading in FX and at any rates for Banks operating in the East of Libya such as Wanha Bank, National Commercial Bank, Credit and Development Bank (representing 35% of National Depositors ). This will soon affect branches of major banks in the West of Libya as customers start to move their operations to branches of banks headquartered there such as Jumhuria, Sahara and other banks.

The closure of the oil flow is in retaliation to the Tripoli CBL closing down the inter-bank clearing process for eastern-headquartered banks. The CBL must reconsider this decision. This step, in my view, must be reversed.

Equally, the FX sales surcharge must be applied by the Tripoli CBL to every transaction to level the field; be it government, public, private, trading or infrastructure. The long-discussed subsidy reform must be implemented with subsidies replaced by cash transfers into individual Libyan's accounts to have an equitable distribution between all and mitigate the corrosive effect of fuel and other types of smuggling of subsidised goods. And finally, the Children's Allowance decreed by law since 2003, but long frozen, must be paid out.

11398627,2020-01-15,"Germany has confirmed that the head of the internationally recognized Libyan government based in Tripoli, Faiez Serraj, and the head of the mainly eastern-based Libyan National Army, Khalifa Hafter, have been invited to the 19 January Berlin conference on Libya.

The USA, Russia, China, France, UK, Italy, Germany, Turkey, UAE, Republic of Congo, Egypt and Algeria, as well as the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union and Arab League - have all been invited.

Congo was invited is because its president, Denis Sassou Nguesso, chairs the African Union's High-Level Committee on Libya. Surprise has been expressed by certain commentators that Libya's neighbour, Tunisia, had not been invited even as an observer.

It will be recalled that Khalifa Hafter, leader of the forces attacking the Libyan capital Tripoli, left Moscow Tuesday without signing a long-term Libya peace deal proposed by Russia and Turkey.

This came after Faiez Serraj had signed the deal on Monday and left Moscow. Hafter had asked to be given time to consider the deal until Tuesday.

The proposed deal came after a ceasefire was agreed on Sunday to halt Hafter's Tripoli attack launched last April.

A series of telephone calls to Tripoli by Libya Herald today confirmed that although there have been further reports of some violations of the ceasefire heard on the outskirts of the capital, residents reported a relative continuation of Sunday's calm.

11398628,2020-01-05,"The United Nations Mission of support in Libya (UNSMIL) condemned in the strongest terms the bombing targeting the Hadba military college South of the capital Tripoli, which resulted in dozens of casualties between dead and wounded.

The internationally recognized government in Tripoli also condemned the attack and declared three days of official mourning. It reported 29 dead and 23 injured. Other Tripoli entities reported both numbers at over 30. Some body parts are reportedly still being collected and hence the figures could rise.

UNSMIL emphasized that the growing escalation of military actions in such a dangerous manner further complicated the situation in Libya and threatened the chances of a return to the political process. It reminded that the continued increase in random bombing on civilians and civilian service facilities such as hospitals, schools and others can amount to war crimes. Adding that war criminals will not get away with punishment for long or short term.

In its condemnation statement, the internationally recognized Presidency Council, led by Faiez Serraj, blamed the attack on ''foreign aircraft supporting the war criminal (Khalifa) Hafter''.

It asked rhetorically: where was the international community ten months into the Tripoli war launched by Hafter, adding that the war had resulted in tens of deaths and thousands of internally displaced. It pledged to respond strongly on the field of battle.

It called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss Hafter's ""war crimes"" at the military academy.

There were scores of people gathered at the blood hospital queuing to donate blood and there were demonstrations condemning the attack in a number of cities, including Tripoli, Misrata and Zawia.

Mitiga airport shut down again yesterday after reopening in the morning. All flights have been redirected to and from Misrata airport again after renewed strikes in its vicinity.

It will be recalled that at a Benghazi session held yesterday, the internationally recognized House of Representatives (HoR), usually based in Tobruk, made a series of decisions following the approval by Turkey's parliament of a bill allowing the Recep Erdogan government to send troops to Libya.

These included: severing relations with Turkey, annulling the recent Libya -Turkish security and military agreement, withdrawing recognition of the (2015 Skhirat) Libyan Political Agreement and its resultant and internationally recognized Tripoli-based government (GNA) led by Faiez Serraj, calling on the international community to likewise withdraw their recognition of the GNA, referring the effective head of the internationally recognized government, Faiez Serraj, his Foreign Minister, Mohamed Siala, his Interior Minister, Fathi Bashagha and ''all those who contributed to bringing colonialism to our country'' to justice on charges of high treason, and authorizing the General Command of the (Khalifa Hafter-led) Armed Forces to disrupt airports, ports and land ports under the control of (Tripoli) militias.

Khalifa Hafter, in a speech yesterday, also called for a holly jihad war against the Turkish forces expected to arrive in Libya in defence of the internationally recognized government,

Comprehensive screening

On Saturday 16 May the NCDC had announced the launch of its comprehensive coronavirus screening starting Sunday. It will be recalled that on 2 May the WHO Libya office urged Libya's health authorities to exercise caution in the face of the serious health threat posed by COVID-19 in the country.

""Now is not the time to reduce caution,"" Elizabeth Hoff, WHO's representative in Libya had said in the statement. ""The low numbers reported should not fool us into a false sense of security. Libya is in the early stages of the epidemic and has not yet reached the height of infection. Until the test becomes more widespread, it will be impossible to ascertain the extent of the disease and its geographical spread.""

WHO went on to recommend that Libya's health authorities increase testing capacity by establishing an additional laboratory in south Libya and expanding testing to include patients with influenza-like illnesses and severe acute respiratory infections.

Hoff had said that while some countries in western Europe are seeing a stabilization or decline in numbers, others are beginning to see a resurgence of cases. Africa, at the beginning of the pandemic, is witnessing an upward trend, she had warned.

In this regard, the aim of Libya's comprehensive screening is to determine the degree of the spread of the Coronavirus and make decisions about the extent of the curfew based on these results, the NCDC explained.

It said that the target groups of the first phase of screening include shelters for displaced persons, shops such as food, vegetables and fruits, bakeries, petrol stations, butchers, as well as conducting community surveys of families living in each home within the target municipality.

The first phase of the comprehensive medical survey was launched on Sunday in the municipalities of Busleem, Ain Zara, Sug Il Juma and Tajura. The rest of the municipalities will be screened in the second phase of the campaign. The south of Libya will also be screened, the NCDC said.

Libya sends doctors to Italy to help with Coronavirus

On Sunday, Libya dispatched 6 Libyan doctors from Tripoli's Mitiga airport to Italy to provide medical assistance to Italy in response to the Corona pandemic. The NCDC said this was because Italy is the country most affected by the COFD-19 outbreak in the world.

It said that this step comes in coordination between the Ministries of Health and Foreign Affairs and the NCDC as a humanitarian response and medical assistance to the Italian state, as well as Libyan doctors gaining practical experience in dealing with Covid-19 infected patients.

The Ministry said that the new shipping line is part of its preparations for the new fresh and seasonal fruit export season and is needed because of the continued closure of Tunisia's land borders with Libya and Algeria preventing the flow of exports as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic.

The journey to Tripoli will last 48 hours and prices will depend on the volume of containers transported. ""Regular container owners (15-16 tonnes) will pay $1,525 (276 millimes/kg), while refrigerated containers (15-16 tonnes) will be transported for $3,350 (607 millimes/kg),"" the ministry said.

The new service had been announced earlier this month by Tunisia's Ministry of Transport. It had said that the move comes as part of ""supporting Tunisian exporters and urging them to seek new markets, facilitate international transfers and develop trade relations between Tunisia and Libya, following measures taken at border crossings to counter the spread of the CORONA virus"".

It will be recalled that 42 percent of Tunisian fruit exports up to August 2019 were destined to Libya.

To underscore the negative effect of the border closure between the two countries on bilateral trade, 180 trucks loaded with Tunisian goods destined for Libya are currently still stranded, after a month, on the border crossing due to anti-Coronavirus measures.

The trucks are loaded mostly with foodstuffs in anticipation of the peak demand month of Ramadan. On 16 April, the Tripoli Chamber of Commerce called on the Libyan government to solve the crisis and held it responsible for any further delays.

11398679,2020-02-18,"European Union and Libya. The concept of relationship between EU and Libya.

The European Union announced yesterday that it will be launching a new Mediterranean operation to monitor the UN Libya arms embargo by the end of March 2020.

The anti-illegal migration operation ''Operation Sophia'' will be terminated on 31 March. However, if illegal migration across the Mediterranean increases, the EU will pull maritime assets away from the new arms embargo operation to counter that. The news was revealed during a press conference yesterday by the EU High Representative and Vice President Josep Borrel.

After briefing media at a press conference on several issues discussed during Monday's European Union's Foreign Affairs Council meeting, High Representative and Vice President Josep Borrel said ''But the most important issue that we have discussed today is Libya. The German Minister [of Foreign Affairs] Heiko Maas debriefed colleagues of the [Foreign Affairs] Council on the outcome of yesterday's follow up meeting on the Berlin process we had on the margins of the Munich Security Conference.

There was a strong call for the arms embargo to be fully respected and implemented. We know that it is not the case. The arms embargo is violated systematically, and it is going to feed the fighters with an incredible amount of arms that make the ceasefire difficult and the truce very weak.

The Ministers agreed that we, as European Union, can play a role and I am happy to announce that after a very long discussion - one of the longest and more intense discussions I can remember -, we managed to reach a political agreement that this morning before starting the [Foreign Affairs] Council I really thought would be impossible. But it is proof that when there is political will, nothing is impossible. Let me go through the main lines of this political agreement that will have to be [made more] concrete at the next Foreign Affairs Council.

We agreed to launch a new operation in the Mediterranean Sea and Operation Sophia will be closed. Operation Sophia reaches its end on the 31 of March and on that day Operation Sophia will finish. We are going to launch a new operation in the Mediterranean. We agreed that this operation will have as a goal the implementation of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council. The operation will comprise aerial, satellite and maritime assets. Not only maritime assets, satellite and aerial, the warships themselves will serve as the basis for the radar control of their space.

The aerial operation will be defined in accordance with the agreed mandate. It means that it is not going to be the same area of operation than the one of [Operation] Sophia. [Operation] Sophia was covering the whole Libyan coast, from one side to the other, from one border to the other border of the country. If we want to control the arms embargo, we have to concentrate our surveillance on the Eastern part, where the arms are coming from and a strategic situation with respect to the routes followed by the ships bringing arms to Libya. But the military staff will define the area of operation according with this mandate. We agreed that it will maintain other supporting and secondary tasks, including as regards fighting organised crime responsible for migration and also continue training the Libyan Coast Guard and Navy.

We have noted legitimate concerns of some Member States regarding potential impact on migration flows - the so-called pull effect -, and indicated that this will be monitored carefully and reported on regularly by the Operation Commander.

On this basis, in case of observation of pull factors on migration, maritime assets will be withdrawn from the relevant areas. In case there is a pull effect, and there are different opinions about it, some believe that this pull factor will appear, others believe that on the Eastern part it is not going to happen because the migration routes go from the centre to the West, but let us see what happens. In case that this pull factor appears, maritime assets will be withdrawn from the relevant area.

From here, from today until the next Foreign Affairs Council, the Political and Security Committee and COREPER [Committee of the Permanent Representatives] will develop all the necessary arrangements and details for the implementation of this political agreement. The Member States that need to go through a parliamentarian procedure - this is the case, for example, of Sweden and Germany - will have time to do so.

Now, we have to move speedily to elaborate and adopt a Council Decision along these lines. For sure, subject to national procedures in Member States. This has been agreed by unanimity. That is why I am so satisfied, because really at 9 o'clock in the morning I was not sure that it could be agreed. That is good news and it represents a strong commitment from the European Union to implement the arms embargo.

Media: Does closing Operation Sophia and starting a new one require a new UN mandate or can the mandate of Operation Sophia be reclaimed to enforce the arms embargo?

Josep Borrel: The MANDATE of the United Nations may remain the same. I don't think we need a new mandate.

Media: The vessels in case of 'pull factor' will be moved away from that area, but will remain anyway in the Central Mediterranean area? Have you discussed how to implement the arms embargo on the border between Egypt and Libya?

Josep Borrel: It is very difficult for us to act on the border between two sovereign countries. We cannot arrive there and say 'Hello the Europeans are coming' to the Egyptians and Libyans. Some Member States have proposed other actions. I am very satisfied by the fact that several Member States have proposed other actions on the ground, which has to be done certainly in agreement with the Libyan authorities. Remember that Libya is a sovereign country. We cannot disembark there saying 'I am going to do whatever'. For the time being it was quite difficult and we had enough on getting an agreement on the new operation. We will leave this for the next Foreign Affairs Council.

About the withdrawal of the warships, the text says that they will be withdrawn from the relevant area, which means - as I understand it - as the areas where the 'pull factor' has manifested [itself]. It does not mean that it will have to be withdrawn from other areas.

Media. A question about the famous pull factor is an effect that has never been demonstrated before. You yourself said that by the time Operation Sophia was present at sea, attempts to cross had decreased. In a way, does it not confirm the opposite, that there is indeed a risk of pull factor?

Josep Borrel: We have discussed this a lot, there are different opinions. I personally think that there have been none and that there would be difficult but each has its own interpretations.

You know the interpretations are tainted with ideology. Everyone interprets the world according to their ideas, and I prefer to go and see the numbers and the numbers clearly say that during Operation Sophia in the first year the number of migrants continued to increase, perhaps inertially but then it has decreased and it has decreased dramatically, from 150,000 to some 25,000. But everything is interpretable.

The data can be interpreted in one way or another and there are countries that interpret that there is a risk. I think there is no need to discuss whether there is a risk or there is no risk. If the risk arises we will act accordingly, if it does not manifest we will continue.

Media: Can you elaborate on the offer some Member States made for other solutions on the ground to deal with the issues on the Egyptian/Libyan border? On the withdrawal of maritime units, are you not worried that this might reduce the effectiveness of the operation? Because the traffickers might know that as soon as they send out a certain number of boats with migrants you can withdraw all the ships, and then you are not going to have any ships in the waters where they might actually want to smuggle weapons.

Josep Borrel: That is a very sophisticated reasoning. You mean that there would be a concertation between arms traffickers, 'You send some boats with migrants and then the boats of the Europeans will leave'. It may happen, but we have to reach an agreement. Some Member States were not willing to launch this operation because they were afraid of creating a 'pull factor'. Others were willing to take the risk. At the end, we decided as always for a [compromise] solution. We go for it and, if what some are afraid will happen does indeed happen, then we withdraw the ships according to the circumstances and in the relevant areas. If you want to reach an agreement, you have to do some concessions.

Media: If by any chance it happens that the new mission encounters saves some migrants, can they do it, if the meet some of these ships in the Mediterranean, or they just leave them away, and where would they be taken in case they could save them? Do you consider this decision, the fact that Sophia is finished, do you consider it as a defeat or victory for the European Union?

Josep Borrel: Operation Sophia worked very well, to my understanding, when it was operational. Today Operation Sophia is still alive, theoretically, but without ships, only with aerial means. By the end of March we will arrive to the end of the term. If we launch a new operation and we do not want to create a 'pull effect', I do not think it is necessary to have two operations. In any case several Member States were very much insisting on the fact that we cannot have two different naval operations. Of course international law remains international law and the law of the sea remains the law of the sea. If a ship encounters people who are drowning then we have to save them. [As to where they would be taken to], this is something that will have to be discussed. We cannot say 'You found someone? Do not help them'. That is impossible. It is against any principle of humanitarian and international law.

Media: You have said that the warships will serve as a radar basis for aerial surveillance but what will happen if they actually encounter a ship that is suspected of delivering weapons or troops? Will they be able to stop the ship?

Josep Borrel: For sure. They are not just having a promenade.

Media: Will any of the naval assets operate in Libyan waters? Who will make the decision as to where the 'pull factor' has been big enough to withdraw a ship from that area? Will it be the commander or will it be the Foreign Affairs Council? And how long will it take? Your argument before was to keep the same mission because otherwise it would take a lot of time to create a new one?

Josep Borrel: The question about the successor of Operation Sophia - we have to look for a name of the new operation. On Libyan waters, you know there is a military staff. We are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, we are not specialists on this kind of issues. The General [Claudio] Graziano [The Chairman of the European Union Military Committee], who is the head of the military staff - who advises me and advises the Council on military issues - was there. He explained clearly that there is no other alternative in order to implement the arms embargo than having ships in the water. Which waters? This will depend on the intelligence about the routes followed by the ships bringing arms. They are not going blindly by the sea, they will have an intelligence behind them. They will have information and they will be strategically placed where the ships bringing arms to Libya can pass by.

Media: Who will make the decision on whether the 'pull factor' has been big enough to withdraw and how long will this take to set-up?

Josep Borrel: We have not gone into these details, but I suppose it would be done by the Council under the advice of the military committee. It is the military committee that has to tell us 'look, the figures, the numbers of migrants intercepted is picking up'. 1 would not be enough and 100 000 would be too much. In the middle, there is a wide range of situations. The military staff will tell us and the Council will take the decision.

Media: Are there any proposal for how large this force will be and who will provide the assets? You are aware of the doubts there are about the effectiveness of a naval operation because of the quantity of arms coming by land and air. What would you say to that scepticism and what percentage of weapons do you estimate come by sea to Libya?

Josep Borrel: We do what we can. It is clear that we cannot deploy army troops on the ground on the border between Libya and Egypt. It is clear that we cannot do that. But an important part of the traffic of arms goes by sea from the eastern part of Libya. The military advisers have been telling us, to the Ministers that one important thing is to use the radars on board of the ships in order to control the air traffic, to know where are the planes coming from and what kind of planes they are. This will give important information about the traffic of arms.

Media: What about the proposals on how big this force will be and which countries will provide assets?

Josep Borrel: A lot of countries are volunteering. I do not think we are going to be in a shortage of resources. Once again it is the military who have to say if they need two, three or five [warships]. We have not gone into these details.

Media: When do you expect these warships to be deployed? Do you have a timeframe? And just to confirm what you said before about the ships not being there for a promenade, next time that Turkey sends militias or Russia send mercenaries to this area, Commanders of for example German frigates will engage, even if they have to deal with Russian or Turkish nationals? These would be the rules of engagement?

Josep Borrel: The rules of engagement have to be proposed by the military Command. The rules of engagement will have to be proposed by the professionals of these kind of issues, which are not easy to deal with. Today we have put on the table a political agreement. We are going to send navy ships in order to control the routes followed by the ships that bring arms to Libya. For sure, they are not there to just have a look and say ""hello"". No, they have to act. If there is traffic of arms, they will have to react and interfere the movement of the ships. On which basis? Under which rules of engagement? There are specialists of the navy who will tell us how to follow it.

About the timing, if we are able to approve the specific and concrete items of the mission on the next Foreign Affairs Council - which I hope -, then it can be launched immediately after.

The partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Libya and the Government of Germany, aimed at working together with national stakeholders towards peace, stabilization and development in Libya was strengthened last week.

His Excellency, the German Ambassador to Libya, Mr. Oliver Owcza, and UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Gerardo Noto, signed an agreement by which Germany committed Euro 2,020,000 (US$ 2,382,250) to support the Political Dialogue Programme, which has organized the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), currently being held in Tunis, under the leadership of Acting SRSG Stephanie Williams and facilitated by the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) in partnership with UNDP.

Within the framework of the ""Berlin Process"", and following the recent permanent nationwide ceasefire signed by the 5+5 Joint Military Commission in Geneva, 75 Libyans from all constituencies, including youth, women and all regions, representing the social and political spectrum of Libyan society, are participating in the LPDF to discuss a political roadmap to achieve lasting peace in the country after many years of conflict.

The new funding provided by Germany will support the organization of the LPDF in Tunis and future activities in support of the intra-Libyan Dialogue, as outlined in the Berlin Conclusions, endorsed by the Security Council resolution 2510.

During the signing ceremony, Acting SRSG Stephanie Williams affirmed: ""I would like to thank the Government of Germany for its generous contribution in support of the peace process in Libya. Significant milestones have been reached toward a roadmap for the preparatory phase of a comprehensive solution to end the country's transition. This critical boost in funding will help continue our support for the LPDF as well as the intra-Libyan talks on the military, economic and international humanitarian and human rights law tracks.""

Ambassador Owcza stated: ""We are proud to contribute to the ongoing Libyan Political Talks LPDF in Tunis. Germany is committed in it´s support to the Libyan Political and Peace Process as a core follow-up of the Berlin Conference. We encourage all LPDF participants to work towards an comprehensive and consensual agreement. As we call on all Libyan stakeholders to support the upcoming transitional phase to the benefit of all Libyans. We commend the Tunisian government for its political support and hospitality under logistically challenging conditions. We express gratitude and appreciation for the leadership and teams of UNSMIL and UNDP in facilitating this event.""

On his part, Resident Representative Mr. Noto said: ""Germany strong partnership with UNDP in Libya has been very effective in providing support to people in Libya for peace, stabilization and building democratic public institutions. This strong support to political dialogue made possible the organization of this critical meeting of the LPDF, led by Acting SRSG Stephanie Williams and UNSMIL with UNDP support. We are looking forward to continue working together for governance, inclusive development and peace for all in Libya"".

Germany is a key contributor to UNDP Libya initiatives being the main contributor to the Stabilization Facility for Libya (SFL) with more than $32,000,000 of funds.

The Government of the United States of America, through the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance has approved additional funding of US$ 2 million toward UNICEF's multi-sectoral preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya, which aims to contribute to the reduction of human-to-human transmission and to mitigating the impact of the pandemic on children, adolescents and youth, and their parents. UNICEF's interventions target the most vulnerable populations, including migrants, refugees, returnees, internally displaced persons, and conflict-affected host communities, focusing on those most affected by COVID-19 in the south and other areas in the country.

The assistance received will specifically support the strengthening of risk communication and community engagement in affected and vulnerable geographical areas, facilitate access to community-based child protection services, including specialized recovery services, provide a socio-economic response through multi-purpose cash transfers, and contribute to a monitoring mechanism tracking socioeconomic indicators of children and families in Libya.

With the generous funds received from the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, approximately one million people, including frontline healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, paramedics, cleaners), teachers, and key business owners and service providers will benefit from the project. Furthermore, 7,000 girls, boys, and women will be reached with child protection services, 300,000 children, parents, caregivers and community officials will be reached with awareness raising initiatives. Some 300 social workers and partners will receive capacity building and training, and 200 vulnerable children and their families will benefit from multi-purpose cash transfers.

11398713,2020-05-23,"Acting SRSG Stephanie Williams Briefing to the Security Council- 19 May 2020

Let me open with best wishes to our Muslim colleagues on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan. Allow me also to congratulate Estonia for its Presidency of the Security Council this month.

Mr. President,

I had hoped to be able to deliver a more positive report to you today but unfortunately, just when we think that the bottom has been reached in Libya, we somehow manage to achieve new depths of violence, heartlessness, and impunity. Despite our determined efforts and the Secretary-General's plea for an immediate ceasefire to allow Libyans to respond to the common threat of COVID-19, I regret to report that there has been no lull in the fighting between the Government of National Accord (GNA) forces and General Haftar's ""Libyan National Army,"" also known as the ""Libyan Arab Armed Forces"" (LAAF.) Instead, fighting has escalated with an unprecedented increase in indirect fire in urban areas and a growing tide of suffering for civilians.

For nearly 15 months following the launch of General Haftar's attack on Tripoli in April of 2019, armed conflict has been raging in and around some of Libya's most densely populated areas. As a result of the intensifying armed hostilities, coupled with the dire socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and including the loss of employment and livelihoods, a million people are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. This includes 400,000 internally displaced Libyans, along with 654,000 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. In the last one year alone, since the attack on Tripoli started, 201,000 Libyans were forced to flee their homes, mostly in and around the capital.

While people around the world are adjusting to the new normal of living with a global pandemic, millions of Libyans - most notably the two million residents of Tripoli - are experiencing a most abnormal and terrifying existence, under almost constant bombardment, frequent water and electricity cuts and compounded by restricted movement as a result of preventive COVID-19 measures, rendering the whole situation unbearable for the majority to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan in peace. We continue to witness an alarming military build-up as a result of the uninterrupted dispatch by the foreign backers of increasingly sophisticated and lethal weapons, not to mention the recruitment of more mercenaries to both sides of the conflict.

After their successful bid to retake six cities on the coastal road west of Tripoli in April, GNA forces are now seeking to roll back the LNA's foothold in southern Tripoli by forcing the redeployment of resources and disrupting their supply lines from the nearby city of Tarhouna. Emboldened by these recent successes, the GNA showed reluctance to reciprocate a unilaterally declared cessation of all military activities announced by the LNA on 29 April on the occasion of Ramadan. On 5 May, GNA forces initiated operations to seize control of the Wutiya airbase but were initially repelled by UAVs and snipers, resulting in dozens of fatalities. After repeated attempts, supported by multiple airstrikes conducted by drones, GNA forces took control of the airbase yesterday, on 18 May. The control of this strategic airbase may trigger further escalation, turning the Libyan conflict into a pure proxy war. As has been the case on a number of occasions, we witnessed the direct involvement of foreign parties in this operation, either with UAVs or the presence on the ground of air defence systems, in blatant violation of the arms embargo.

Since 24 April, Tripoli, and in particular Mitiga airport, has been subjected to nearly non-stop daily shelling. On 7 May, heavy-artillery bombardment and grad rocket attacks launched by pro-LNA forces impacted downtown Tripoli, including the seaport and in the vicinity of the Foreign Ministry, the Turkish embassy and the residence of Italy's ambassador to Libya, with at least two civilians killed and three others injured. Another round of shelling on targets in and around Mitiga by General Haftar's forces on 15 May hit three warehouses of the Central Committee for Municipal Elections, destroying a sizable amount of electoral material. Once again, we call for the immediate cessation of attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure whilst calling on the GNA to restore the civilian nature of Mitiga airport.

Military operations in and around Tarhouna caused new displacement and negatively impacted humanitarian access to the city. I am concerned about GNA UAV attacks over the past two months on vehicles travelling between Mazdah and Tarhouna as well as in Bani Walid which caused collateral damage to vehicles carrying non-combat related items like food, goods, and fuel and resulted in civilian casualties.

Since my last briefing, the al Khadra Hospital which was assigned to receive patients infected with COVID-19, was hit on four separate days by LNA rockets, along with the Royal Hospital, the Field Medical Support Centre in Tariq al-Matar, and the Weryemma polyclinic, causing the facilities to be evacuated. On 16 May, shelling carried out by General Haftar's forces struck a shelter for internally displaced persons and migrants in Tripoli's al-Furnaj district. At least seven persons were killed and 17 injured, including women and children. This is not the first time this camp has been targeted. On 10 May, an armed group opened fire inside the intensive care unit in al-Jalla hospital in Benghazi, damaging equipment, while the Tripoli Central Hospital sustained damage as a result of LNA rocket attacks, launched by pro-LNA forces. I would be remiss not to reiterate that such attacks violate International Humanitarian Law and may amount to war crimes.

Between 1 April and 18 May, UNSMIL documented at least 248 civilian casualties (58 killed and 190 injured), an 89 per cent increase compared to the total civilian casualties recorded for the first three months of this year. The vast majority of the total civilian casualties are attributed to forces affiliated to the LNA. Those guilty of crimes under international law must be brought to justice.

We are also concerned by attacks on civilians, desecration of corpses, retribution, including looting, robberies and torching of public and private properties, in western coastal towns recently seized by GNA forces. On 14 April, following the GNA forces' takeover of the city of Surman, the Martyr Othman Hamza Company, affiliated with the GNA, broke into Surman prison and unlawfully released 401 prisoners. In Tarhouna, on 5 April, the LNA-affiliated armed group 9th Brigade killed at least nine civilians and demolished seven houses, after forcibly evicting families from their homes and abducting seven women, whose fate remains unknown.

Social media is another theatre of the Libyan conflict. Building on the workshops we ran last year to stem incitement and the use of hateful rhetoric in the media, UNSMIL organized a virtual forum in April with nearly 30 prominent Libyan traditional and social media figures from across the spectrum. We were pleased to see the participants agree to establish a hate speech observatory under the auspices of UNSMIL and to produce a Code of Ethics.

Mr. President,

COVID-19 compounds existing insecurity in addition to exacerbating longstanding vulnerabilities. The UN System is hard at work to assist national authorities, including through the provision of supplies, equipment, and training. Testing capacity has been scaled up. There are now five operational laboratories in the country, up from two, but more are needed, including the qualified personnel to operate them.

As of 18 May, there were 65 confirmed cases, including three COVID-related deaths that were reported across Libya. According to WHO, the peak has not yet reached Libya and the risk of an intensification of the outbreak remains very high. It should also be noted that the low count of positive cases is proportional to the low testing capacity, contact tracing in the country, and fear of social stigmatization.

Although national authorities have provided frequent updates on financial pledges to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including on the purchase of medical equipment and the payment of salaries to medical workers, these have been slow to materialize and salaries to be fully paid. Local authorities across Libya face severe shortages of functioning hospitals, intensive care units, vital medical equipment, and supplies including personal protective equipment. According to a recent WHO survey, while 75 percent of primary health centres are open, only 20 per cent are delivering services.

Likewise, humanitarian actors face access constraints in moving humanitarian supplies into and around the country, and flights carrying medical supplies have not been able to land due to a lack of clearances in Benghazi. Negotiating clearances to operate during curfews due to COVID-19, as well as ongoing insecurity, have delayed relief distributions.

To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and in response to advocacy from UNSMIL, I welcome the reported release by Libyan authorities of more than 2,000 prisoners and detainees between 25 March and 15 May. The Supreme Judicial Council, the Public Prosecution, and the Ministry of Justice demonstrated desire to protect prisoners and detainees from COVID-19 and we encourage them to release further prisoners particularly women and children, persons with disabilities, persons with medical conditions, older persons, migrants and refugees. With technical support and equipment provided by the United Nations, al-Jadideh Prison in Tripoli hosted several successful remote court-hearings between 15 and 30 April.

We remain very concerned about the situation of migrants and asylum seekers in Libya. Since January, more than 3,200 have been intercepted at sea and returned to Libya frequently to abusive conditions in detention, whilst others have disappeared altogether. UNSMIL is also concerned about the expulsions of at least 1,400 migrants and refugees this year from eastern Libya in violation of Libya's international human rights law obligations on non-refoulement and collective expulsions, and the risk that more may soon be forcibly deported. We have received reports of the failure to assist and coordinated pushbacks of migrant boats in the central Mediterranean, which continues to be one of the deadliest migration routes in the world. Both Italy and Malta (and now Libya as well) have closed their ports to disembarkation of migrants rescued at sea, citing health concerns related to COVID-19. The stabilization of populations in Libya will only come, first and foremost, through an immediate ceasefire followed by a full return to political dialogue.

I would like to urge Member States to respond to our call for COVID-dedicated funding as well as to ramp up support to the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan, which is seriously underfunded at 14 per cent. The lack of funding is hampering our ability to combat the pandemic as well as to ensure that existing vulnerabilities are not exacerbated.

Mr. President,

There is a risk that violence may expand in southern Libya as the conflict sharpens existing divisions. In the southern city of Sabha, the recently sworn-in elected municipal council was suspended after it made a statement supportive of the LNA on 26 April leading the GNA Ministry of Local Governance to replace it with an appointed Steering Committee. The elected council has filed an appeal of the GNA's decision. I encourage the Government to engage in a constructive dialogue with the elected council in order to safeguard democratic processes in Libya. Municipal service delivery should be shielded from national politics.

We commend the perseverance of Libya's local electoral committee officials who continue preparations to resume municipal council elections despite tremendous challenges. Another 38 local elections are planned to be held in 2020; municipal councils and the CCMCE are considering special measures to provide a safe environment for voting during the pandemic. Elections are planned in several municipalities in June and July, including in Misrata.

Excellencies,

The fighting, compounded with COVID-19 and the on-going oil blockade, pose an unprecedented challenge to the already fraught socio-economic situation in Libya. The blockade itself has already cost Libya over USD four billion. With a looming budget deficit of 26 billion dinars in 2020, the Central Bank of Libya has imposed austerity measures including limits on foreign exchange. All of this has led to a loss of income, food shortages and price spikes, including supply chain disruptions. The parallel market exchange rate has increased from 4.1 LYD to the US dollar in January to 6.1 today, which further impacts people's purchasing power. Many of the gains from the economic reforms enacted in 2018 have been erased.

I have engaged both the Prime Minister and the Central Bank Governor to address the country's financial crisis and encourage dialogue with the aim of implementing a series of reforms which will mitigate both the national deficit and improve the lives of the average Libyan. This month the Ministry of Justice delivered an encouraging ruling on the legality of the international audit.

Another worrying trend is the weaponization of vital services. Since the end of March there have been four incidents, two that cut water supplies from the Man-Made River and two that have cut natural gas supplies to electrical power plants. These acts are reprehensible at any time but particularly at a time when the country is suffering from the effects of war and a global pandemic.

In a positive development, on 3 May the National Oil Corporation (NOC) managed to restore the institutional integrity of the national fuel distribution company, Brega, by reunifying the Management Committee. We welcome this development as it maintains the impartiality and effectiveness of the NOC.

Mr. President,

I assure you that the United Nations will not relent in our effort to get Libya's political and military leaders to assume their responsibilities and commit to a ceasefire and a political settlement. In the wake of recent military developments, it appears there may be a window for the rejuvenation of some political activity.

On 23 April, House of Representatives President Saleh announced a new political initiative, calling for the social and political constituencies representing the East, the West and the South to elect their own representatives to a three-member Presidency Council under the supervision of the UN. By contrast, on the same day, General Haftar regrettably reiterated that he considers the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) and the current Presidency Council void and requested that Libyans choose an institution to lead the country for a transitional period. In a follow-up speech just four days later on 27 April, General Haftar ""accepted"" what he believes is a popular mandate for his General Command to play a greater governance role. On a more positive note, on 5 May, Prime Minister Serraj publicly welcomed all political initiatives that called for a peaceful solution to the Libyan crisis and urged all parties to resume political talks either within the framework of the LPA or via an agreement to hold elections under an agreed constitutional framework. Should the talks be held within the LPA framework, Mr. Serraj referred to the restructuring of the executive, including formation of a Presidency Council (PC) with three members, and a government headed by a prime minister.

We welcome the constructive stance taken by the Prime Minister and the HoR President and any political initiatives that are inclusive and aimed at ending the fighting and finding a peaceful solution to the conflict within the framework of the conclusions of the 19 January International Conference in Berlin and UNSCR 2510. Our mission remains to help Libyans rebuild a state strong enough to peacefully contain political differences.

We have engaged with the GNA and the LNA to build on the draft ceasefire agreement tabled at the 23 February 5+5 Joint Military Commission talks in Geneva. The Mission is analyzing comments on the draft agreement provided by the GNA team. We are still waiting to receive feedback from the LNA. I request your assistance to ensure that we receive a response at the earliest to resume these much-needed exchanges. The existing draft constitutes the most solid basis for a resumption of the discussion.

We appreciate the support expressed by participants to the Berlin Conference. In the same spirit, we hope to count on their backing to urgently stop the inflow of military support from abroad in violation of the UN arms embargo. The European Union launched a new Operation Irini on 1 April. We welcome all efforts to support the implementation of the UN arms embargo, in line with Security Council resolution 2292 (2016) and encourage Member States to contribute to its monitoring and implementation in a comprehensive manner.

We equally appreciate the interest of Member States and our Libya Quartet partner organizations to engage within the International Follow-Up Committee on Libya, which convened at the senior officials' level on 2 April and 13 May. The raison d'être of the Committee is to ensure implementation of the Berlin commitments. Discussions have begun in the four thematic working groups established under the Committee. The groups form a critical tool to support UNSMIL, but also to demonstrate to the Libyans that the Berlin Conference can deliver on its promises.

Mr. President,

As we survey the carnage wrought by almost 15 months of unrelenting violence in Libya, I believe we have a reached another turning point in the conflict. From what we are witnessing in terms of the massive influx of weaponry, equipment and mercenaries to the two sides, the only conclusion that we can draw is that this war will intensify, broaden and deepen with devastating consequences for the Libyan people. As the foreign intervention increases, the Libyans themselves are getting lost in the mix, their voices crowded out. We must not let Libya slip away. We must enable responsible Libyans to write their own future. By coming together now, this Council can ensure the collective security it is mandated to maintain by applying consistent and credible pressure on those regional and international actors that are fueling the conflict. We can collectively write a different ending to this so far sad tale but only if we demonstrate a collective will to do so.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Tarhuna', 'Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Italy', 'Estonia', 'Bani Walid', 'Turkey', 'Brega', 'Misrata', 'Malta', 'Berlin', 'Geneva']",Williams Briefing to the Security Council- 19 May 2020,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/05/21/williams-briefing-to-the-security-council-19-may-2020/,None,

U.S. Ambassador to Libya Richard Norland held a conversation with Libya's Minister of Planning Taher Al-Jehaimi on April 28 to discuss Libya's COVID-19 response and the United States' ongoing commitment to help Libya through the pandemic.

There is currently a Memorandum of Intent (MOI) between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Government of Libya, through the Ministry of Planning, which provides the framework for bilateral cooperation to strengthen Libya's governance institutions; increase opportunities for economic participation and growth; and enhance Libya's ability to address instability and conflict.

In light of the United States' recent announcement of an additional $6 million USD in COVID-19 assistance for Libya, Minister Al-Jehaimi expressed his commitment to the accountability systems currently in place to ensure that U.S. assistance goes to people in need in communities across Libya. The Ambassador and the Minister also discussed the importance of ensuring that Libya's financial institutions work effectively in tandem to address the challenges posed across the country by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The additional $6 million USD contribution from the United States will provide technical assistance on infection prevention and control, support water and sanitation in selected health facilities, develop risk communication materials, and support community engagement activities that will benefit Libyans throughout the country.

Ambassador Norland emphasized that immediate efforts to respond to the COVID-19 crisis complement the United States' prior investments in Libya over many years towards building the capacity of national- and local-level Libyan institutions, and that the U.S. will continue to stand firmly with the Libyan people.

U.S. Investments in Libya - Public Health and Development

Since 2011, the United States has invested more than $715 million in Libya's public health and overall development, including in emergency health programs to help keep people healthy and stave off disease.

This assistance has supported the capabilities of many of the national and local institutions and organizations that are now leading the COVID-19 response. The United States is coordinating with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Local Government (MOLG) to improve the quality and availability of municipal primary health services to help ensure that all Libyans have equal access to reliable health services. In the last year, the United States provided support to equip medical clinics and worked with crisis committees to increase supplies and medical equipment available for local emergency response services.

With support from the United States, the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) launched a national awareness campaign on COVID-19 prevention.

11398767,2020-12-22,"UNDP, Japan, the startup Speetar, and the Ministry of Health launch the first Telemedicine initiative in Libya

A significant proportion of Libya's population do not have access to good quality healthcare, most especially those who live in rural areas.

In an attempt to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus authorities have been forced to impose strict movement restrictions on their constituents. This has prevented people from traveling to clinics, hospitals, and healthcare centers (mostly located in urban areas) in search of suitable healthcare facilities.

However, as part of a coordinated effort to facilitate improved access to healthcare for all people in Libya, and as a successful example of a private-public partnership, The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with support from the Government of Japan, has partnered with a private sector startup company Speetar, and the Ministry of Health to develop the first Telemedicine initiative in Libya.

Telemedicine involves an innovative use of telecommunications technology in the provision of healthcare services to vulnerable populations, especially those who live in hard to reach areas that are far from the healthcare provider.

The use of Telemedicine to ""narrow the gap"" and ""extend the reach"" has recently experienced a rapid growth in many parts of the world as healthcare providers and their patients consistently look for alternative solutions.

Today, in a ceremony organized by the UNDP, the Ministry of Health, and representatives from the private sector partner company (Speetar) launched the Telemedicine Initiative by conducting a live demonstration in Tripoli.

At the event, Dr. Khalifa ALBAKOUSH, Head of Scientific Consultancy Committee for COVID-19 from the Ministry of Health, stated:

""During this time of the Pandemic, hospitals and clinics in Libya are afraid to deal with anyone with symptoms, this has created a challenge for people to have the needed medical care. With this initiative, the communication between the doctor and the patient can be done online.

""This will also help the MoH in data collection and analysis. Having an international partner such as UNDP Libya will not only support financially but also technically. We will use the expertise and knowledge they have. I thank UNDP again for not only this initiative, but also for the provision of COVID-19 testing kits and machines"".

On his part, Dr. Almehdi WERMADI, the Minister of Labour, stated:

""We need digital technology, particularly in this time of Covid-19 pandemic. As working in the Labor sector, we need to build the capacity of medical and paramedical staff who are in the frontline of tackling Covid-19. This initiative really supports not only the patients but also young entrepreneurs. ""

On her part, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Libya, Ms. Gozde AVCI-LEGRAND, declared:

""Health is a basic human right. We strongly believe that the Telemedicine initiative has the potential to enhance the Ministry of Health's capacity to extend its provision of e-health services to all the populations in Libya and provide much needed care to all including the most vulnerable populations.""

UNDP Regional Director for Arab States, Ms. Sarah POOLE, participated in the launch. She said:

""This new telemedicine service is an important step in the overall effort by the Government of Libya and partners to ensure more equitable access to health services across Libya, including in rural areas. UNDP is proud to support this initiative, and we thank the Government of Japan for their vital support as well.""

Deputy Head of Mission of the Embassy of Japan in Libya, Mr. Teruyasu SUMISE, said:

""I am proud that the Japanese Government has reliably stepped up to support Libyan in need at such a timely, innovative manner. We are pleased to support the National Network project for Telemedicine to enhance the health system in Libya and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

The Operations Manager of Speetar, Mr. Ahmed ALFITOURI, stated:

""Today we launch the Telemedicine Initiative in Libya, which provides the easiest way to access to health services in Libya, especially in conflict-affected areas and rural cities. In order to use technology huge funds are needed, but also huge technical support in the ground, and that is what UNDP has provided.

It says this analysis follows a recent independent report compiled by Deloitte, which assessed that there has been a significant negative impact on the value of the investments held by the LIA and its subsidiaries as a result of the freezing of its assets under UN sanctions.

At a virtual meeting on Tuesday between the LIA, UNSMIL and the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee, LIA Chairman and Executive Director, Dr Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, reaffirmed Libya's respect for the sanctions regime, noting the fund's full intention to operate within its parameters.

He reiterated that the LIA does not wish to unfreeze the assets, but is merely looking at feasible ways to more actively manage Libya's frozen assets to avoid losses.

According to an LIA statement, the Chairman of the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee, Jurgen Schulz, praised the progress of LIA's transformation programme this year and the alignment of the fund with international best-practice standards.

The cargo left Ecuador and transited through Colombia before being intercepted by Customs in Malta en-route to Libya.

Discrepancies in the scanning image of the cargo lead the Officials to carry out a physical inspection on the container's load. The pallets, carrying the freight, appeared dense compared to regular images and, subsequently, officials offloaded and dismantled one of the pallets.

The inspection lead to the discovery of packets concealed within the pallet's structure, and contained a white substance which gave a positive indication for Cocaine.

A total of 510 packets were elevated, weighing 1.2kg each, for a total of a 612 kg haul. The street value of these narcotics amount to 69 Million Euro.

The case was handed over to the Police Drug Squad for further investigations, while the duty Magistrate was informed about the haul and assigned several court experts to assist. This haul was a record breaker due to the high value and amount from a single container.

To get a better perspective, during 2019 a total of 750kg (84.5 million euro) were intercepted by Customs from 16 containers.

The cost of the conflict in Libya since its outbreak in 2011 exceeds 783 billion Libyan dinars (LYD), i.e. $576 billion according to the official exchange rate (bearing in mind that different rates coexist in the Libyan market).

This is one of the key findings of a new report issued today by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) on the ""Economic Cost of the Libyan Conflict"".

According to the report, the conflict in Libya has drastically shrunk the economy as reflected in the large decline in gross domestic product (GDP) and in investment rates. Consumption has also decreased owing to the massive return of foreign workers to their home countries and reduced incomes of Libyan citizens.

Foreign trade has been disrupted by a significant reduction of exports in some key products such as oil.

The upcoming meeting in Ghadames, near Libya's borders with Tunisia and Algeria, is expected to mark an important milestone towards resolving the Libyan political crisis. So far, the Moroccan peace building initiate has been hailed by all sides as positive for Libya.

On Saturday, more than 120 Libyan deputies in Morocco announced to move forward towards ""ending the division"" in the country, provided that the implementation of the principle will create with a parliamentary session upon return to Libya, according to a final statement.

As part of UNDP's Strengthening Local Capacities for Resilience and Recovery (SLCRRR), the upgrades have been financed by the European Union under the framework of the programme ""Recovery, Stability and Socio-Economic Development in Libya - Baladiyati"".

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) renovated Al-Houria and Al-Tawila schools in Sabratha and handed them over today to the Sabratha Municipal Council in a ceremony that took place at Al-Tawila school.

Al-Tawila School is an elementary and middle school with 600 students located in the west of Sabratha city. The school was built in 1973 and has never been maintained. The one-story building consists of 12 classrooms as well as administration offices, a laboratory and washrooms, and was operating on two shifts - mornings and afternoons. However, the declining state of the school was affecting the learning process for both the students and the 100 teachers and employees who work there. After this renovation, the learning environment and experience for students and teachers alike will improve.

Al-Houria School is an elementary school with originally six classrooms located also in the west of Sabratha city. The 100 students who attended the school were learning in an inadequate environment, which caused health and safety risks for them and the teachers as the center was never maintained. The renovation work included not only maintenance work, but also the addition of four new classrooms, two washrooms, a small office, a principal office, students' affairs and social workers office, chemistry lab room, computer lab, snack room and a school yard. After renovation, the school will be able to host more students who will learn in a suitable environment.

Mayor of Sabratha, Mr. Ramzi Masoud said: ""We thank everyone who extended a helping hand and made these programmes possible. Supporting the ancient city of Sabratha means supporting a world heritage city, one which contains remains of ancient civilizations and one that has made its mark on human history. As people of Sabratha, we are supportive of any efforts that serve the city, whether international or local"".

""Modernizing schools and creating safe learning environments for children are crucial investments in Libya's future,"" said EU Ambassador José Sabadell. ""We are glad that we could complete the important renovation of Al-Tawila and Al-Houria schools in Sabratha despite the additional difficulties posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This project is a crucial part of the European Union's ongoing support to Libyan municipalities in their efforts to improve public services.""

UNDP Resident Representative in Libya, Mr. Gerardo Noto, acknowledged: : ''Through the renovation of the Al-Tawila and Al-Houria schools in Sabratha, and with efforts from all partners, UNDP is moving forward in its commitment to ensuring all boys and girls in Libya have access to quality education in an environment which promotes effective learning outcomes.

The move follows a public disagreement between the two bodies regarding the handling of Libya's oil revenues.

The full statement from the NOC on Monday:

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) has viewed the statement of the Central Bank of Libya issued on 19/11/2020 in which the Central Bank referred to the inaccuracy of the National Oil Corporation's data as the statement claimed, although all the previous monthly statements of the Central Bank clearly confirmed the completion of figures reconciliation processes with the National Oil Corporation which refutes the malicious claim of the Central Bank. However, we would like to clarify the following to the Libyan people:

First, we strongly denounce the fallacies and misleading information mentioned in the statement of the Central Bank of Libya issued on 19 November 2020 regarding the revenues and the expenditure from 01/01/2020 to 31/10/2020 as the actual oil revenues during the period from 01/01/2020 until 31/10/2020 which were deposited in the Central Bank of Libya amounted to (3.7) billion US dollars which is equivalent to (5.2) billion Libyan Dinars according to the official exchange rate and not as mentioned in the Central Bank statement. And when comparing the actual revenues during the period to the estimated revenues according to the financial arrangements which valued at (5.0) billion Libyan Dinars it turns out the achieving of surplus of (200) million Libyan Dinars and not a deficit of (2.6) billion Dinars as mentioned in the Bank statement which perhaps was due to the Bank's not calculating the revenues of January 2020 which amounted to (2.5) billion Libyan Dinars.

The National Oil Corporation also declares that it is about to contract with one of key international companies of financial auditing and verification for its financial and administrative systems.

In the light of the foregoing, we would like to reassure the whole Libyan people of the accuracy of the payment and collection systems and we confirm that the entire revenues of the State of Libya as well as the rights of the foreign partners are accurately documented and held in the National Oil Corporation Account at the Libyan Foreign Bank and the revenues will not be transferred to the account of Central Bank until the Bank has a clear transparency in front of the Libyan people regarding the mechanism of spending the oil revenues during the last years and the entities that benefited from such revenues in the foreign currency which exceeded the total of (186) billion US dollars during the last nine years.

Note that the holding of the revenues in NOC accounts at the Libyan Foreign Bank is a 'temporary' procedure until a comprehensive political settlement is reached of which the most important outcomes shall be the fair use of the revenues among all Libyan cities and towns.

The National Oil Corporation also reaffirms that it has adopted full transparency and disclosure of the revenues to the entire Libyan people on its website since January 2018 and called upon all the Libyan institutions in Libya particularly the Central Bank to do the same in order to ensure the legal and good use of the oil revenues. This oil which NOC and the employees of the oil sector exert strenuous efforts for producing it and sustaining its production. However, the intransigence of the Central Bank and its non-compliance with transparency and disclosure of the State's expenditure have created a suitable atmosphere for the oil blockades and the Central Bank's ambiguous policies were used as pretexts for the blockaders.

And instead of focusing on tackling the challenges of the high prices of the dollar in the parallel markets, stopping the draining of the documentary credits in misleading exchange rates, solving the problem of liquidity and facing the increasing challenges in the banks of the central region, we witness the Bank trying to distract the attention of the public opinion from the basic issues and wrongly and suddenly claim that there were mistakes in reconciliation of the figures with NOC after preventing the Bank from getting hold of the revenues and requiring it to disclose the expenditures of the past years.",Libya Business News,energy,,['Libya'],NOC to Withhold Oil Revenue from Central Bank,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/11/24/noc-to-withhold-oil-revenue-from-central-bank/,None,

In the presence of Acting SRSG Stephanie Williams during the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) held in Tunis under her leadership and facilitated by the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), the Deputy General Director/Central Director for the Mediterranean and Middle East countries of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Luca Gori, and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative, Mr. Gerardo Noto, signed an agreement by which Italy provides an initial contribution euro 450,000 (US$ 526,000) to UNDP's Political Dialogue Programme.

Within this programme, UNDP has provided operational support to the UNSMIL-facilitated intra-Libyan talks, based on Security Council resolution 2510 (2020) endorsing the Conclusions of the Berlin Conference on Libya. These included recent talks by the 5+5 Joint Military Commission, leading to the signing of a recent permanent nationwide ceasefire s in Geneva on 23 October.

During the signing ceremony, Acting SRSG Stephanie Williams stated:

""I strongly welcome Italy's steadfast and longstanding support to the UN efforts in Libya. This contribution has enabled UNSMIL, with the support of UNDP, to convene the first round of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum from 9-15 November 2020.""

On his part, Director Gori, declared:

""The stabilization of Libya is a strategic priority for Italy. Since the beginning of the crisis, we have been advocating that the only way to ensure Libya's stability, unity and integrity was to pursue political dialogue, in the framework of the UN-led Berlin Process. Indeed, we are fully engaged in achieving these objectives in close cooperation with UNSMIL and UNDP whose efforts in favor of the political solution of the Libyan crisis remain essential"".

Resident Representative Mr. Noto said:

""UNDP and Italy have a very strong partnership working on strategic initiatives to support people in Libya. Today we are thankful for the renewed effort to support the UN peacebuilding under the Berlin Process with this contribution to the political dialogue project to organize the LPDF and other intra-Libyan dialogues. Italy also partner with UNDP to support national and local elections, policing and security and other areas of governance and institution building.

""Italy is a key partner of the stabilization facility contributing to recover communities and benefit people affected by conflict all around the country. We are looking forward to continue working together for peace and inclusive development in Libya.""

11398799,2020-11-23,"Remarks by Acting Special Representative of the Un Secretary-General Stephanie Williams to the Security Council - 19 November 2020:

Madam President, Ambassador King (St. Vincent and the Grenadines), Excellencies,

Since my last briefing on 2 September, we have made substantial progress in the search for peace and stability in Libya. After many years of oppression, division, chaos, misery, and conflict, Libyans are coming together, for the sake of Libya, for the sake of their children and grandchildren, to chart a Libyan vision for the way forward that has the opportunity to preserve the country's unity and reassert its sovereignty.

As the de facto truce on the ground continued to hold, UNSMIL, with your support and the support of the Berlin group, facilitated open dialogue to build stability, security and national unity among the Libyan parties. These efforts resulted first in the signature of a countrywide, permanent, ceasefire agreement in Geneva on 23 October to start with immediate effect. There, the 10 military officers comprising the 5+5 Joint Military Commission set their differences aside and, guided by their patriotic spirit, responded to the Secretary-General's call for a global ceasefire. This historic agreement provides for the withdrawal of all military units and armed groups from the frontlines; the departure of all mercenaries and foreign fighters from the entire Libyan territory within a period of 90 days. In a further show of Libyan determination, this decision was followed by two subsequent rounds of discussions, taking place on Libyan soil to expedite the operationalization of the ceasefire agreement.

In the southern Libyan city of Ghadames, from 2 to 4 November, I joined both delegations as they developed the terms of a Libyan-led and UN-supported ceasefire monitoring mechanism to be initially established in an area running from Sawknah to Abu Grein and Bin Jawad, in central Libya. In Sirte, from 10 to 13 November, the Commission established its headquarters at the Ouagadougou Conference Centre. Participants identified the reopening of the coastal road between Misrata and Sirte, supported by the deployment of a joint security force as well as the withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries from the area.

I am pleased to report that tangible progress was achieved as part of the package of confidence-building measures agreed in Geneva: flights between Benghazi and Tripoli as well as to Sebha, Ghat and Ubari have resumed and I am hopeful to see a reopening of flights to Ghadames happening soon. The exchange of detainees continues, facilitated by the elders' councils and with the support of the Joint Military Commission. The sharp decrease in the number of civilian casualties compared to the second quarter of 2020 is another reminder that when guns are silent, civilians are protected.

Following arrangements to remove foreign forces from the oil installations, the National Oil Corporation progressively lifted the force majeure on oil installations, ending the oil blockade imposed on the country for over nine months. Oil production is now back to pre-blockade levels at 1.2 million barrels per day. Progress on a transparent economic arrangement on the management of oil revenues would help support this very positive development. The resumption of oil production, in addition to the ceasefire, created conditions to address underlying security issues. On 16 November, I joined a meeting with the Chairman of the National Oil Corporation and the eastern and western commanders of the Petroleum Facilities Guard in Brega to discuss the unification and restructuring of the guard force.

In another sign of progress, on 13 October, the Board of Trustees of the Libyan Investment Authority announced that it would conduct its first comprehensive audit since it was created in 2008. In combination with the ongoing UNSMIL facilitated financial audit review of the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya, these twin audits will significantly increase transparency in how public funds are being managed.

Madam President, Excellencies,

The high standard of professionalism and responsibility displayed by the Joint Military Commission and progresses achieved on the security track paved the way for the resumption of the political process.

Last week, starting formally on 9 November, I convened the first in-person session of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) in Tunis on the basis of the Berlin Conference Conclusions endorsed by UNSC Resolution 2510 (2020). In the lead up, I held separately a series of virtual consultations with large groups of Libyan mayors, women and youth to hear their recommendations and priorities and inform the discussions of the Dialogue. I would like to reiterate the Organization's and my personal gratitude to the Tunisian Presidency's gracious hosting of this first round of intra-Libyan political talks.

Amongst the 75 participants representing the main Libyan geographical, social and political constituencies, 26 were elected by the House of Representatives (HoR) and the High Council of State (HCS), and 49 - including 16 women - selected by UNSMIL. I am pleased to report that discussions took place in a constructive and collegial atmosphere and I applaud the participants for their good will and perseverance.

On 15 November, the LPDF adopted a political road map to presidential and parliamentary elections to be held on 24 December 2021, which marks the 70th anniversary of Libya's independence. The agreed document, entitled ""The Preparatory Phase for a Comprehensive Solution"" complements the Libyan Political Agreement and sets general principles and objectives guiding the transition period under reconstituted and unified institutions as well as the main timeframes for the endorsement of a new executive authority by the House of Representatives, and milestones for the constitutional arrangements and elections.

With a the date of elections fixed in approximately 12 months, the roadmap sets out clear deadlines by which relevant institutions must take action on the appointment for sovereign positions, and the endorsement of the new executive authority, failing which the LPDF will reconvene and take decisions, in line with the Berlin conclusions and resolution 2510. The LPDF has been mandated to meet regularly to monitor the implementation of the roadmap to ensure that the benchmarks towards elections are met. These mechanisms are set up to prevent a new open-ended transition and as a guarantee to the overwhelming demand of the Libyan people for national elections.

Key human rights principles that emerged from consultations with civil society actors, including women rights activists, were also included in the roadmap, further serving to underpin a rights-centred process.

The Forum's participants also consensually agreed on the new prerogatives and eligibility criteria for the executive positions. Notably participants agreed to reform the powers and competencies of the Presidency Council and establish a separate Prime Minister. A government of national unity will be led by a Prime Minister and two deputies whose main mandate will be to lead the transitional period towards election, reunify state institutions, and provide security and basic services to the population until elections are held.

I am particularly grateful to the women participants who played a critical role in the LPDF and made important contributions as bridge builders. They issued a statement outlining a series of principles and recommendations for improving women's participation in the political process and governance. They called for better representation in political life, and for the State to fulfill its international commitments regarding the rights and protection of women. Their demand that women should account for no less than 30 per cent of leadership positions in the reformed executive authority was also echoed in the roadmap.

Next week, I will reconvene the LPDF virtually to continue talks on the modalities for selection of executive positions.

Madam President, Excellencies,

Libyans have made it clear. Organization of presidential and parliamentary elections is their demand and must be our common objective. The chairman of the High National Election Commission (HNEC), Dr. Emad Sayeh, confirmed that this sovereign institution has the technical capacity to implement elections within an enabling political and security environment, a feasible legislative framework and a timely and sufficient budget. I am encouraged by Prime Minister Sarraj's announcement on 16 November that the government will allocate funds and resources for the HNEC. I trust this statement will be promptly translated into facts, as I believe that, together with the LPDF's agreement to hold elections on 24 December 2021, and the exceptional work led by the JMC on security arrangements, there is now a more conducive environment for holding inclusive and credible elections.

I am also gladly acknowledging that the Central Committee for Municipal Council Elections (CCMCE) has been able to continue with elections in another five municipalities including in Misrata, the third largest Libyan city. I congratulate the CCMCE for succeeding in holding credible elections with all necessary precautionary measures in the midst of an ongoing pandemic and despite a challenging post-war environment.

Madam President, Excellencies,

More work certainly remains to be done, but the Libyans have stood up and did their part. We owe it to them to do ours by fully respecting and supporting these Libyan-Libyan agreements which were reached under the authority of Security Council resolution 2510 (2020) and the outcomes of the Berlin Conference. This includes respect for the principle of non-interference in Libya's internal affairs and full implementation of the UN arms embargo on Libya.

This Council has tools at its disposal including to prevent obstructionists from jeopardizing this rare opportunity to restore peace in Libya. I call on you to use them.

Madam President, Excellencies,

Allow me to reiterate that the situation remains volatile; there is no time for complacency.

While the Joint Military Commission seeks to operationalize the ceasefire agreement, the two sides have not yet begun to withdraw their forces. Government of National Accord forces remain stationed at Abu Grein and al-Washkah, with patrolling activities reportedly taking place. Military cargo flights were monitored at al-Watiya and Misrata airports. The Libyan Arab Armed Forces and auxiliaries continued to set up fortifications and military outposts equipped with air defence systems between Sirte and al-Jufra, and in the northern area of al-Jufra airbase. Intense cargo aircraft activity was monitored between Benina airport, al-Jufra and al-Gardabiya airbase.

On the economic front, negotiation of a durable economic arrangement for the transparent distribution of oil revenues remains dependent on advances made in the political track. Under the arrangements for resuming oil production, the National Oil Corporation is holding oil revenue in reserve until an agreement is found. While the Libyan economic dialogue has developed policy options to improve wealth management, negotiating such an arrangement remains challenging given the polarisation between the two executive polities.

Madam President, Excellencies,

The killing of Ms. Hanan al-Barassi, a lawyer and vocal critic of corruption, abuse of power and human rights violations, should lead all Libyans to put their differences aside and swiftly forge an inclusive solution to the protracted crisis to restore justice and accountability and to end the prevailing climate of impunity. Her brutal slaying in Benghazi illustrates the threats faced and the personal risks Libyan women take for speaking out.

Many people remain arbitrarily detained in Libya, without the judicial systems in place to challenge the basis for their detention. As this Council has heard before, illegal detention facilities operated by armed groups are part of the war economy, using torture, extortion, rape and other human rights abuses as tools of control. I once again reiterate calls for all illegal facilities to be identified and closed.

Humanitarian needs, compounded by the increasing impact of COVID-19, will remain in the near-term as agreements materialize on the ground and the economy rebounds. It is estimated that for the beginning of 2021, 1.3 million people will be in need of some form of humanitarian assistance, an increase of 40 per cent compared to last year.

Following the suspension of hostilities, the number of displaced people in Libya reduced from 426,000 people in June to 392,000 people, but their return to their homes has been slow as basic services remain lacking. The risks posed by booby-traps, including IEDs, landmines, and explosive remnants of war will continue to impede safe and dignified returns until all contaminated areas are cleared.

This year, more than 11,000 migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe have been intercepted at sea and returned to Libya, which is by all definitions not a safe port for return. The numbers already far surpass the total for 2019. Hundreds have paid the ultimate price, with more than 900 migrants and refugees drowning, or presumed drowned, in the Mediterranean in 2020. On 12 November, three deadly shipwrecks, recorded in one day, claimed over 100 lives.

Migrants and refugees remaining in Libya have faced an upsurge in grave protection risks and violations of their human rights. On 10 November, a 15-year-old Eritrean asylum seeker was killed, and two others were injured when armed men entered the property where they were staying and started shooting. The young victim was waiting resettlement out of Libya to a third country. This follows other incidents this year where migrants and refugees have been killed or injured; many others have been arbitrarily detained. As of 8 November, more than 2,000 migrants and refugees are in official detention centres in Libya.

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Libya continues to increase month-on-month. As of 15 November, there were 74,324 confirmed cases and 1,025 deaths. The first two weeks of November saw a 22 per cent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, with Libya's biggest cities - Tripoli, Misrata and Benghazi - witnessing the largest increases. With limited testing capacity and poor mortality surveillance, the numbers are a fraction of what health experts suspect to be the true scale of the problem.

At a time when we need to focus efforts on combatting COVID-19, the continued closure of primary health care facilities due to shortages of health care workers, power cuts and lack of personal protective equipment affects not just the ability to effectively combat the virus but also for people to continue to access other essential health services.

Equally, a recent assessment of vaccines in Libya shows that supplies of vaccines for common childhood diseases will run out by the end of the year if no immediate measures are taken to procure and distribute additional supplies. This will be Libya's second vaccine stockout in 2020. This means that many children have missed or may miss their scheduled vaccine doses, which increases the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

The UN and our partners are at the forefront supporting the national authorities with their COVID-19 response, including providing health supplies and personal protection equipment, as well as capacity building of health workers. We are also supporting to alleviate the suffering of those most affected and in need of assistance due to the protracted conflict and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, reaching more than 309,000 people with humanitarian assistance this year.

Madam President, Excellencies,

I am optimistic about the way forward in Libya yet clear-eyed about the many challenges that lie ahead. Ten years of war cannot be solved in one week of political talks, but we hear more now the language of peace rather than the language of war. For the sake of Libya, seventy-five Libyans came together in Tunis last week in a good faith effort to start the process of healing their nation's wounds. They sat, they talked (as they say in Libya, gamiz wa hadriz), they extended their hands, if not their hearts, to each other. I have witnessed in the past several months the potential for a paradigm shift in how Libyan military, political, and leaders view their role in charting the country's path forward from one of a transactional power-sharing arrangement in which the riches are divided up amongst the privileged few to one of sharing responsibility in order to save the country from further destruction. Only shared responsibility, nurtured by patriotism and love of the country, can lead to the shared security and prosperity for which so many Libyans yearn. Libyans deserve, if not the support, then at least the non-interference of the main international actors as they seek to forge a sovereign political path forward for future Libyan generations.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Geneva', 'Ghadames', 'Sirte', 'Libya', 'Berlin', 'Misrata', 'Saint Vincent and the Grenadines', 'Tunis', 'Ouagadougou', 'Ubari', 'Brega', 'Sabha, Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Benghazi', 'Tunisia']",UN's Williams addresses Security Council,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/11/21/uns-williams-addresses-security-council/,None,

Acting Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (ASRSG) and Head of the United Nations Support Mission (UNSMIL) in Libya Stephanie Williams announced yesterday the conclusion of the first round of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), which took place from 7-15 November in Tunis, Tunisia.

The talks took place on the basis of the mandate of Security Council Resolution 2510 (2020), which endorsed the conclusions of the Berlin Conference on Libya held on 19 January 2020.

The 75 Libyan representatives to the LPDF consensually agreed on a Roadmap to credible, inclusive and democratic national elections, to be held on 24 December 2021. This historic date, which will mark 70 years to the day since Libya declared independence in 1951, will finally provide Libyans with an opportunity to end the transitional phase and choose a new way forward.

The roadmap represents a rights-based process and responds to the hopes and demands expressed by the many Libyan stakeholders, groups and people the UN has engaged with throughout this process thus far.

Participants also agreed the need to reform the executive authority in line with the conclusions of the Berlin Conference. They outlined the structure and prerogatives for the Presidency Council and a separate Head of Government. They also decided on eligibility criteria for these posts.

Women participants at the LPDF came together to issue a statement outlining a series of principles and recommendations for improving women's participation in the political process and governance. They stated the need for better representation of women in political life, and for the State to fulfill its international commitments regarding the rights and protection of women. Their demand that women should account for no less than 30% of leadership positions in the reformed executive authority was also echoed in the Roadmap, attesting to the positive role they played in the dialogue.

The Roadmap, Prerogatives Document, Eligibility Criteria and the statement from the women participants form the formal outputs of this round of the LPDF. Discussions will continue in the coming weeks online over reforming the executive, and on the constitution. An online meeting of the LPDF is already planned for November 23 in order to reach an agreement on the selection criteria for the reformed Presidency Council and the Prime Minister.

No single event can ever fully represent Libya's diversity. This latest round of the LPDF came after months of consultations and work with youth, women, municipalities, the Libyan Economic Experts Commission and the rapidly progressing military talks with the Joint Military Commission. All these tracks will continue in parallel with the political process over the next few months.'

The conflict has further exacerbated threats to media freedom in Libya.

Journalists and media professionals work under extremely high personal risk in Libya which ranks 164 on the World Press Freedom Index in 2020. In May 2020, photojournalist Ismail Bouzriba Al-Zoui was sentenced to no less than 15 years in prison by a military court in Benghazi.

Mohammed Omar Baio, Head of the Libyan Media Office, was unlawfully arrested in Tripoli on 20 October. Journalists invited to international events have been harassed upon their return to Libya.

Journalists, media professionals, bloggers and activists have a crucial role in holding governments to account and ensuring people have access to impartial and valid information. Libya has recently seen an unprecedented increase in disinformation circulating on social media and offline, fuelling the conflict.

Professional journalism and a trustworthy press are urgently needed to counter false narratives and incitement of hate. Libya stands at a crossroads in its peace process. To build trust among society, and thus contribute to lasting peace, political leaders in Libya must support a free press and create a safe environment for media workers.

We urge the Libyan leadership to protect independent media and bring to justice those who commit crimes against journalists. Journalists should be able to carry out their work without fear of violence, censorship or threats of prosecution under false pretences and charges. We also ask the Libyan authorities to ease obstacles that foreign journalists encounter to doing their job in Libya.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Benghazi']",EU calls for Safe Environment for Libyan Journalists,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/11/13/eu-calls-for-safe-environment-for-libyan-journalists/,None,

This decision is a product of the confidence that has been built as a result of the October 23 ceasefire agreement and the follow-up talks of the Joint Military Commission in Ghadames on 2-4 November.

Amid these positive developments, the Mission notes with great concern that between 1 and 5 November, a number of individuals from the east who travelled to Tripoli were arbitrarily arrested by armed groups. At least one person was followed to his destination in Tripoli and then arrested, others were allegedly arrested at the airport upon arrival.

UNSMIL reiterates that all Libyan citizens have the right to freedom of movement. Any illegal infringement of this right is a serious violation of Libya's obligations under international law.

Good afternoon

Let me start by thanking you for the trust you place in the United Nations, and for the kind words you have addressed to me and UNSMIL team. We are honored by the trust the Libyan people have historically placed in the United Nations, and we feel a great sense of responsibility in bringing you together.

I want to thank you for the constructive spirit that you have showed over the past two days and for the important points that you have raised in your statements.

First, I would like to once again recall how we got here, what our mandate is, and what are the objectives of this dialogue. We know that no single dialogue can solve all of Libya's problems. But you are called urgently to address some of the most burning issues that are affecting the daily lives of Libyan people, through the restoration of Libya's sovereignty and an effective governance for the people.

This meeting, the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum, is just the latest step on a long path. When world leaders came together in Berlin in January of this year, they asked the UN to facilitate an inclusive intra-Libya political and reconciliation process. The UN Security Council endorsed the Berlin Conference Conclusions in resolution 2510, noting that the Libyan Political Agreement of 2015 and its institutions should serve as ""a"" viable framework for a political solution in Libya, as well as other relevant UNSC Resolutions and the principles agreed in Paris, Palermo and Abu Dhabi. Resolution 2510 also echoed the requests of Libyans that we have heard for over a year now: the need to use these intra-Libyan talks to establish a functioning Presidency Council and form a single, unified, inclusive and effective Libyan government. And it asks us to find a way to end the transitional period through free, fair, inclusive and credible parliamentary and presidential elections organized by an independent and effective High National Elections Commission.

Over the past two days I have taken note of your requests and observations about how we should conduct the dialogue and what should be the key elements of the political process and the preparatory phase. These include the creation of a new executive authority that is capable of organizing elections on a clear constitutional basis, and implementing the political, economic and military reforms necessary to give the Libyan people a sense of normalcy back in their lives.

You have stressed the importance of designing a thorough roadmap for the Libyan political process post-LPDF, to develop a national charter that is based on the principles of accountability, justice and human rights and a firm commitment to a civilian state. You have also stressed the importance of national reconciliation and of building trust within the Libyan society. To empower strong, effective and legitimate institutions, that should work on the basis of transparency and accountability to fight corruption, as well as of decentralization to ensure adequate provision of services to the people.

Tomorrow, after the opening ceremony, we will work with you to develop a road map that outlines how we will get this done. We will also establish a drafting committee as many of you have requested today, which will help us to work more efficiently and consensually.

Once the roadmap is adopted, and we have committed to the Libyan people a clear and accountable path to elections, will have to decide how the country should be governed until in the end of this short preparatory period. Each and every one of you will have a say in these important decisions, which are vital to the future of you country. It will be important to reach these decisions in a timely manner, in accordance with the following principles which UNSMIL is putting forward based on international best practices. As the mediator of this process, I ask you to cooperate by adhering to these principles throughout the dialogue process.

You have a great responsibility in front of you. Many of you have put yourself forward for such responsibility before. Almost half of you, 36 in total have been elected to office in Libya at some point in the last 10 years. Many others have worked in civil society or been active in your local communities.

I want to close today's session to reiterate the importance of your role for the future of Libya through your contribution in the dialogue. Your fellow citizens are looking at you and waiting to see what you produce. We cannot disappoint them. It is your responsibility to deliver and offer new hope to Libyans. And should you be willing to take up this task, I assure you that the United Nations will accompany you on this journey, we will stand by you and we will do everything within our means to support you.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Palermo', 'Abu Dhabi']",Williams' Closing Remarks after LPDF Meetings,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/11/09/williams-closing-remarks-after-lpdf-meetings/,None,

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Libyan Bureau of Statistics and Census (BSC) has signed an agreement today with the aim of enhancing the efforts of the BSC to obtain quality statistics, which is critical to develop data based public policies and to measure the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in the country.

Through this agreement, UNDP and the BSC will collaborate to set up mechanisms for the BSC to use digital tools for data collection and analysis in regular surveys (Household Survey) and statistical studies, and to put in place SDGs monitoring tools, as well as to train the staff to define SDGs baselines indicators towards the achievement of the Agenda 2030.

During the signing ceremony held online, Chairman of BSC, Mr. Abdella Allag, said:

""This agreement signed today allows BSC to benefit from international expertise on modern methods of data collection and analysis in light of the great revolution of technology, such as digital methods of collecting and analyzing data. The Bureau of Statistics and Census is a long-established institution that majors in using traditional methods to collect data, however, we seek to use modern technology-based methods to monitoring sustainable development indicators after raising the capacities of BSC staff in this area.""

On his part, UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Gerardo Noto, stated:

""We live in the data revolution time since advances in information technology and data science now make it possible to process and analyze big data in real-time. However, institutions in Libya still do not have access to adequate data on their entire population. Data is the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability. It can shed light on disparities in society that were previously hidden. At this time of hopeful peacebuilding, this support has additional value for the development and reconstruction ahead in Libya.

""This agreement that we are signing today is crucial for Libyan institutions to be able to realize the opportunities presented by systematic data generation and analysis as well as big data to develop public policies and to advance on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, leaving no one behind.""

Within this collaboration, UNDP will support the BSC to undertake a Rapid Household Survey, set a baseline and indicators of 10 SDGs selected in coordination with the concerned National Authorities; perform an SDGs Desk review, implement a capacity building programme for the BSC staff; as well as further explore opportunities to support the BSC in the long term.",Libya Business News,energy,,['Libya'],Initiative to Improve Data Collection in Libya,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/11/08/initiative-to-improve-data-collection-in-libya/,None,

Only US $ 33 million of gas and condensate sales. It is noteworthy that the revenues for the month of September reflect sales of the month of August, in which the ports were suffering from forced closures.

October's revenue was 230.2 million US dollars, compared to 2 billion US dollars in October 2019, as the established crude oil sales recorded 179.9 million US dollars, 42.1 million US dollars from gas and condensate sales, and 8.1 million US dollars from product sales.

The NOC reiterates its full commitment to the highest standards of transparency in all its business operations. To guarantee such transparency, the NOC has published all data related to oil revenues on a monthly basis since January 2018, and the NOC will continue to rigorously fulfil its commitments to provide Libyan authorities and the public with a thorough and complete accounting of all revenues and deposits.

At the direction of relevant Libyan authorities and consistent with its domestic and international legal obligations, the NOC deposits all such revenues in its account at the Libyan Foreign Bank.

After the signing of two Exploration and Production Sharing Agreements (EPSAs) in December 2019, WIAG had continued to transitionally operate the fields while SOO was being established and prepared to assume operational responsibility. The vast majority of WIAG's Libyan personnel has been transferred to SOO and will continue to work in their previous roles.

Oil production in the fields located in Contract Areas 91 and 107 has been suspended since mid-January 2020 due to blockades of the export infrastructure. Although the coronavirus pandemic and the conflict in Libya have posed additional significant challenges during the past months, NOC and WIAG are nonetheless convinced that as a result of a comprehensive and diligent transitional process, SOO has successfully been enabled to operate the fields in a reliable manner and in accordance with good oilfield practices.

Background

Wintershall Dea (formerly Wintershall and DEA) has been involved in the exploration and production of crude oil in Libya since 1958. Its affiliate Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft (WIAG), a joint venture of Wintershall Dea and Gazprom EP International, has since 1966 discovered, developed and operated nine oil fields across two concessions in the Sirte Basin, located about 1,000 kilometres southeast of the capital Tripoli in the Al-Wahat municipality.

Since 2008, Gazprom EP International holds a share of 49% in WIAG. The most important field is the As-Sarah Field near the oasis settlement of Jakhira. In December 2019, the concessions were converted to EPSA IV contracts, operatorship of the fields was transferred on 29 October 2020 to Sarir Oil Operations (SOO), a newly established joint venture between Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft (WIAG) and the National Oil Corporation (NOC).

Today, through its Stabilization Facility for Libya (SFL), UNDP delivered five testing machines to the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) in Misrata.

This lot is included in a series of equipment that UNDP, as part of the UN response, is providing to the Ministry of Health and NCDC to help local authorities contain the pandemic in Libya.

Each of those machines have the capacity of undertaking 170 tests in eight hours. The equipment will be further distributed to five municipalities determined according to the national strategic plan for increasing the testing capacity. Those municipalities will be having inhouse capacity to carry out COVID-19 tests and get results on a timely manner.

Dr. Khaled Al-Shtaiwi, Head of the National Center for Disease Control in Misrata said:

''The number of people who acquire the infection is still increasing. We need to enhance our national testing capacity and ensure all other measures are taken in order to contain the spread of the pandemic.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), through the Stabilization Facility for Libya (SFL), handed over to the contractor the site of the National Legal Training Center for its construction.

With this project, SFL aims to response to the increasing demand from the local community to have more space at the Ubari University for law studies. The Stabilization Facility will construct an educational building composed of three floors with lecture halls, offices, conference rooms, and utilities. It will support the higher education services and will be an extension of the recently established Faculty of Law at Ubari University.

After completion, the building will accommodate more than 400 students, including 280 women out of 920 students currently enrolled at the Faculty of Law from Ubari and neighboring municipalities such as Ghat, Al-Ghourifa, and Bent-Baya.

Women who cannot travel away from Ubari for social reasons will have an opportunity to complete their education near their homes and, therefore, this construction will contribute to gender equality in the south of Libya.

During a ceremony that took place at Ubari University, Mr. Sanoussi Chadko, Deputy Mayor of Ubari said:

""We are very happy with the support received from UNDP during the last three years in terms of infrastructure renovation and delivery of equipment. Today, with the construction of the new Legal Training Center, we start the second phase of UNDP's projects that will be implemented in our municipality. In the past, Ubari was called a ghost town. Today, it has become a city of security, peace, development, and stability. We are very grateful and are looking for more projects in the city.""

Peace be upon you and good morning,

On behalf of Mr. Ant?nio Guterres, SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations

I am honored to be here today to witness history being made.

I want to pay tribute to you. What you have accomplished here takes a great deal of courage. You have come together for the sake of Libya, for the sake of your people, to take tangible steps and end their suffering.

I want to commend your commitment in coming together to reach an agreement that can help secure a better, more secure and peaceful future for all the Libyan people. I salute your sense of responsibility and your commitment to preserve Libya's unity and to reassert its sovereignty.

This week, you have come together, first and foremost, as Libyan patriots. No one but Libyans love Libya as much as you do, nor understand what needs to be done to restore and preserve your country. The road has been long and, at times, difficult, but you have been guided by your patriotism and have succeeded in forging an agreement for a durable and lasting ceasefire.

I hope that this agreement will end the suffering of the Libyan people and enable those in the diaspora and Internally-Displaced Persons scattered to return to their homes and live in peace and safety.

I particularly want to acknowledge the professionalism and the mutual respect you have all demonstrated towards each other throughout these negotiations. You have set a high standard and excellent example for your compatriots who are participating in the political and economic tracks. You did your part -- and did it very well -- they will now need to do theirs.

I would also like to extend thanks and appreciation to the President of the Presidency Council, Mr. Fayez Sarraj, and the other members of the Council, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Agila Saleh and Field Marshal General Commander Khalifa Haftar, for their efforts and support to the Commission.

We must not forget those Libyans who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of this country, as well as the injured and amputees.

I believe what you have achieved here together represents an important milestone for Libya and for the Libyan people. It is my most fervent hope that today's agreement will be celebrated by future generations of Libyans as representing that first, crucial, brave step towards a comprehensive settlement of the long Libyan crisis.

We have a lot of work to do in the days and weeks ahead to implement the commitments outlined in this agreement, and to flesh out the work of the subcommittees. It is important that we follow through with meaningful action as quickly as possible in order to ease the many hardships this conflict has caused to the Libyan people, and to give them that important measure of hope for a better future.

I know that I can continue to count on you. I know the Libyan people can count on you.

Following my involvement in a variety of voluntary and civil-society projects, I decided to search for an opportunity to broaden my horizons and increase my impact. That search lead me to the Chevening Scholarships, a UK Government programme that offers future leaders the opportunity to study in the UK.

The main part of the application process was essay writing. There are four essays (Leadership and Influence, Networking, studying in the UK, and Career Plan); each essay is 500 words and I needed to encapsulate all my experience into those essays to help represent me best. After careful planning and writing I summited my application and patiently awaited the results.

To my great joy, I was chosen for the interview stages. This was an important step towards being chosen as a Chevening scholar. Thus, I prepared for the interview by asking previous Chevening scholars, looking online, and conducting a mock interview, which I hugely advise others chosen to do.

Now looking at how I have managed to reach to this stage. The essays I have written and the quality of writing were important to be chosen for the interview stages. The essays need to reflect your passion, dream, goals, in a systematic approach that enables the committee to feel the important contribution you can make to the community and society. The importance of interlinking your chosen subject with your experience and goals is crucial.

For example, I had a Bachelor in Civil Engineering and a Master in Structural Engineering with Management, but also a passion for relationships with the international community. I ensured that my essays explained:

The need to carefully adjust all four essays towards portraying the best image of your character, abilities, experience, and goals is the most important part in the initial application process. This will make your application competitive and give you a greater chance of being selected from the thousands applying.

I wish everyone applying for this opportunity the best. I will follow up on the dates, and once the interview stages are announced, I will ensure that I write more about what to look for and how to prepare for it.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any support or help. Thank you.

Because of my experiences both as a student and as a teacher in Libya, developing the education system in my country has become the ultimate aim in my career.

Having decided that studying in a multicultural environment would be the ideal preparation for these plans I aimed to study for an MA in the United Kingdom. The head of the English department of my college, Hani Erteme, recommended the Chevening Scholarship programme to me and encouraged me to apply for it. When I had a look at the scholarship, it seemed an ideal fit.

I applied for the scholarship in 2018 and was accepted first-time, starting my master's course in Applied Linguistics for TESOL in September 2019; I just finished it in September 2020. This full-time master's year in the UK was an extraordinary experience for me; it exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed and made the most of every single day during this year as a Chevening scholar and a UK graduate student.

The education system here in general is impressive. It was interesting to me how courses are managed and how each module of the whole year is planned, structured and well organised. I enjoyed how my tutors and professors were more than cooperative and friendly. It was really helpful how the staff of the university facilitates the procedures and how almost everything is available online at my student's portal, i.e. modules, lectures, letters, requests, enquiries, timetable, assignments, reading list, etc.

Even with the COVID-19 and the lockdown it caused, I still did not feel left out by the university. The tutors kept checking up on all the students, made sure they are not mentally overwhelmed and helped a lot with deadline issues. Aside from the knowledge I gained from the course, I gained what I mainly came for, ideas about developing the education system.

Throughout the year, I kept taking notes of everything related to education that I can adapt and implement in my country. The ideas and experiences I have gained in one year as a graduate student and a Chevening scholar here in the UK would not have been gained in years elsewhere.

After this massive experience, I believe I am ready for my next stage, developing the education system in my country.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['United Kingdom', 'Libya']",Chevening Scholars share their Experiences,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/10/20/chevening-scholars-share-their-experiences/,None,

These tracks were endorsed by Security Council Resolution 2510 (2020), which called on both parties to reach an agreement for a permanent ceasefire.

Verified photographic evidence shows indiscriminately placed booby-traps and minefields around the outskirts of Tripoli down to Sirte since mid-June. These weapons are assessed to have been introduced into Libya by the Wagner Group.

""The Russian-state sponsored Wagner Group is demonstrating a total disregard for the safety and security of Libyans,"" said U.S. Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Bradford Gering, director of operations, U.S. Africa Command. ""The Wagner Group's irresponsible tactics are prolonging conflict and are responsible for the needless suffering and the deaths of innocent civilians. Russia has the power to stop them, just not the will.""

In late May, AFRICOM reported that at least 14 Mig-29s had been flown from Russia to Syria, where their Russian markings were painted over to camouflage their Russian origin. The aircraft were then flown into Libya, a violation of the United Nations arms embargo. AFRICOM assesses that the warplanes were being actively flown in Libyan airspace, further complicating the conflict in Libya and elevating the risk of miscalculation.

Russia's introduction of landmines, booby traps, attack aircraft, and their continued support of the 2,000-person strong Wagner Group in Libya changes the nature of the current conflict and intensifies the potential risk to non-combatants.

However, Khalifa Hafter's armed forces (KHAF) on 11 July ordered a halt to further exports, reversing their cooperative posture in negotiations.

This is gravely disappointing, especially following repeated statements by very senior representatives of the UAE last week in support of international efforts to restart oil production in Libya.

Special Representative for Syria Engagement and Special Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Ambassador James Jeffrey, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Henry Wooster, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Christoper Robinson On Russian Engagement in the Middle East

Office of the Spokesperson

For Immediate Release

ON-THE-RECORD-BRIEFING

May 7, 2020

Via Teleconference

MS ORTAGUS: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Good to be on with everybody this Thursday afternoon. This is going to be another on-the-record briefing here at the State Department, and please, as always, this briefing is embargoed until the end of the call.

Today we want to shed some light on Russians' - Russian malign engagement in the Middle East with a specific focus on Russian actions in Syria and in Libya. We have all been witnesses to Russia cynically helping the deadly Assad regime stay in power, hanging on by a thread and refusing to budge on meaningful political dialogue with the Syrian opposition. More recently, Russia has exploited instability in Libya to advance its own military, economic, and geopolitical interest in that country and throughout North America.[1]

To help provide additional context, we have an all-star cast of briefers today, real experts in the field whom most of you know on this topic. We have Deputy Assistant Secretary Christopher Robin[2] from our Bureau of European and Eurasian affairs. He'll speak first. We'll be followed - he'll be followed by Deputy Assistant Secretary Henry Wooster from our Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs who covers the Maghreb and Egypt portfolios. Last but not least, we have my favorite ambassador, of course, Jim Jeffrey, who's our special representative for Syria engagement and the special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.

And just a reminder that while this call is on the record, this briefing is embargoed until the end of the call. Chris, go ahead.

MR ROBINSON: All right. So good afternoon. It's a real pleasure to be here with all of you. Wish we could do this in person, but allow me to frame the conversation from the Russia perspective to start this out. As I recently told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Russia has ramped up its unconstructive behavior in the Middle East since 2015, when Russia expanded its actions in Syria in support of the Assad regime. More recently, Libya has become the next venue for Russia's malign efforts to exploit regional conflicts for its own narrow political and economic gain. While Russia often publicly claims support for a political solution, such as in Syria or Libya, it simultaneously engages in activities that undermine a political peace process and widen the conflict.

In Libya, Russia continues its military support for the Libyan National Army of General Haftar. Russia has provided material and logistical support to the Wagner Group, a U.S.-sanctioned entity led by Putin crony Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is also sanctioned by the United States. Russia's surge in support to the LNA has led to a significant escalation of the conflict and a worsening of the humanitarian situation in Libya. Wagner is often misleadingly referred to as a Russian private military company, but in fact it's an instrument of the Russian Government which the Kremlin uses as a low-cost and low-risk instrument to advance its goals. More recently, Russia in coordination with the Assad regime has ferried Syrian fighters to Libya to participate in Wagner operations in support of the LNA.

Meanwhile, Russia for years has conducted a disinformation campaign to discredit international organizations working on these conflicts such as the United Nations and the OPCW. Russia has leveled ludicrous claims that the United States is responsible for the creation of ISIS, that the White Helmets in Syria have links to terrorism, and that the UK special forces fabricated the 2018 chemical attack in Douma.

Finally, Russia has engaged in a disinformation campaign to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Russian disinformation claims that the United States or Western powers are the origin of the virus while instilling uncertainty about the international response. Through such tactics, Russia clearly signals it's willing to take advantage of a global crisis in order to pursue its own destabilizing agenda without any regard for the human consequences. This administration is engaged in a range of actions to blunt Moscow's efforts to exert malign influence in Libya and Syria, and it's not too late for Moscow to change course and genuinely support a political settlement to both of these conflicts.

I'll stop there and then we can move on to - and get to questions.

MS ORTAGUS: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Henry.

MR WOOSTER: Hey, thanks, Morgan, and thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, folks out in the virtual ether. In Libya we've got two goals: one, an immediate end to the conflict; and two, a return to political negotiations, or dialogue, if you will. So let me walk you through how we see malign influence out there.

Our starting point is that foreign intervention has exacerbated divisions, widened the conflict, transformed it into a proxy war, threatened regional stability, and as you can imagine, in combination all of these things impinge upon (inaudible) if they don't harm, in fact, U.S. interests - thus our interests. So as Chris noted, the Kremlin uses this combination of military power, proxies, and disinformation to shape outcomes, and specifically, Moscow is seeking an enhanced presence in Libya to expand its influence across the Med and also onto the African continent.

And more specifically, Wagner support to Haftar's LNA or, if you will, the Libyan National Army has escalated the conflict. It's emboldened the LNA to continue its offensive which in turn is destabilizing, pushing the Government of National Accord - the internationally recognized government which the United States recognizes - it's pushed them to seek increased Turkish support to counter the Wagner-based LNA assault. So you see the escalatory effects here.

No one should think that Russia is going to pack up and leave now that they've invested in the Libyan conflict. So the way to end Russian and other foreign interference in Libya is to first end the Tripoli conflict - of course, that's the pretext - end that and revive political talks between the Libyans, and this done through UN-facilitated negotiations.

Lastly, on my end of it, a coordinated response from the international community pressing all the actors, Libyan and external, to deescalate is imperative. We, the United States, for our part will continue to press Russia, Turkey, the UAE, among others to encourage LNA and the GNA to return to these UN negotiations. We're looking for a lasting ceasefire that they (inaudible) sides had agreed to in Geneva in February. Thank you much.

MS ORTAGUS: Thanks so much, and now Jim. Jim Jeffrey, do we got you?

AMBASSADOR JEFFREY: Hi, Morgan. Thank you very much for those kind words, and hello everybody.

Let me give a little bit of background on Russia in Syria. Most of you follow the day-in day-out stuff quite well. First of all, Russia came in in 2015 to save the Assad regime, which was apparently on its last legs facing an uprising of much of its population. Russia succeeded quite quickly in its initial goal of stabilizing the situation. At the end of 2015, it agreed to a UN resolution, 2254, which is still the relevant resolution for resolving the Syrian conflict that calls for a compromise political solution under the UN, a new constitution, and UN-monitored elections.

Meanwhile, however, in the subsequent two years, Russia, with Iranian engagement as well, saw the Assad regime retake much of Syrian territory from the opposition. So its ambitions seemed to grow. The problem is that two new factors complicated Russia's life. First of all, Iran not only was willing to use forces to bolster the Syrian regime, it also started introducing long-range weapon systems, precision-guided missiles - some for its own forces in Syria, some pushed onward to Hizballah to seriously threaten Israeli security, and the Israelis have reacted in various ways. Occasionally they talk about their operations over Syria to that end. That complicated Russia's calculations. We see no indication they thought that the Syrians would allow the Iranians to exploit it that way.

Secondly, the Assad regime has run into considerable trouble retaking the rest of Syria. For various reasons, U.S. and Turkish forces, as well as Israelis, have entered Syria for one or another security reason. This complicates both Russia and Assad's situation. And Assad has done nothing to help the Russians sell this regime. It is being condemned, as we've seen in the last few weeks, by the secretary-general of the UN himself on the refusal to allow cross-border humanitarian deliveries, by the board of inquiry; the secretary-general (inaudible) for the deliberate attack on supposedly off-limits humanitarian sites such as hospitals in Idlib, and thirdly for use of chemical weapons in 2017 that the OPCW has come out with.

There's obviously growing Russian frustration with Assad because he will not bend. Compare the way the Iranians try to sell themselves with people like Zarif and Rouhani. You find Assad has nothing but thugs around him, and they don't sell well either in the Arab world or in Europe.

Russia seemed to be willing to look at a compromise about a year ago. Mike Pompeo went along with Morgan and me to Sochi to meet with Lavrov and with Putin, and we laid out a way to resolve this on a step-by-step basis. But then soon after, Russia seemed committed to a military solution. That led to the debacle from the standpoint of the Syrian forces in Idlib who now have a ceasefire that appears to be holding. Russia may be more willing now - we've seen some indications in the Russian media and in certain Russian actions to be more flexible on the constitutional committee, but they may once again be willing to talk with us about a way to resolve this short of a military victory, because it's very clear at this point to Russia that they're not going to get a military victory certainly no time soon in Syria. Meanwhile, the Syrian economy is in freefall and the diplomatic isolation continues.

I'll stop there.

Every year, the International Day of Democracy conjures up thoughts of the values of freedom, respect for human rights, and the principle of holding periodic and genuine elections by universal suffrage.

This year, the COVID-19 crisis brings to our mind the idea that Democracy is as much a process as a goal since the pandemic is having an unprecedented effect on citizen participation that can post both a challenge and an opportunity for democratic governance.

While states around the world adopt emergency measures to tackle the impact of COVID-19 in our health systems and our economies, those measures could be a threat to other rights such as freedom of expression and of the press, freedom of information, freedom of association and of assembly. On the other hand, COVID-19 opens unprecedented spaces to reimagine politics and restore confidence in democratic institutions.

In UNDP Libya, today is a day that reminds us of the strong desire and right of the people of Libya to live in peace and prosperity.

In the past decade, the people of Libya have been vocal on their rights to determine their own future. They have been standing up for freedom of expression, for equal justice, for the right to vote a representative and accountable government, and for so much more; in short, for democracy.

Democracy is often understood as the possibility for citizens to vote freely in credible elections for their representatives, to form a government that has a mandate given by the people and accountable to the people.

But it is more than that. Democracy is an entire system that guarantees the separation of powers with a government that is guided by the rule of law. It gives every citizen the right to participate in the political and public policy debate and the freedom to associate. It guarantees freedom of speech, access to justice, equal treatment, independent judiciary and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Moreover, democracy stands for inclusive participation, with the openness to listen to others and commit to overcoming grievances, disputes and conflict through dialogue and peaceful means for the greater good.

Which direction will the transition in Libya move towards? Can an inclusive democratic system encompassing the whole country be set as an immediate outcome of a peace agreement? In the last decade, Libya path for democracy has faced many challenges. The country has witnessed many promising moments but also setbacks. A lot of progress is still to be made. The conflict and divisions have deepened the wounds, now COVID-19 has worsened the situation.

However, the current end of the hostilities could be an opportunity to consolidate a formal ceasefire and a peace settlement that would further enable dialogue and result in an inclusive and broadly accepted political agreement along with a fair distribution of economic resources that brings the country and its people back together.

UNDP has been a longstanding partner of Libya, supporting the country and its people in their efforts for democracy.

Placing 'Good Governance for a Peaceful, Just and Inclusive society in Libya' at the core of our mandate, UNDP has been working with national, local and non-governmental partners on processes that strengthen institutions; facilitate the Libyan political dialogue and foster an inclusive vision for national and local reconciliation; bring the rule of law at the forefront of policing and security; build the capacity and readiness for national elections, and bringing innovative ways to encourage participation in local elections with a focus on women and youth.

Municipal councils are the government institutions that are closest to the people. Local electoral processes renewing the councils' mandate are currently the main means for citizens to express their democratic voice in Libya.

On the local level, Libya sees the fruit of the tireless work of the Central Committee for Municipal Council Elections (CCMCE) growing with the second-generation of council elections started in April 2019 despite the outbreak of violence surrounding Tripoli and lately the measures imposed by the authorities to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 25 councils were elected since the end of 2018, their four-year mandates democratically renewed, with the latest ones in Ghat, Kikla and Misrata despite the pandemic. Following the CCMCE request in 2018, UNDP has been supporting the Committee during THESE challenging times. Citizens electoral participation at the local level is a very strong sign of commitment with democracy by Libyan people.

At the national level, after having provided technical support for the elections in 2012-2014, UNDP and UNSMIL remain dedicated in our assistance to the High National Electoral Commission (HNEC) to maintain the institution readiness and enhance its technical capacity to run national elections when they are called.

UNDP is also working with UNSMIL to further the intra-Libyan Dialogue and promote national reconciliation. Working from the bottom-up, our programmes aim to ensure inclusive and effective mediation processes and the involvement of all constituencies in the furtherance of a comprehensive political settlement, and reforms for the economy and security sector. Support to core government functions, through these programmes, works to ensure that the state holds up its responsibilities to be accountable to Libyans citizens on a renewed social contract.

In partnership also with UNSMIL, UNDP is supporting capacities to advance safety and security by empowering local police and criminal justice institutions towards a more effective and community-oriented policing and rule of law security and justice services.

Democracy is an ongoing process that requires time and patience to develop. It is equally important to comprehend that democracy needs strong support and protection. Furthermore, democracy relies on leaders and people to listen to each other, and to find compromises to overcome disputes and build an inclusive society for the benefit of all.

In the last few weeks, while the number of people affected by COVID-19 is on the rise, we hear the people in Libya who have been demanding, from the East to the West and the South, for peace, better services and quality of life. With all our partners, UNDP will continue to support democracy and participation as the sound foundation for inclusive and sustainable development for all people in Libya.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Misrata', 'Tripoli']",What Battle Against COVID-19 means for Democracy,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/09/18/what-battle-against-covid-19-means-for-democracy/,None,
11399039,2020-07-14,"After several days of intense diplomatic activity aimed at allowing the National Oil Corporation (NOC) to resume its vital and apolitical work as a way of defusing military tensions, the U.S. Embassy regrets that foreign-backed efforts against Libya's economic and financial sectors have impeded progress and heightened the risk of confrontation.

Incursions by Wagner mercenaries against NOC facilities, as well as mixed messages conceived in foreign capitals and conveyed by the so called Libyan National Army (LNA) on July 11, hurt all Libyans striving for a secure and prosperous future. Illegal obstruction of the long-overdue audit of the banking sector further undermines the desire of all Libyans for economic transparency.

These disappointing actions will not deter the Embassy from its commitment to work with responsible Libyan institutions, such as the Government of National Accord (GNA) and the House of Representatives (HOR), to protect Libya's sovereignty, achieve a lasting ceasefire, and support a Libyan consensus on the transparent management of oil and gas revenues.

The door remains open for all who lay down weapons, reject foreign manipulation, and come together in peaceful dialogue to be a part of the solution; however, those who undermine Libya's economy and cling to military escalation will face isolation and risk of sanctions.

11399041,2020-01-28,"The National Oil Corporation (NOC) chairman Mustafa Sanalla has emphasised the importance of the rule of law in Libya as the solution to the protracted conflict during his keynote speech at Chatham House on Monday January 27, 2020.

""The international community has to understand that if it rewards, or even tolerates, those who break the law in Libya, then it will be complicit in the end of the rule of law in our country. And that means more corruption, more crime, more injustice and more poverty,"" he said.

Mr Sanalla spoke about the recent port blockades and the devastating long-term effects they would have on the Libyan economy and the lives of normal Libyans:

""We fully acknowledge there is corruption and injustice in Libya. We are all disgusted and angered by the economic situation. But acting illegally by blocking Libyan oil production will just lead to the further impoverishment of the Libyan state and erosion of the rule of law. We were told that NOC will not receive the requested budget it needs for its ambitious programme to expand oil production - that means billions less for the Libyan people in future years.""

Oil revenues are the backbone of the Libyan economy. They pay salaries for 1.3 million Libyans, support education, health and other crucial services.

The Chairman warned the international community about the precedent of allowing illegal activities:

""How will the international community react to the shutdown of oil? For me it is crucial that illegal behaviour such as this is not rewarded. That is why I publicly denounced the attempts by former UNSMIL Head Kobler to negotiate with Jadhran. That is why I have always opposed giving concessions to blockaders by anyone. Reward such bad behaviour and you will see it repeated, not just in Libya but potentially across the whole of the Middle East and North Africa, as people who feel they have a grievance decide it's worth trying an oil blockade.""

I believe that member countries of the UNSC on the whole want peace, freedom and economic justice?in Libya. But?wanting it is not enough.?It seems that they?are happy?when they?secure?agreement?from a wide range of countries?to?international statements?calling for ceasefires and political settlements.??But they know that many of those countries will sign anything, and then?continue?to supply weaponry to the war-fighters, and to pour poison into social media with their sophisticated?disinformation campaigns, undermining the very?solutions they have officially supported.??We need not just words but action from UNSC members, particularly UK, US and France, who all pride themselves on their support for the rule of law. We need them to?call out the hypocrisy of those countries (or those within their own governments) who prefer instead to?pursue their own national interests at the expense of the Libyan people.

Mr. Sanalla also explained the technical and environmental effects of the blockades: ""Sudden stoppages of oil production are a disaster - crude oil left in pipelines is highly corrosion in the already corroded pipeline and surface equipment. And the effects last for years - in the last five years we had 817 leaks in pipelines damaged by the years of blockades instigated by Ibrahim Jadhran.

""There is a rule of law solution to problems in Libya. It is the only solution. But it seems the countries that have traditionally been the strongest backers of the rule of law need to find their voice and common purpose. This is not about choosing one side or the other in Libya. There are too many sides, too many interests.

11399064,2020-10-13,"Governor of Central Bank of Libya meets with House of Representatives in Consultative Session

The Governor of Central Bank of Libya (CBL), HE Mr Saddek Elkaber, has taken part in a consultative session with the House of Representatives in Tripoli to present an update on the state of the Libyan economy and respond to questions by parliamentarians.

The Governor opened the session with a presentation setting out the main challenges facing the Libyan economy and detailing the pivotal role played by the CBL providing essential economic and financial stability for the country.

He stressed that the CBL is an independent monetary authority that has distanced itself from political polarisation and rivalries, and manages and protects Libya's financial resources and assets for the benefit of all Libyans regardless of where they live.

Following the session CBL Governor HE Mr. Saddek Elkaber remarked that collaboration between all the major economic actors in Libya is necessary if long term financial sustainability is to be achieved. He added, ""Members of the House of Representatives are working very hard to find solutions to the problems that Libya faces, and today's session was a valuable opportunity to brief them on the vital work that the CBL carries out in a quiet but committed manner. In this spirit I called on the President of the Presidential Council of the Government of National Accord to convene an urgent meeting to review the challenges facing us and work constructively to find solutions. As a top priority we must act as a united front to end the oil embargo that has caused significant damage to Libya's economy and foreign reserves"".

The Governor highlighted the suspension of oil production and exports during the period 2013-2020 as the most significant factor facing the country's economy, which has resulted in losses of more than $180 billion USD. Oil revenues decreased from $53.2 billion USD in 2012 to $4.8 billion USD in 2016, and currently stand close to zero in 2020. He warned that should the embargo continue the result will be a catastrophic blow to the CBL's declining foreign reserves as well as the state's ability to cope with crises.

The CBL estimates that the oil embargo has caused the GDP to shrink by 55 percent. Direct revenue losses to the end of September 2020 amounted to $10 billion USD, and oil revenues for September 2020 were a mere $35 million USD, compared to $2 billion for September 2019.

The Governor talked of the CBL's plans for financial reform and role as the economic adviser of the State. He briefed the session that the Bank is preparing a comprehensive economic and financial reform program that addresses the structural imbalances and distortions in the national economy.

The measures taken, in line with international best practice, by the CBL to counter fraud and Anti-Money Laundering were presented. The CBL has developed cross-discipline expertise in the form of the reactivation and expansion of the National Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism Committee. It also adherences to the standards and recommendations set by Financial Action Task Force (""FATF""), the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog. In 2017, the Central Bank of Libya participated in a Technical Assistance Program together with the International Monetary Fund; and with assistance and support from the United States Treasury Department. With their input and advice, the Bank worked extensively to develop the Libyan Anti-Money Laundering (""AML"") and Counter Financing of Terrorism (""CFT"") regime in keeping with international standards, which included developing a framework for compliance, processes and procedures.

The House of Representative members asked what initiative has been made to resolve the issue of the parallel Central Bank. The Governor remarking that under his direction the legitimate CBL has aimed to resolve the situation since 2016. He stressed that the CBL has adhered to the Security Council's decision regarding international auditing of its operation and has begun cooperating with the international auditor. He welcomed the role of the Office of the Attorney General as supervisor, and reaffirmed the CBL's commitment to disclosing information requested by the auditor.

On the issue of Corona-virus, the Governor remarked that the CBL has issued all foreign exchange requests made by the Ministry of Finance for medical purposes, with a total of roughly 1 billion LYD by the close of September 2020, and for the Medial Supply Authority (on the basis of the Chapter 4 ""subsidies"" of the financial arrangement), with a total of 638 Million LYD. The CBL has also issued foreign currency exchange to the value of $489 USD for private sector import of medical equipment and medicine.

The Governor was joined by 12 members of the CBL executive management team, who also participated in the session and gave presentations on the Bank's operations.

The session concluded with a discussion of the accusations made against the CBL by the Minister of Finance and Economy, Mr. Faraj Boumatari. The Governor expressed his regret at Mr. Boumatari's actions that have sought to mislead the Libyan public and damage trust in the financial system, and his subsequent refusal to issue a correction when informed of the damage caused by his media interviews. The CBL has been left with no choice but to refer the matter to the office of the Prosecutor General and resolution through legal means.

To build trust the CBL is operating with a high degree of transparency and is committed to publishing a monthly statement on revenue and public expenditure in Libyan dinars and foreign exchange, in addition to a weekly statement on documentary credits for commercial purposes.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli']",Central Bank Governor meets with House of Representatives,https://www.libya-businessnews.com/2020/10/09/central-bank-governor-meets-with-house-of-representatives/,None,

Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) Stephanie Williams is pleased to announce the finalization of the process to initiate an international audit of the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL).

This is the culmination of a process laudably commenced by GNA Prime Minister Sarraj on July 10, 2018 in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in which he requested the United Nations to facilitate an international audit of the Central Bank branches in Tripoli and Beyda as a means to restore integrity, transparency and confidence in the Libyan financial system and create the conditions for the unification of Libyan financial institutions. On 13 September 2018, the UN Security Council, in Resolution 2434, mandated UNSMIL to support the requested financial review process.

Following several meetings chaired by former SRSG Ghassan Salame in the fall of 2018, Governors Al-Kabir and Al-Hibri agreed to and finalized the Terms of Reference of the audit in December of that year. During this phase of the process, UNSMIL consulted with the International Financial Institutions. In September 2019, representatives of the two branches of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) participated in a selection panel to review bids submitted by qualified international auditing firms.

In compliance with best practices and with the advice of UN technical specialists, the panel voted unanimously to award the contract to Deloitte. UNOPS, the UN agency that managed the procurement process, has now finalized the contract with the awarded company in order for the audit to commence as soon as possible.

The international financial review process is a critical step towards enhancing transparency in the Libyan financial system and creating the conditions for the eventual unification of the CBL. The process is equally important to have an informed dialogue on the equitable distribution of national revenue in Libya and to re-establish national accountability mechanisms.

Beyond its UN Security Council mandate, the international audit review is a top priority for the International Follow Up Committee for Libya established during the Berlin process. As the process begins, the international community and the Libyan public, will be watching closely to ensure that all parties fully cooperate with the process.

UNSMIL wishes to express its thanks to President of the Presidency Council and GNA Prime Minister Sarraj, Governors Al-Kabir and Al-Hibri, Acting Attorney General Sadik Al-Sour and National Audit Bureau Chairman Khaled Shakshak.

UNSMIL will coordinate closely with the National Audit Bureau authorities in western and eastern Libya through the course of the international audit. It is fully expected that the national audit authorities will conduct any follow-on or forensic audits recommended as a result of the international audit.

UNSMIL takes this opportunity, based upon the terms recently put forward by UNSMIL and a number of key member states, to urge for the immediate lifting of the blockade imposed by the Libyan Arab Armed Forces on Libya's oil facilities.

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) has warned that a continuation of the blockade risks further damage to and deterioration of Libya's vital oil infrastructure and pipeline network.

Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) today said is deeply concerned at reports of the increasing likelihood of an intensification of the military conflict, potentially extending to oil and gas facilities.

NOC condemns the deployment of Wagner Group, Syrian and Janjaweed mercenaries in the oil installations, most recently at Es Sidra port, and NOC demands their immediate withdrawal from all facilities. NOC calls on the United Nations Mission in Libya to send observers to supervise the demilitarisation in the areas of NOC operations across the country.

NOC's primary concern is the safety and welfare of the 65,000 staff who work for the NOC across Libya. NOC Chairman Eng Mustafa Sanalla has instructed NOC managers to review safety measures in the light of the increased threats.

But all Libyans need to remember that Libya is dependent on its ability to produce and export oil and gas. Protecting oil infrastructure from damage is therefore a priority for all those who wish Libya to thrive. Unfortunately, there are currently large numbers of foreign mercenaries in NOC facilities who do not share this wish. They work for governments who have an active interest in blockading Libyan production and damaging Libyan infrastructure because this translates into millions of dollars of additional revenue for their own oil industries.

To protect Libyan oil infrastructure, NOC is closely monitoring and documenting the illegal activities currently taking place inside NOC facilities and will continue to do so. NOC will not hesitate to seek prosecution for those who damage Libya's only significant source of revenue.

The ongoing Libyan oil blockade not only helps foreign oil exporters by removing Libyan production from global markets, it also causes enormous damage to Libyan wells, fields and pipelines, further eroding Libya's future wealth and productive capability.

NOC calls on all Libyans to support a lifting of the oil blockade, and to counter the interests of foreign agents intent on preventing Libya from producing oil. It is essential that all Libyans work to prevent control of oil facilities from being used as a political bargaining chip by armed groups. This requires a professional and independent oilfield security force capable of resisting pressure from dissatisfied armed groups.

Transparency from all sides over public money and oil revenues is essential. NOC has been calling for more transparency from all institutions for years.

NOC calls on all parties within Libya to lift the blockade and re-start oil and gas production, so every Libyan can benefit from a stronger economy and a more steady supply of fuels.

NOC provides fuels to people in Eastern regions via different ports across the coastline. A gasoline tanker is preparing to discharge at the Benghazi port today.

Tripoli stations are being provided from its port directly and other cities receive their fuel from the ports in the western region. A gasoline tanker is discharging at the Tripoli port today.

In addition, IOM briefed on the organization's ongoing coordination with Libyan health partners and local authorities to strengthen the COVID-19 response.

Drawing on its vast experience with tracking the movements and needs of vulnerable populations, IOM is working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Libyan National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) to improve disease surveillance at Libya's borders and assist with contact tracing for COVID-19 cases.

IOM has also launched a comprehensive health campaign to improve sanitation, raise awareness about the virus, and provide hygiene kits to migrants in detention centers, to ensure that the most vulnerable and marginalized populations are included in national preventive and public health measures.

IOM is providing health awareness training and medical supplies to Libyan authorities as part of this health campaign. The organization's medical teams continue to administer lifesaving health assistance to vulnerable persons across Libya, including checking for COVID-19 symptoms and offering primary health care.

Ambassador Norland and IOM Chief of Mission Soda also stressed the need for an immediate, humanitarian cessation of hostilities in Libya to allow local authorities the space needed to address the looming COVID-19 threat. They also discussed the need to prevent any discrimination in access to healthcare across Libya. In order to protect the population at large, anyone, including migrants, presenting symptoms of COVID-19 should be able to receive testing and treatment.

Khalifa Haftar told the world he's the only man who can bring stability back to Libya. The warlord launched a military offensive last year to take control of the capital from the UN-recognised government in Tripoli.

But his forces have suffered a series of setbacks in the past month. In the latest, Haftar's forces lost control of the headquarters of his offensive: Al Watiya air base southwest of Tripoli.

Troops backing the government in Tripoli say they've destroyed weapons provided by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. While Prime Minister Fayez Serraj hailed victory, he warned the battle is far from over.

Haftar's spokesman downplayed the loss. How will this shape the course of Libya's civil war, now in its seventh year?

War has raged in western Libya since 4 April 2019. On one side is the Government of National Accord (GNA), Libya's main internationally recognised government. It is heavily dependent on armed groups for the defence of Tripoli, and increasingly reliant on Turkey, which has provided military equipment, trainers and advisers, and thousands of Syrian mercenaries.

Opposing the GNA is General Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) - an alliance of armed groups and foreign mercenaries from Russia, Sudan and Chad. Foreign actors, primarily the United Arab Emirates, have supported the LNA militarily, via direct action, training and equipment, and by providing diplomatic backing and cover.

In 11 months of clashes, the death of around 6 000 fighters and hundreds of civilians, and the displacement of 140 000 Libyans, Haftar's LNA has slowly gained territory in western Libya.

The source said Haftar abstained from paying off the contract not because he lacked money, but because the Russians didn't execute the contract properly.

The source said Wagner Group mercenaries had been doing technical support, training, limited battle operations, cybersecurity and other missions after they had withdrawn from the frontlines around Tripoli after Russian President Vladimir Putin had denied that Russians were on the ground in Libya.

The website reports the source as saying that leaders within Haftar's forces had been in constant disputes with Russian Wagner Group mercenaries, especially after the latest offensive of the Government of National Accord's forces on the western region cities alongside the coastline, which led to Haftar's loss of seven cities in 24 hours and showed the inefficiency of Wagner Group mercenaries.

""Wagner Group has been bringing lately fighters - not so experienced - from Syria, Belarus and Serbia. This came after the Russia-Turkey agreement and after Putin refuted that Russians were fighting in Libya.""

According to confidential letters by a Panel of Experts, under the Security Council's Libya Sanctions Committee, the sale of at least $18 million in military equipment was made through a Jordan-based company that was founded by Fulcrum Holding in the UAE.

Anadolu Agency added that a source familiar with the letters, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the committee got a tipoff in mid-January that the UAE was trying to fund a special team of mercenaries to back Haftar.

The International Labor Organization estimates the loss of more than 25 million jobs and US$ 3.4 trillion losses in labor income.

It is expected that the COVID-19 crisis will hit developing countries harder with income losses exceeding $220 billion and nearly half of all jobs in Africa lost. An effective response must be driven by solidarity, science and human rights, whilst focusing on the most vulnerable people.

For the United Nations, and for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in particular, the facts about poverty, climate change, inequality, and conflicts around the world are relevant to the whole of humanity. For this reason, we have been listening to people and experts and working to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.

Impact on education, human rights and, in the most severe cases, basic food security and nutrition, is expected due to the coronavirus crisis, especially for the estimated 55 per cent of the global population with no access to social protection.

It is important to keep in mind that total number of confirmed cases do not provide a total accurate picture as like in the case of Libya there are gaps for testing capacity to identify COVID-19.

Furthermore, the need to respond to the current global health crisis only adds to the protracted security, political and economic crises. People in Libya live in permanent uncertainty and fear, as open conflict continues.

This new challenge comes to under-resourced hospitals and a fragile health systems, plus poor urban planning, the weak waste disposal services, and even traffic congestion impeding quick access to healthcare facilities.

For years, UNDP, as well as other UN agencies, have been supporting public institutions, local governments, civil society and communities in Libya to achieve stabilization, resilience and recovery, and contributing to shaping the conditions for peace and social cohesion in the west, east and south of the country.

Nowadays, UNDP, in coordination with public institutions and the United Nations, is responding to the Covid-19 crisis helping Libya in three ways:

The first is supporting national and local institutions to strengthen their health systems. With support from 13 international partners, our Stabilization Facility for Libya, and with funds from the European Union, our Resilience programme, continue supporting all three regions of Libya with provision of health infrastructure, health waste management, and water and sanitation equipment.

We are providing key strategic health infrastructure and medical equipment; upgrade capacities for local production of protection gear; help the Ministry of Health to build isolation rooms in hospitals and clinics, as well as provide technical assistance to design medical oxygen plants and procure urgent inputs like hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and corona virus test kits.

We are supporting Ministry of Justice to prevent and control COVID-19 in prisons.

We are also working with the Libya Accelerator Lab, part of a UNDP global network, to apply innovative ways and tools to support the COVID-19 response engaging key national and local actors for facilitating access to assistance to all and more effective actions.

The second is setting up a whole-of society response bringing all local and national authorities, civil society and private sector around the table. In Libya, this will include strengthening institutions for governance and crisis management at national and local level; and raising awareness on the exposure and precautions against the virus through a network of communication officers of municipalities in the South, West, and East of the country.

UNDP keeps supporting UNSMIL, so Libya can move forward with the Berlin peace process and pave the way for a comprehensive political solution, despite the constraints determined by the threat of the virus.

From Libya, we are hosting online reconciliation forums, and advocating in support of the call for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world issued by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, to fight the common enemy, COVID-19. We are supporting a group of 100 peace mediators from all corners of Libya spreading their word online: #unitedagainstcorona #peacenowstopcorona.

The third is addressing the socio-economic and human rights impacts of COVID-19 and safeguarding progress towards achieving the SDGs, including addressing stigma and discrimination arising from its spread and supporting marginalized people and vulnerable populations. In Libya, we will assess capacities and planning for long term inclusive development with especial focus on most vulnerable groups; implement special measures for those whose livelihoods are most affected; and conduct communication and advocacy campaigns engaging with civil society and community-based organizations at the local level to prevent discrimination.

Within the UN system coordinated response in Libya, we are working to ensure that no one is left behind, that we support preparation, management and recovery of this crisis and develop capacities for prevention in the longer term, and that we continue making progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Ministry said the statement that these five countries included falsehoods and open abuse, aimed against the sovereignty of the Libyan state, stressing in a statement on Monday, that it was specifically aimed against the memorandums signed between Libya and Turkey.

It expressed its surprise at the UAE's input in the statement, which was issued on Monday, noting that it is not, in fact, a Mediterranean country to assume the right to suggest goals or objectives regarding Libya, this likely prompted it to join hands with other countries with similar agendas against the GNA.

The Ministry explained that the Libyan-Turkish deal was signed according to international conventions and does not impinge on the rights of any third party, adding that Libya announced, at the time of signing, its willingness to negotiate or clarify the aims of the agreement.

It also took into full consideration, any claim of suffering as a result, whilst retaining the right of resorting to these measures, just as Malta and Tunisia have done in similar cases.

The Ministry stressed that the aforementioned states are in fact members of the United Nations, which fully recognizes the GNA as the only legitimate government in Libya, adding that the memorandum was signed, in effect, by an internationally recognized government, in accordance with its national sovereignty.

""Any objection or scepticism regarding this matter violates the national sovereignty of the Libyan State and all credibility of the governments of these countries, both internationally and in the eyes of their own people, has been shattered, having falsified major facts, in order to serve their own goals in the region.""

The newspaper said on Tuesday that the Russians are acting out on US strategic interests in North Africa, but at the same time, doing it at a low cost, because if they mess up, then the Kremlin has plausible deniability.

The US official told Washington Examiner that it is really about access in Libya for Russia and about having access to the ports, to the oil, as well as having a reason to be in the Eastern Mediterranean.

""When we talk about Russia, we have to be specific that it's really the military contractors from Russia, the Wagner Group are there, and it's really not the Russian government, the Russian military, that is in Libya."" The official explained.

He added that when Russia is pressed by the United Nations on their influence and impact in Libya, they would be quick to say that they are not really present there.

Since the U.S. departure from Libya following Haftar's attack on Tripoli in April 2019, Russia has been strengthening its military partnership in Libya, said Kimberly Marten, chairwoman of the political science department at Barnard College, speaking at a Center for Strategic and International Studies forum Tuesday.

""There have been reports that they are people who are sharpshooters,"" she said of the elite Wagner mercenaries operating on behalf of Haftar in Libya, adding that they have really been the pointy end of the stick, making a big difference in what Haftar is able to do.

Another defense official told the American newspaper that the Russian private military contractor, referring to Wagner Group, has been in Libya and other parts of the African continent since early 2018.

AFRICOM Navy Lt. Christina Gibson told the Washington Examiner in a statement that the command sees Russia increasingly using private military contractors for military training and security assistance, which offers Moscow greater flexibility to achieve its geopolitical and economic goals.

A senior defense official said if the US didn't have a military presence in Libya - in a partner-building capacity or whatever - it would be put really far behind.

The senior defense official added: ""From a military perspective, going back in would allow us to be engaged in training, as well as some US influence on the activities within the government of Libya, as well as allows us to keep track of ISIS Libya and other groups.""

Libya, home to Africa's largest crude oil reserves, has been wracked by war and lawlessness since a 2011 revolt that toppled former dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi, and the country's once-robust electricity network is in tatters. Poor maintenance, a shortage of fuel at generating plants, and a blockade stopping oil exports have stretched the power grid to breaking point. Climate change only adds to the pressure.

Hundreds of protesters have marched daily in Tripoli to vent their fury about half-day-long power cuts and other government failings. Last week's marchers, most of them young men, filled darkened streets, chanting: ""No lights, no water, we're fed up!""

Mass protests are rare in Libya, and these outbursts are rocking the delicate political balance in the capital. One person was injured on Aug. 23 in the first day of demonstrations, and authorities called a curfew to try to contain them and the virus. Libya's presidential council suspended its interior minister on Friday for allegedly encouraging the protesters.

Libya Security Chief Suspended in Escalating Power Struggle

The latest phase in the country's civil war brought more blackouts. Military commander Khalifa Haftar and his forces advanced on Tripoli in April 2019, determined to unseat the United Nations-backed government based there. Although he withdrew in June after failing to capture the western city, the fighting damaged transmission lines and control stations.

Looters stripped high-voltage cables from power poles during Haftar's siege, according to an official at the state-run General Electricity Co. of Libya, known as Gecol. Output nationwide has declined for five years and now meets only about 60% of peak summer demand, the official said, asking not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak to media.

Gecol says it must wait for demand to ease in the cooler autumn and winter months before doing maintenance work.

""We can't afford to undergo any servicing for the generation units,"" said Naje Abu Zoqia, head of the South Tripoli power station. ""We're in desperate need of every megawatt.""

One potential source of help is Karadeniz Holding AS, a Turkish company that's in talks with Libya's government to sell 1,000 megawatts from floating power stations. Turkey, a staunch supporter of the leadership in Tripoli, is seeking business opportunities amid the conflict.

Cash, however, is running out. Haftar's supporters have shut down ports and other oil facilities, curbing exports and depriving the nation of its main source of income. Crude production has plummeted to 90,000 barrels a day, a fraction of the 1.2 million the OPEC member pumped in January.

Even Haftar's power base in eastern Libya is paying a price. The National Oil Corp. warned last week that the blockade, which also affects the gas produced at oil fields, will lead to worsening blackouts in the east. Gas supplies to power stations in the cities of Benghazi and Zueitina have dropped to 160 million cubic feet per day from 250 million and will probably halt completely, the NOC said.

To ease the eastern electricity crisis, Haftar's supporters earlier this month allowed a partial resumption of oil shipments. A Suezmax tanker arrived at the port in Brega on Sunday to load 600,000 barrels for Vienna-based OMV AG, and another is expected Thursday.

No Quick End to Libya Strife After Haftar Derides Cease-Fire

Libyans are taking matters into their own hands. As in Iraq and Lebanon, businesses and wealthier residents pay for private generators to cool their homes, shops and offices, and the gasoline engines of these machines rumble ceaselessly in many of Tripoli's neighborhoods.

The poor have little choice but to endure the heat -- a sign of how climate change may already be widening social and economic disparities in the Middle East and beyond.

Alarif Hameeda has had a blockbuster summer selling 3,000 Chinese-made generators, his entire inventory, in less than two months. Last year -- before Haftar's offensive shattered the grid -- he sold fewer than 1,000, he said from his shop in the city.

To minimize blackouts, Gecol tries to rotate power among towns. But armed men frequently storm its facilities, demanding that engineers restore electricity to their areas.

This can lead to bigger cuts and even crash the network. The grid collapsed three times early this month, causing blackouts across southern and western Libya, said Abu Zoqia of South Tripoli station.

The agreement, which lays out the boundary between the two nations' exclusive economic zones, will allow Athens and Cairo to secure maximum benefits from oil and natural gas in the area, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said in a televised press conference with his Greek counterpart, Nikolaos Dendias.

The deal comes as Turkey is looking to issue new energy exploration licenses in the eastern Mediterranean, a move sharply criticized by Greece and the European Union. In addition, Turkish support for the internationally recognized, Tripoli-based Libyan Government of National Accord has upped the stakes in the war-ravaged North African nation.

Egypt, which is backing eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, has said Turkey is supporting terrorists and militias that pose a national security risk for Cairo.

The agreement comes as tensions between Athens and Ankara flared up recently after Turkey said it would send a seismic research vessel into an area south of the coastal city of Antalya and the Greek island of Kastellorizo, which both countries say falls into their respective continental shelves. Ankara since said it will hold off on the survey to give time for diplomacy.

11400429,2020-05-05,"New report cites role of as many as 1,200 Russian forces Libya has been torn by fighting since Qaddafi's 2011 killing

Russian operatives are engaged in a large-scale effort in Libya to bolster eastern commander Khalifa Haftar through a mix of technical support, direct involvement in combat operations and sophisticated influence campaigns, according to United Nations experts.

About 800 to 1,200 mercenaries from the Wagner group -- headed by a confidant of President Vladimir Putin -- have been actively operating in Libya since 2018, including at least 39 Russian snipers on the front lines, the UN experts monitoring sanctions on the North African country wrote in their first extensive report on mercenaries, which was viewed by Bloomberg.

Libya, which has Africa's largest oil reserves, has been all but ungovernable since a NATO-backed rebellion led to the 2011 killing of Moammar Qaddafi, who had ruled the country for more than 40 years. In recent years, an internationally recognized government based in Tripoli has been mired in conflict with Haftar's forces.

Haftar, 76, launched his campaign to take Tripoli last year just as the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the city to lay the groundwork for a conference meant to reunite the divided country.

The Russian deployment has further complicated international efforts to end the conflict in Libya. The United Arab Emirates had already entered the conflict on Haftar's behalf, while Turkey has been assisting the government.

The panel also pointed out that in addition to Turkey's recruitment of thousands of Syrian fighters to prop up the UN-backed government, as many as 2,000 Syrians have likely been flown into Libya by Damascus-based Cham Wings Airlines to back the Haftar side in yet a new phase of the escalating proxy battle.

A Wagner-linked entity engaged in a ""highly sophisticated and extensive social media campaign"" to support Haftar and his ground operations, the panel noted, adding that ""psychological operations"" are prohibited under the UN arms embargo. A similar effort was undertaken to support Saif Al-Islam Qaddafi, the son and heir apparent of the late dictator.

The report also indicated strains in the relationship between Russia and Haftar, with Moscow meeting most of Haftar's requests while his responses have frequently been ""less than amicable."" Haftar has restricted Wagner movements and the information available to them while keeping them out of the decision-making process, it added.

The UN panel published copies of a Russian-language map showing a training camp which it said was established by Russian mercenaries in southeastern Libya in late 2019. It also published images of people who were said to be Russian mercenaries in Libya and detailed specific types of weapons, such as the VOG-25 40mm grenade, which have been used by Wagner operatives in eastern Ukraine and Syria.

While the panel is still investigating the presence of Syrian fighters in Libya, it cited reports that Syrians in the town of Douma were being recruited on an $800 monthly salary and mentioned ""credible"" open source reports on Russian efforts to recruit Syrian fighters.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Russia', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine']","Russian Mercenaries Act as 'Force Multiplier' in Libya, UN Says",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-05/russian-mercenaries-act-as-force-multiplier-in-libya-un-says,None,
11400430,2020-04-30,"Libyan militia commander Khalifa Haftar ordered his forces to freeze operations during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, as criticism mounts over his bid to consolidate power in the oil-rich east.

The cessation is a response to international calls for a humanitarian reprieve for the war-ravaged nation, Ahmed al-Mismari, spokesman for Haftar's Libyan National Army, said late Wednesday in a televised briefing. Haftar has been waging a campaign to seize the capital, Tripoli, from the internationally recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj for over a year.

While Haftar has largely brushed aside repeated international attempts to broker an end to fighting, his forces, which control the OPEC member's east and south, have suffered a series of losses around Tripoli in recent weeks. Backed by Turkey, Sarraj's Government of National Accord has seized key western towns from Haftar, who's supported by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russian mercenaries.

The GNA hasn't directly responded to Haftar's announcement, and fighters loyal to it on Thursday said they'd launched an attack on Haftar's forces on the outskirts of Tarhouna, a city south of Tripoli that's one of his final bastions in the area, Libya Al-Ahrar TV reported.

Haftar is facing an international backlash after this week ditching a 2015 political agreement that created the Presidency Council headed by Sarraj and the advisory State Council while allowing for the continuation of the rival legislature in the eastern city of Tobruk.

Haftar also said he was accepting a popular call from Libyans to rule directly -- a move interpreted by many as a soft coup against the eastern parliament that helped elevate him to power.

""Haftar's decision to formalize his direct control of eastern Libya is a sign of his rising desperation in the face of GNA successes"" in the country's west, Hamish Kinnear, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a report this week.

""By sweeping aside the authority of the House of Representatives and electing himself as undisputed leader in the east, Haftar is making himself central to any negotiated solution to the civil war.""

Libya's Haftar Dealt Setback in Fighting West of Tripoli

Libya has been crippled by turmoil since the 2011 NATO-backed ouster and killing of Moammar Qaddafi. Political wrangling and conflict has left Libyans struggling to survive and triggered a 90% plunge in oil production, the country's chief source of foreign revenue. Both sides have been accused of flouting cease-fires and ignoring an arms embargo, according to the United Nations.

There's already been international fallout from Haftar's moves in the east. The U.S. and France have criticized what they described as an attempt to reshape the political framework and urged an adherence to internationally brokered efforts to end the conflict.

Mismari said Wednesday that the LNA would issue a constitutional declaration laying out the coming political blueprint. He didn't provide details.

In dismissing the 2015 deal and saying he would lead, Haftar has created rifts in the east. He ignored a political roadmap outlined by Agila Saleh, head of the Tobruk-based parliament, that called for the reshaping of the ruling Presidency Council -- a bid that offered a compromise approach to ending the conflict and mending the country's fault lines.

The Obeidat tribe, the largest in the east and from which Saleh hails, said in a statement Wednesday that while it supported the LNA's fight against ""terrorism"" and opposed Turkish interference in Libya, it saw Haftar as a military commander rather than the leader of a nation.

11400458,2020-03-20,"""Putin's chef"" has been linked to a secret attempt to bring the deposed dictator's son to power.

On an April day last year, as war raged around Tripoli, two Russian operatives set out from the Libyan capital to meet the man they hoped to install as leader.

Saif Al-Islam Qaddafi, the son and heir apparent of deposed dictator Colonel Moammar Al Qaddafi, had been holed up in an area around the Zintan plateau ever since his father was killed in a 2011 rebellion. A fugitive from the International Criminal Court, he was planning to claim what he saw as his rightful place.

Along came Maxim Shugaley, a veteran Saint Petersburg elections consultant, and his translator and colleague, Samir Seifan, with an offer to help make that happen. Russian polling showed that after years of civil war, nostalgia for the old regime was strong: Saif Al-Islam was among Libya's most popular politicians.

This account of their meetings is based on notes taken by the Russians and seen by Bloomberg News after they were arrested in Tripoli. Some records of Russian involvement in Libya were separately published by The Daily Beast in collaboration with the Dossier Center and Russian news site Proekt. Those seen by Bloomberg contain information that has not previously been revealed about interactions with Saif Al-Islam, now 47.

The documents shed light on Russia's apparent efforts to build influence in the oil-rich North African state at a time of U.S. disengagement.

The April get-together was the Russians' last of at least three meetings with Qaddafi's son that year, according to Libyan officials, and he was brimming with plans. Saif Al-Islam wanted them to pass a message to Moscow that he had compromising material on Western politicians showing they'd received campaign contributions from his family. He proposed that together they ""think about how this information could be used,"" one of the Russians noted in a memo at the time.

But the consultants weren't there to discuss ""kompromat,"" a term for damaging material about a person that could be used for blackmail, extortion or public embarrassment. They had bigger things in mind.

Libya, which has Africa's largest oil reserves, has been all but ungovernable since a violent NATO-backed rebellion led to the killing of Qaddafi, who ruled the country for more than 40 years, enjoying warm relations with Moscow even as the West wavered between engaging and isolating the erratic dictator.

Almost eight years on from his ouster, the Russian consultants had been dispatched to plan the return of the Qaddafi regime.

The Kremlin had long thought about how it could maneuver its way back into Libya. Qaddafi's downfall sidelined Moscow, leaving Italy, France and regional powers seeking the spoils while rival Libyan factions fought one civil war after another.

Moscow's official line is that it works with all parties in Libya. Initially, Russia's government kept contacts with both sides of the civil war while promoting Saif Al-Islam as a future president. By September of last year, however, Russia shifted to flat-out support for Khalifa Haftar, a rebel strongman who controls the east of the country, despite misgivings about his past connections to the U.S. and legendary unpredictability.

Russia's Defense Ministry had maintained connections with Haftar for years, even hosting him aboard a Russian aircraft carrier off the Libyan coast in 2017. But different actors close to power in Russia have their own ideas of whom to back and how to support them.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, an insider also known as ""Putin's chef,"" reckoned Saif Al-Islam could be a good bet for an investment in the country, according to three people familiar with his thinking. That was despite war-crimes charges against Saif Al-Islam and the fact he was in hiding.

A former restaurateur who found favor with President Vladimir Putin, Prigozhin branched out from catering into the mercenary business; he's best known as boss of the Wagner private security company, which has sent fighters and political consultants to Ukraine, Syria and Libya, among other hotspots.

In 2018, he was indicted by a grand jury in the U.S. for his companies' alleged role in trying to sway the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors have now dropped the charges against Prigozhin's company, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, although the allegations against him remain. Prigozhin has not entered a plea. Concord didn't respond to requests for comment on Prigozhin's alleged Libyan engagements. However, in a March 17 statement, Prigozhin said the dropped charges showed that the U.S. government ""feared publicity and just court proceedings"" and the allegations were ""mendacious and false.""

As Bloomberg reported last year, digital documents collected from Shugaley and Seifan after their arrest linked them to a so-called troll farm, or digital propaganda and disinformation company, connected to Prigozhin. They also showed the company had been in touch with Saif Al-Islam.

""Saif Al-Islam is Prigozhin's project,"" said Kirill Semenov, a Libya expert at the Kremlin-funded Russian International Affairs Council. But others in the Kremlin had doubts about him, he said.

By the start of 2019, Libya had been divided between a United Nations-recognized but weak government led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in the West including Tripoli, while field marshal Haftar held sway in the east and the south. In April, Haftar decided to seize the capital.

Haftar's offensive on Tripoli faltered despite backing from the U.A.E., dragging the warring sides into a stalemate in the city's suburbs. Wagner dispatched more than 1,400 mercenaries, but the move ultimately backfired because the desperate government in Tripoli turned to Turkey for military help, altering the balance of power in the conflict.

Haftar's spokesman Ahmed Al-Mismari has denied that Russian mercenaries are fighting alongside his forces, but acknowledged there were Russian teams deployed to the east to help with maintenance of aircraft and weapons. Putin has publicly distanced himself from the mercenaries, saying that even if they were in Libya, they had nothing to do with the Russian government. A spokesman for the Kremlin didn't respond to a request for comment. Haftar's spokesman didn't respond either.

Moscow's strategy of betting on multiple horses in Libya has hit headwinds before. In late 2018, Russia facilitated a phone call between the field marshal and Saif Al-Islam to try and get them on the same page, according to three people familiar with the conversation. It didn't go well.

In his meetings with the Russian consultants, Qaddafi's son made no secret of his contempt for Haftar.

""Eighty percent of those fighting on the side of Haftar are my people,"" he told them, according to the Russians' records of the meetings. ""When he takes over Tripoli, the people he considers his own will change sides. I know he wants to kill me, but he won't be able to make that happen.""

Saif Al-Islam predicted that elections would eventually take place whether or not Haftar won the war -- and that he and not Haftar would come out on top. But first, he also sought some Russian assistance, according to the notes seen by Bloomberg.

At one meeting, they discussed training consultants in neighboring Tunisia, and building up a group of ""specialists"" who would distribute messages over social media. ""He's very interested in counter-propaganda,"" the Russians noted.

They presented him with a slide show, entitled, ""Saif Qaddafi. Revival of Libya. Strategy."" It laid out steps for him to either become a candidate or support a leader in exchange for a role in a new government. The Russian plan including organizing a ""flash mob"" of the Libyan community in The Hague. The slogan: ""Safe with Saif.""

The Hague is home to the International Criminal Court, which issued warrants for Saif Al-Islam and his father in 2011 for crimes against humanity including murder and persecution. Libya challenged the admissibility of the case against Saif Al-Islam, which the court rejected in 2013. In 2015, in a trial of former regime officials, a Tripoli court sentenced Saif Al-Islam to death in absentia. Hours later, lawmakers for the UN-backed government in Libya passed an amnesty for some crimes committed after the uprising.

At their final meeting in April as covered in the notes, Saif Al-Islam promised to provide a list of military commanders loyal to him, and to make arrangements to receive personnel from what the Russians described in the memo as ""our Sudanese company,"" according to the files seized by the Libyans.

Shugaley and Seifan headed back to their Tripoli apartment, and were arrested soon after. A third Russian, Alexander Prokofiev, attended one of the meetings with Saif Al-Islam, according to the notes seized by prosecutors, but left the country before the others were arrested. In a phone interview, Prokofiev said he and the others were in Libya to conduct political research, and denied they acted as consultants to Qaddafi's son. ""These are all far-fetched theories,"" he said. Saif Al-Islam was just ""one of our respondents.""

Prokofiev denied any links to Prigozhin, saying he worked for the Foundation for the Defense of National Values. The Moscow-based organization is headed by Alexander Malkevich, a former editor-in-chief of the USA Really news website, which is part of a media group that the U.S. linked to Prigozhin in its sanctions designation. Malkevich has also been targeted for U.S. sanctions for alleged involvement in elections interference.

In a statement, Malkevich's Moscow-based organization said it had employed the two consultants in Libya but denied they were there to meddle in elections. The group made public its research, including opinion polls showing Haftar and Saif Al-Islam as Libya's two most popular potential politicians, without mentioning consultancy work for Saif Al-Islam.

An aide to Saif Al-Islam confirmed he had met with the Russian consultants. He wanted good relations with Western countries too, but the Russians offered their help first, the aide said.

The two Russians are being held in a prison at Tripoli's Mitiga airport, which also houses former senior regime officials and Islamist militants. The duo are accused of espionage and seeking to interfere in future elections. When contacted by Bloomberg, a lawyer for the detainees declined to comment.

Russia has privately campaigned for their release. Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov has raised the issue with Libyan leaders, so far without success, according to people familiar with the matter.

Malkevich took out an ad in the Washington Post demanding the Russians' freedom.

Turkey is seeking to mend relations with traditional western allies and regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia as rifts with Russia, Joe Biden's U.S. election victory and the threat of European sanctions force a foreign-policy rethink, people familiar with the discussions said.

After he was sworn in with sweeping executive power more than two years ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a high-stakes pivot away from the pursuit of closer ties with the West. Turkey veered closer to Moscow, alienating and antagonizing fellow members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Recent events have changed the calculus, the people said.

Ankara's interests are increasingly at odds with those of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Russia and Turkey were on opposite sides in Libya's war before a truce was agreed, and have clashing aims in Syria's conflict. Turkey then muscled into Russia's Caucasus backyard with its support for Azerbaijan in the 44-day war with Armenian forces over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Then there's the U.S., where President Donald Trump, who declared his personal rapport with Erdogan even while they quarreled, is leaving the White House. And in Europe, leaders are set to discuss penalizing Turkey for its unilateral energy exploration in contested waters of the Mediterranean at a European Union meeting starting Dec. 10.

Sanctions would imperil Turkey's economic recovery from pandemic restrictions just weeks after a new team of top officials began attempts to get to grips with a collapsing currency.

Erdogan Gets Ready for a Rocky Four Years With Biden in Office

Erdogan is sounding conciliatory. ""We don't have issues with any country or institution that cannot be solved through politics, dialogue and negotiation,"" he said on Sunday as he urged the EU to help overcome obstacles holding up Turkey's bid to join the bloc and abide by agreements on customs and visa-free travel. ""We express the same wish in relations with our ally America.""

Officials have hinted that Turkey, in a bid to avert U.S. punishments, would ring-fence from NATO systems the Russian-made S-400 air-defense missiles it bought and tested. Erdogan has sent his envoy to Brussels to de-escalate tensions with the EU.

Still, repairing ties also roiled by western support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and U.S. charges against a major Turkish bank for sanctions-busting, won't be straightforward.

Biden last December derided Erdogan as an autocrat and pledged to bolster his domestic opposition, while Ankara's military cooperation with Russia alarmed NATO powers who can be expected to drive a hard bargain before again fully embracing Turkey. Turkey's drilling for gas in the Mediterranean has upset Greece and Cyprus, and Erdogan has rowed with French President Emmanuel Macron over the latter's comments on Islam.

Trump suspended Turkey from helping build the F-35 fighter jet after the Russian missile deal, yet Congress is pushing for harsher penalties. It's considering legislation that would force the president to impose sanctions on Turkey for flirting militarily with Moscow.

According to the people who discussed Turkey's change of heart, Ankara believes Biden's enduring faith in multinational institutions and transatlantic ties will help it repair damage with NATO partners and improve the likelihood of long-sought weapons deals. Turkey's footprint in Middle East battle zones boosts the alliance's ability to contain an expansionist Russia, they said.

Turkey wants to develop its defense industry, preferably through production of tanks, missiles and warplanes with NATO allies. It's pushing Canada to end its export ban on some drone technology, the people said, and wants France to agree joint production of Eurosam missiles. Russia has so far failed to deliver on expectations it would transfer technology used in the advanced S-400 or undertake joint production, they said. Similar demands by Turkey blighted its efforts to secure U.S.-made Patriot missiles.

Erdogan separately used a phone call with Saudi Arabian monarch Salman bin Abdulaziz to express his desire to heal ties with the kingdom, the people said. The countries' relations neared collapse after Saudi agents murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Gulf kingdom's leadership, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

Turkey, which charged two top aides to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for ordering the killing, has done all it can to shed light on the murder, but it's now time to focus on bilateral issues, the people said.

11400535,2020-11-10,"Adipec, one of the biggest energy events in the Middle East and North Africa, is into its second day. Usually hosted in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, this year's conference is virtual.

Energy ministers from Egypt, Jordan and Iraq are among those speaking on Tuesday. So is Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency.

The event, which runs until Nov. 12, opened on Monday with oil prices under under pressure from an acceleration in coronavirus cases in major economies and new lockdowns in Europe. But crude prices soared late Monday as Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE reported a potential Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough. Benchmark Brent crude is trading around 10% higher this week near $43 a barrel.

Here are the latest developments, updated throughout the day. (Time-stamps are local time in Abu Dhabi.)

Jordan expects to double natural gas production within a year, Energy Minister Hala Zawati said, without specifying volumes. The country is also working to improve international electricity links, mainly with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and the Palestinian Territories, she said.

Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said it was misleading for anyone to claim that oil demand had already peaked. If economies recover from the pandemic quickly, consumption of crude could rise above pre-Covid levels, he said. In a separate interview with Bloomberg TV, he said President-elect Joe Biden will strongly push renewable energy in the U.S. -- especially solar and wind. Solar is now the cheapest source of power in most of the world, according to Birol.

Vitol Group, the world's largest independent oil trader, sees a ""difficult few months ahead"" for crude demand, but it expects prices to recover around the middle of next year to between the high $40s and $50 per barrel, Chief Executive Officer Russell Hardy said. Drawdowns of global oil inventories will quicken into the second quarter, assuming that OPEC+ delays its plan to ease output cuts in January. The Biden presidency will be bullish for oil, due to higher costs of capital and more regulation of fracking in the U.S. The potential return of Iranian crude to the market is an issue for the second half of 2021, he said.

Abu Dhabi's state energy firm Adnoc and ADQ, one of the emirate's investment vehicles, announced a joint venture to grow the chemicals industry in the United Arab Emirates. They will instigate projects in the planned Ruwais Derivatives Park that will potentially lead to more than $5 billion of investments, the firms said in a statement.

Egypt plans to increase the number of cars running on compressed natural gas by 260,000 in the next three years, Oil Minister Tarek El-Molla said. There are currently 330,000 vehicles in the North African country that use CNG, he said. The government's previously said the push will not only reduce carbon emissions, but Egyptians' fuel bills too.

Oil will probably range between $40 and $45 per barrel next year, Eni SpA Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi said. Prices can improve as economies recover from the coronavirus. Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s CEO Vicki Hollub said improving demand could cause prices to spike from mid-2022.

Total SE expects oil use to peak in or around 2030, Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said. The timing of the transition away from crude oil will depend on energy demand. Some deepwater projects can still be approved and carried out in the current environment, in Brazil, for example. Total sees opportunities in the U.S. for both gas and renewables, he said.

Energy demand in India has almost recovered to pre-Covid levels, and that trend will continue in coming months, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. He also laid out plans for India to boost renewable energy use and become a ""gas-less economy"" in the coming decades. Thailand is sticking with and enhancing its use of natural gas for now, Energy Minister Supattanapong Punmeechaow said. The Southeast Asian country is trying to secure better access to the fuel by enhancing trade networks with gas producers, he said.

OPEC+ will be able to cope with an increase in Iranian supply, if U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden were to strike a deal with Tehran, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman said. The coalition has managed supply challenges before, as it has done with Libya's rising output, he said. ""It is a safe bet"" to wager on the resilience of OPEC+, he said.

OPEC is continually revising upward its demand forecast for next year and currently sees consumption rising by 6.5 million barrels a day, the group's secretary-general, Mohammad Barkindo, said.

The OPEC+ group is able to adjust output cuts as needed, and all members of the group would need to agree to do so, UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said. The UAE is addressing past over-production; it's committed to adhering 100% to the cuts deal, including in September and October, he said.

OPEC and allied producers can tweak their output-cuts deal as needed, the Saudi energy minister said. They're taking a pro-active role, staying flexible and watching the oil market, which is stable despite new coronavirus lockdowns, he said. ""With the consensus of everybody, we could navigate with this agreement and tweak"" it, depending on what they see in the future, he said.

Libya's daily crude output has reached 800,000 barrels per day and the country is targeting 1.3 million barrels at the beginning 2021, according to Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of state-run National Oil Corp.

The reopening of the last of Libya's oil fields and ports has prompted a resurgence of the energy industry, with the OPEC nation's daily production jumping from less than 100,000 barrels in early September.

""We're very interested in coordinating with our colleagues in OPEC,"" Sanalla said in an interview Saturday. ""We're interested in achieving a balance in terms of supply and demand."" Libya's share in OPEC is 1.7 million barrels daily.

The National Oil Corp. expects the country to pump 1 million barrels daily next month, Sanalla said. Its ambition to reach 1.6 million by the end of 2021 hinges on the resources the Finance Ministry will allocate to the company, he said.

Erdogan Signals Libya 'Agreement' With U.S. After Trump Call

Turkey is supporting the internationally recognized government in Tripoli against Kremlin-backed eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar, who also gets assistance from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, without elaborating, that a deal with the U.S. over Libya was likely following his phone call on Monday with President Donald Trump.

The Trump administration has not objected to Erdogan's military intervention in Libya, which if resolved to his satisfaction, would deal a setback to Russia. It has adopted a hands-off policy regarding Libya and sent mixed signals, officially supporting the government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj even as Trump undermined the premier with a phone call to Haftar last year.

On Thursday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey and the U.S. were sounding each other out on their respective Libya policies as the conversation between their leaders indicated a growing overlap. Turkey's entry into the war several months ago, including the supply of armed drones to Sarraj's forces, has turned the tide against Haftar, who had launched an offensive on the capital 14 months ago.

""The U.S. is not very active in Libya probably because of traumatic incidents,"" Cavusoglu told NTV television in an interview, referring to the killing of the American ambassador in Benghazi in 2012. ""Both NATO and the U.S. should play a more active role in Libya for the stability"" of the country and the region, he said.

Two days after speaking with Trump, Erdogan discussed Libya with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Cavusoglu said Turkey's tensions with Egypt have deepened since Cairo sided with Haftar, without saying whether the presence of Russian mercenaries in the ranks of Haftar forces was causing a rift in ties with Moscow as well.

Commenting on Haftar's battlefield losses, the minister claimed that ""some tribes and clans are speedily changing sides to support Sarraj.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Turkey', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Russia', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Benghazi', 'Moscow', 'Cairo']",Turkey Urges U.S. to Step Up in Libya as Strongman Loses Ground,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/turkey-urges-u-s-to-step-up-in-libya-as-strongman-loses-ground,None,
11400560,2020-02-06,"When Turkey's military waged an air and artillery blitz that slaughtered dozens of Russian-allied Syrian troops this week in retaliation for an assault that killed seven of its soldiers, Moscow offered barely a murmur of protest.

The worst tensions between Moscow and Ankara since the 2015 downing of a Russian warplane by Turkish fighter jets are testing the marriage of convenience between Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan as they jostle for dominance in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean. The Kremlin's unusually muted response also shows how the balance may have shifted in the delicate relationship between the two presidents.

It continued even as Ankara dismissed arguments that Russia doesn't control Syrian government forces in the northwestern Idlib province as an ""excuse,"" and after Erdogan bluntly informed Putin in a phone conversation that Turkey would react ""in the harshest way"" to any future attacks on its forces.

""It's hard for Putin to work with Erdogan, who strongly irritates him, but he hasn't got any choice,"" said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin adviser. ""Russia cannot operate in the Middle East if it's in conflict with Turkey, otherwise it'll face major problems.""

After centuries of rivalry dating to the Ottoman and Russian empires, Russia and Turkey view their recent partnership as a key tool for achieving strategic goals amid declining U.S. influence in the region. It's also a source of lucrative energy and arms deals. Yet despite heading the larger power, Putin arguably has fewer means to restrain Erdogan, who can leverage Turkey's ties with the U.S. to gain room to maneuver with Russia.

The widening rift over Syria, where they back opposing sides but are cooperating to try to halt the war, is matched in Libya. A Turkish military intervention earlier this year frustrated a Russian-backed military leader's drive to capture the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

Putin is biting his tongue even as Erdogan on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to pull back forces fighting in Idlib with Russian air support by the end of this month.

""We would not want to see our strategic relationship with Russia deteriorate over Syria,"" said a senior Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""But of course, our priority is our own national interests.""

Turkey's relationship with Russia has reached its most difficult point in years and appears to be getting worse, another senior Turkish official said.

The increase in tensions follows the remarkable rapprochement since relations plunged into crisis over the downing of the Russian warplane near the Syrian border. The 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan triggered efforts to restore ties after Turkey heaped praise on Russia for its support amid criticism of Ankara from the U.S. and allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Putin seized the opportunity to woo Erdogan with the sale of advanced air-defense missile systems that the U.S. refused to supply to its ally, driving a wedge between the nations with NATO's two largest armies. He followed up by offering to sell Erdogan Russia's latest stealth fighter jets after the U.S. suspended Turkey from its F-35 program as punishment for buying the S-400 missile system.

Turkey has lost confidence in the U.S. and doesn't fully trust Russia, though the relationship with Moscow enables Ankara to assert a more independent foreign policy, according to a third senior Turkish official. The S-400 deal opened the way for cooperation with Russia on missile technology in a similar way to the relationship they've developed on nuclear energy, he said.

Russia is determined to maintain its partnership with Turkey after the breakthrough with the $2.5 billion contract to supply the S-400, a senior Russian official said. It's hugely important for Russian security policy to have a key NATO member defying the U.S., the official said.

Russia is building Turkey's first nuclear plant at a cost of $20 billion. It opened the TurkStream pipeline last month to carry natural gas under the Black Sea to Turkey and several countries in southeastern Europe, reducing Moscow's dependence on Ukraine's network. Turkey is currently among the top three buyers of Russian gas.

Still, the potential for conflict is increasing, with Turkey using its military toehold in Idlib to push back against the bid by Assad's forces to recover the only part of Syria outside government control apart from the oil-rich northeast. Turkish military observers are stationed in the area as part of a deal on a Syria buffer zone that Erdogan and Putin struck in October.

Turkey says it fears the Syrian assault may trigger a fresh exodus of refugees across its border from Idlib, which is largely held by fighters allied to al-Qaeda and rebels backed by Ankara. Erdogan has urged Russia to stay out of the fray, while the Kremlin has condemned what it says is ""the continued activity of terrorist groups"" in the province.

Turkey has sought ""to manage a difficult situation together with Russia"" in Idlib, said Mesut Hakki Casin, a law professor at Istanbul's Yeditepe University who is also a member of the security and foreign policy board that advises Erdogan. ""But if the interests of both countries clash then none of them can emerge as a winner.""

Turkey ""wants to avoid attention switching from Idlib to the northeast"" of Syria where it maintains a buffer zone to keep Kurdish forces away from its border, said Andrey Baklanov, a former senior Russian diplomat in the Middle East who's an expert at the Kremlin-backed Valdai discussion club. ""Our patience and that of the Syrians will snap at a certain point.""

Similar tensions are building in Libya. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov complained in an interview to the government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta published Tuesday that hundreds of militants from Idlib have joined the conflict, after Turkey said it would send Syrian rebels to shore up the United Nations-recognized administration of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Turkish soldiers are also training forces loyal to Sarraj.

Lined up against the Turkey-backed forces are hundreds of mercenaries from Russia's Wagner security contractor, which is controlled by Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin. They've been hired to support eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar's now-stalled offensive on Tripoli, according to Western officials and people close to the organization.

In their phone call Tuesday, Putin and Erdogan urged the warring parties in Libya to comply with a cease-fire negotiated by Russia and Turkey last month, and also agreed to ""strengthen the coordination"" of Russian and Turkish activities in Syria, according to a Kremlin statement.

While negotiations on disputes between Russian and Turkish leaders are characterized by mistrust, ""the idea that countries should either be partners on every single front or not at all is an outdated one,"" said Baklanov.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Moscow', 'Ankara', 'Idlib Governorate', 'United States', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Istanbul', 'Ukraine']",Putin Swallows Irritation at Erdogan as Syria Clash Strains Ties,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-06/putin-swallows-irritation-at-erdogan-as-syria-clash-strains-ties,None,
11400761,2020-05-17,"As the pandemic hits African economies, Libya's southern border is getting busier and the alarm bell is ringing in European capitals.

In Libya's vast southern desert, three men have resumed what they call their ""taxi service.""

The passengers aren't tourists or locals. They are mostly young men from neighboring African countries desperate to cross the border and head north toward Europe. And with each ride paying $180 to $250 even as coronavirus wreaks havoc on some of the world's poorest people, it's a business that's still proving as lucrative as ever.

""We don't reduce our fees because those who want to migrate have no other choice,"" said one smuggler based near Sebha, a city in Libya's southwest, 770 kilometers (480 miles) by road from the war-torn capital of Tripoli.

Migration through Libya eased during the height of the pandemic after governments locked down and closed frontiers to curb the spread of the deadly virus. As African economies crater because of disruptions to supply chains and farming, violence and food insecurity are increasing -- and traffickers say people are on the move again. The alarm has already gone off in the European Union.

The EU has invested heavily in keeping arrivals at bay since 2015, when more than a million people mostly fleeing Middle East war zones sought safety. It's paid Turkey to house refugees and given money to the Libyan coastguard. But the political damage has lasted as anti-immigrant populists gained succor across the continent.

Back then, the influx came on the heels of a debt crisis that crippled Greece, the EU's gateway to the east, and the country is still struggling to cope. This time, the coronavirus has put Italy, the main destination for people crossing from Libya, in the spotlight as Europe's soft economic underbelly.

In April, the Italian government declared its ports ""unsafe"" due to the pandemic and said it wouldn't authorize the landing of rescue boats until the end of the emergency.

""In Brussels, the impact of Covid in Africa is something they know they need to address,"" said Camille Le Coz, a policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute Europe. ""The European Commission is preparing for different scenarios. The last migration and refugee crisis in 2015 taught them they need to plan in advance.""

Europe is facing its biggest financial hit since World War II as the virus ripped through the continent and governments confined people to their homes. The U.K., Italy, Spain and France have recorded the most deaths after the U.S. But they also have the money. In Africa, where casualty rates are lower, it's a matter of surviving the economic fallout.

On the edge of the Sahara, the south of Libya is bristling with foreign mercenaries and jihadist groups, and illicit trading of everything from weapons to gold. Those in the business of trafficking humans said they are mostly seeing people from neighboring Chad, Sudan and Niger because the trip costs less. But they are also seeing some trekking from further afield, such as Eritrea, Ghana, Mali and Nigeria.

The three Libyan smugglers interviewed for this story were in their late 30s and early 40s, and hail from the country's south. They spoke on the condition of anonymity.

People paying to transit Libya ""feel that once they reach Europe, their lives will be better than it is in their countries, where their salaries and income is weak,'' said one trafficker. ""In the world and in stable countries, especially Europe, the situation is good,"" said another. ""They have this belief that their arrival means that they will never go to bed hungry.""

One of the men said he recently received a phone call from a contact outside Libya who hadn't been in touch for a long time. After the conversation, he now expects the numbers of new migrants crossing into Libya to increase once tighter border controls in central African countries are loosened.

The drivers said they were busiest in the summers of 2015 and 2016, when they made about 30 trips carrying 20 passengers each time. Last summer, they did only two trips as European efforts to thwart irregular migration started to bear fruit. But the trend is upwards again.

There were 2,800 arrivals in Europe from the central Mediterranean route between Jan. 1 and April 5 this year, five times more than in the same period of 2019, according to EU border agency Frontex. Many of them would have already been stuck in Libya.

People smuggling through the country has generated annual revenues of as much as $1.5 billion, according to an estimate by the International Crisis Group.

The ""taxi service"" meets customers at an agreed point along the Chad-Libya border, a 1,000-kilometer straight line through the red sands of the desert. It's an area that's near impossible to police, so the drivers only really fear rival gangs and Islamist militants. ""We can easily move the meeting point to another spot if we have to,"" said one.

They then travel in groups of a dozen to a western city near the Mediterranean coast. From there another trafficking ring asks for additional fees to ferry the passengers to the water's edge, load them onto boats and direct them across the sea toward European shores. What happens next is simply down to luck.

While just a snapshot of one part of a vast and complicated network, the activity in this regional crossroads is an early indication of the toll that the measures to fight the pandemic are having on sub-Saharan African countries.

QuicktakeEurope's Refugees

EU policy makers are discussing offering humanitarian assistance, building resilience in African health-care systems, and helping economies, said Le Coz in Brussels. There's also a focus on how to compensate for the drop in remittances, the money sent home from successful migrants that's a lifeline to many families.

French President Emmanuel Macron has even called for a moratorium on African debt, saying the continent was already facing unsustainable finances before the pandemic. ""Difficulties will continue to arise even if Covid does not become a health catastrophe,"" he said.

Well before the pandemic there were already plenty of potential migrants in Libya. Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex's executive director, told the European Parliament last month that Covid-19 and Libya's conflict are prompting more people to attempt a crossing. The Libyan coastguard is also having more difficulty stopping them, he said.

Not everyone makes it. Some are arrested and put into Libyan detention camps, others are returned to their point of departure by coastguards. Since the EU ended search and rescue operations, more and more are drowning at sea.

Of course, it's impossible to say how big a new migration flow might be. As Andrew Geddes, director of the Migration Policy Centre at the European University Institute in Florence, put it, there's a misconception ""that the whole African population is sat on its suitcase ready to go to Europe.""

Most African migration takes place within Africa, while there's also a route through Yemen to the Gulf. Researchers say the true picture will only become clear in months to come and they caution against using the word ""wave.""

But some European countries and parties that oppose migration have already started talking about the potential for increased arrivals and the need for more border control.

In Italy, nationalist opposition leader Matteo Salvini has denounced a government plan to give legal status to some 500,000 illegal migrant workers -- many of them in the agricultural sector -- because of the coronavirus emergency. He said ""just the idea"" of legal status ""fosters crime.""

The smugglers say that as long as they have no other means of income, they'll continue their work, and as long as people keep arriving, migrants will keep trying.

""The migrants, especially those who want to go to Europe, follow only good news,'' said one. All they want to know, he said, is ""are there migrants who are managing to reach their destination or not?""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Libya', 'Italy', 'Brussels', 'Sabha, Libya', 'Tripoli', 'United States', 'Turkey', 'Chad', 'Sudan', 'Nigeria', 'Niger', 'Mali', 'Greece', 'Ghana']",Coronavirus Is Proving Lucrative for Some People Traffickers,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-17/coronavirus-is-proving-lucrative-for-some-people-traffickers,None,

The Trump administration stepped up its criticism of Russia's involvement in the Libya conflict, accusing the Kremlin of providing weapons and other support to mercenaries from the Wagner Group and Syrian militias siding with strongman Khalifa Haftar over the UN-recognized government.

Russia is trying to expand its presence along the Mediterranean Sea and in Africa more broadly, and its involvement is only making the situation worse, three State Department officials told reporters in a briefing Thursday.

""Libya has become the next venue for Russia's malign efforts to exploit regional conflicts for its own narrow political and economic gain,"" Deputy Assistant Secretary Christopher Robinson told reporters. ""It simultaneously engages in activities that undermine a political peace process and widen the conflict.""

Robinson and the other officials said Russia is using the Wagner Group, a private Russian militia run by an associate of President Vladimir Putin, as a ""low-cost and low-risk"" instrument to advance its goals. Photos on social media and other evidence show Wagner Group forces in Libya have ""really advanced equipment"" that illustrates the Kremlin's involvement, he said.

Russia's government has denied links to the Wagner Group. A United Nations panel of experts said 800 to 1,200 Russian mercenaries, including snipers, have been actively operating in Libya since 2018 and are effectively a ""force multiplier"" in the conflict.

While President Donald Trump at one point last year voiced support for Haftar's ""significant role in fighting terrorism,"" his administration has since backtracked.

The remarks from the State Department officials are part of an ongoing campaign by the administration to ratchet up its condemnation of Russia's role in both Libya and Syria, as well as more broadly. The officials said Russia is also trying to exploit the coronavirus pandemic to sow doubt about its origin and suggest it was spread by U.S. troops.

Russia is also working with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to transfer equipment, along with Syrian militia fighters and forces that may be coming from a third country, into Libya, Ambassador James Jeffrey, the U.S. envoy to the coalition fighting Islamic State, told reporters in the same briefing.

Buzzing through the sky in the shadow of Mount Olympus, Greek and American attack helicopters completed a live-fire exercise last week as the two NATO allies strengthened their military cooperation.

But the timing of the joint maneuvers was more testament to the geopolitics of an increasingly volatile region -- and a message to rival powers -- than a mark of any great friendship.

Greece has emerged as key to American plans to counter the influence of China and Russia in the Eastern Mediterranean as countries jostle for energy resources and infrastructure. For the Greeks, the U.S. is the only country that can contain the expansionism of Turkey, which last week sought Washington's military help as it gets mired in the war in Syria.

The U.S. ambassador to Greece, Geoffrey Pyatt, said during the exercises on Feb. 19 that the relationship was ""stronger than it has ever been"" and defense cooperation was an ""essential component of that."" A mutual accord was ratified this year in Athens weeks after Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis held talks in Washington with President Donald Trump.

A beefed up partnership with Greece is aligned with Trump's National Defense Strategy, a policy shift that aims to prevent Russia and China from expanding in countries where the U.S. has had long-term military and economic ties. Greece is also a relatively pro-American nation in Europe, where many leaders are pushing back against demands to pay more for U.S. military support.

""It's great power competition,"" Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said last week during a briefing with reporters in Washington. ""If you aren't there partnering with them and working with them, someone is going to try to fill the void.""

READ: Turkey on Verge of Military Confrontation with Russia in Syria

The U.S. and British intervened in Greece after World War II to stop the country from falling behind the Iron Curtain. By 1952, it was a member of NATO, joining alongside neighbor and traditional foe Turkey.

Greece spent the last 10 years battling an economic crisis. During that time it sold its largest port, the facilities at Piraeus adjacent to Athens, to China's state-run operator as it sought to raise money. Such investments are of particular interest to the U.S., according to McCarthy.

The Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement, which Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said was ""truly a pivotal point"" when he signed it in Athens in October, increases military cooperation by expanding infrastructure and making other improvements at the Souda base in Crete. It also allows the U.S. to use the Alexandropouli port in the north.

For the Trump administration, Greece also is one of Europe's big spenders on defense traditionally, given its location. The country already allocates more than 2% of its gross domestic product, a demand from the administration that has irked other members, like Germany. Mitsotakis also is upgrading Greece's U.S.-made F-16 fighters.

What worries Greece is that Turkey is growing more assertive in the eastern Mediterranean. While Turkey and Russia have been on opposing sides in Libya and Syria, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has formed a closer relationship with Vladimir Putin as they carve up the region.

Tension between Greece and Turkey is at the highest since the 1990s because of a dispute over maritime borders included in a recent Turkish deal with war-torn Libya and Turkish plans to explore for gas in sea areas claimed by Greece. Athens is also looking to help reduce the region's dependency on Russian gas and is working on a pipeline project linking the Aegean with Bulgaria to the north.

Cagatay Erciyes, a senior Turkish foreign ministry official, questioned last week Greek maritime claims around its islands in the Aegean and the Mediterranean. He asserted that Turkey would maintain energy exploration offshore the south of Cyprus until Turkish Cypriot rights were guaranteed.

International pressure won't ""bend Turkey's arms,"" Erciyes said. ""The U.S., our American friends, can support dialogue between Turkey and Greece.""

Indeed, the mood music around Mitsotakis and Trump is in stark contrast with Erdogan, who has often had an acrimonious relationship with his American counterpart.

The U.S. responded to Turkey's decision to buy the S-400 missile system from Russia by suspending it from the F-35 program. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper questioned in December Ankara's commitment to the NATO alliance after Erdogan threatened to close two critical installations if it's sanctioned for growing military ties to Russia.

Washington questioned the decision by Erdogan to send in troops to bolster the United Nations-backed government in Libya, a move that has upset the balance of power in the region.

""The U.S. has always had a balance of power approach, especially when an ally like Turkey is trying to assert itself unilaterally,"" said Kamran Bokhari, director of analytical development at the Center for Global Policy in Washington. ""Turkey has a lot more to offer to the U.S. than Greece, but stronger ties with the Greeks are useful as Washington doesn't want Turkey to get too comfortable in the Eastern Mediterranean region.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Athens', 'United States', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Greece', 'China', 'Washington (state)', 'Piraeus', 'Syria', 'Libya', 'United Kingdom', 'Crete', 'Germany', 'Cyprus', 'Bulgaria']","As Turkey Asks for U.S. Help, Trump Befriends Its Old Enemy",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-28/as-turkey-asks-for-u-s-help-trump-befriends-its-old-enemy,None,

The European Union agreed to deploy warships to enforce an arms embargo on Libya in a move that underscores the increasing importance the bloc places on geopolitics as it seeks to defuse the conflict ravaging a major African oil producer.

EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to launch aerial, satellite and maritime assets in the Mediterranean Sea tasked with preventing the shipment of arms to Libya's warring factions. The breakthrough came after weeks of fraught negotiations sparked by fears that immigrants seeking to cross to the EU would get intentionally shipwrecked, forcing warships to save them and bring them to European ports.

A previous naval mission, named Operation Sophia after a child born on a German frigate from a rescued Somali mother, was discontinued, as countries such as Austria and Italy argued that it acted as a ""pull factor"" for asylum seekers. According to Monday's decision, the ships from the new mission will also be withdrawn if a ""pull"" effect is observed.

Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, who had vetoed previous proposals, said he was content with the compromise. ""I believe we achieved a good fundamental consensus today,"" Schallenberg said. ""It will be a completely new mission, a new operational area, a new mandate with a clear focus on the arms embargo and clear safeguards against misuse by human traffickers.""

The goal is to end a conflict between Fayez al-Sarraj, Libya's United Nations-backed prime minister, and his rival General Khalifa Haftar. The civil war, triggered 10 months ago by Haftar's march on Tripoli, has killed more than 2,000 people and exploded into a proxy conflict drawing regional and global powers.

Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have been backing Haftar, who is also supported by Russian mercenaries, while Turkey has been sending troops and supplies to the internationally recognized government. Last week, a senior UN official called the arms embargo on Libya a ""joke"" as governments struggled to hold together efforts to end the conflict in the North African country.

Asked whether European warships would be tasked to engage with potential attempts to break the embargo by Russia or Turkey or other regional powers supporting the warring factions, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said ""they won't be there for a promenade."" The naval assets will be provided by EU member states, with Borrell telling reporters in Brussels that there's no shortage of countries volunteering to contribute.

The EU will seek to have the mission operation by the end of March, Borrell said.

The deployment will be a first test for EU's ambition to shift its focus from internal regulatory debates to geopolitics, amid an escalating global rivalry between the U.S. and China, and the increasing assertiveness of regional powers, such as Turkey and Russia.

With Germany already in a slump, the Chinese lockdown has the potential to derail Europe's first-quarter recovery. EU health ministers will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on Thursday, when the European Commission is also expected to touch upon the impact of the virus in its quarterly economic forecasts -- though it's likely to say that the situation is too uncertain to make meaningful projections at this stage.

Google Hearing | Google's decade-long antitrust fight with the EU is set for more twists and turns this week as the internet giant battles the first in a trilogy of fines that cost the company nearly $9 billion. Lawyers say the court clash -- at a three-day hearing at the EU's General Court in Luxembourg -- will help set the scene for a broader crackdown on U.S. tech giants by Margrethe Vestager.

Merkel Management | Chancellor Angela Merkel will attempt to pick up the pieces this week after her party's flirtation with the far right in eastern Germany led to a political fiasco. With the small state of Thuringia suddenly dominating national politics, Merkel and other leaders of her Christian Democratic Union, who meet today in Berlin, are trying to exclude the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, from the region's government.

Libya Conflict | United Nations-backed talks aimed at ending the conflict in Libya continue and it's becoming increasingly clear the much-advertised Berlin truce accord was little more than empty words. Meanwhile, the ""geopolitical"" EU is still struggling to equip its naval mission tasked with enforcing an arms embargo with actual warships.

Three-Way Split | Ireland saw a seismic election over the weekend. While the final outcome remains uncertain, it's clear Sinn Fein, long considered toxic for its IRA links and left-wing policies, has moved to the center of the political landscape, becoming a key power broker in the process.

Salvini's Fate | The Italian Senate will vote Wednesday on whether right-wing leader Matteo Salvini should face prosecution for kidnapping by refusing to allow a coastguard ship that had rescued 131 migrants to dock in Sicily in July. Salvini says that he defended Italy, was applying government policy and was waiting for other EU countries to accept the migrants.

Chinese Warning | China warned France against treating Huawei differently from European competitors when it comes to future 5G network equipment contracts, as the U.S. presses ahead with a campaign to keep the tech giant at bay. As France prepares to auction 5G spectrum in April, its main carrier, Orange, has already announced it would leave Huawei out and work instead with Nokia and Ericsson.

Ousted Envoy | Gordon Sondland announced he'd been ousted as U.S. ambassador to the EU, as President Donald Trump moved swiftly to exact retribution on those he blames for his impeachment. We suspect he won't be missed by EU officials and diplomats in Brussels.

Educating Finns | In Finland, which just topped the UN's World Happiness Index, the central bank is drawing up a financial-literacy strategy for citizens. They won't stay the most cheerful people on earth for much longer if they keep borrowing so much, so some help with managing their finances was deemed necessary.

Protests Uncorked | Sommeliers, wine importers and restaurateurs took to the streets of Washington on Sunday with a message for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer: ""Keep your tariffs off our Beaujolais."" The march was a last-ditch effort to stave off the threat of tariffs as high as 100% on a range of European products including wine, cheese and olive oil that could be announced as soon as this month.

Germany's industrial woes showed no sign of abating at the end of 2019, and a slump in December raises the prospect the economy could have contracted in the fourth quarter. Bloomberg Economics estimates gross domestic product shrank in the three months through December, as do analysts at Societe Generale and ABN Amro.

11400779,2020-08-29,"Libya's presidential council suspended its interior minister for allegedly encouraging anti-corruption protests, a move that threatens to escalate a power struggle in the months after a devastating war.

The internationally-recognized government said in a statement late Friday that Fathi Bashagha had been removed pending an investigation. Bashagha responded by saying he will co-operate, as long as the hearing is held in public.

Tripoli, the Libyan capital, recently emerged from a 14-month siege by the forces of eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, who's backed by Russia, Egypt and the U.A.E, before a Turkish intervention helped repel his troops. The North African country is now divided between the rival camps, with its economy in tatters and protests taking place over deteriorating services and graft.

What Lies Behind the Nine Years of Turmoil in Libya: QuickTake

Bashagha, who is seen by Western diplomats as a capable partner in tackling lawless militias that have infiltrated state institutions, had pledged to defend the protesters after members of the Nawasi group cracked down on a demonstration last week, wounding several and detaining dozens.

Tackling the powerful but unpopular militias and corruption had been a key demand of Haftar and his backers, but also of Western countries such as the U.S. that had been working with Bashagha on security reforms. He had particularly targeted the Nawasi, which is meant to be under his ministry's control but acts independently.

The decision by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj to suspend Bashagha was met with celebrations overnight by militia members, and some protests in Bashagha's home city of Misrata.

""It's the return of the spat between the Nawasis and Bashagha from a few months ago -- we knew it would circle back after the war,"" said Tarek Megerisi, a Libya expert and policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""There's also a political layer. Sarraj hears whispers going around from the international community that they wish they had Bashagha to deal with.""

The U.S. embassy said it appreciates its partnerships with Sarraj and Bashagha and urged cooperation.

Two officials close to Sarraj, who has accused the protesters of lawlessness, said Bashagha had gone beyond his mandate as a minister. One of them said Bashagha alienated the militias rather than patiently trying to absorb them, an approach he said could have led to battles in Tripoli.

Bashagha's supporters say the militias had become too entrenched and were acting as a parallel state.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Misrata']",Libya Security Chief Suspended in Escalating Power Struggle,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-29/libya-security-chief-suspended-in-escalating-power-struggle,None,

Turkey said it wouldn't curtail its offshore explorations as a precondition to restart negotiations with Greece, throwing into question a German-led effort to defuse tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.

""It's impossible for us to accept all the conditions set by Greece for a good dialog,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday in a joint press conference with his German counterpart Heiko Maas. ""We are ready to enter talks without preconditions, but if one party starts imposing conditions, we have many of those to list ourselves.""

Maas traveled to Athens and Ankara on Tuesday in an effort to put an end to the escalating conflict over the NATO allies' competing maritime claims. Talks collapsed earlier this month after Athens announced a maritime delimitation agreement with Egypt on Aug. 6, similar to a Turkey-Libya deal in December.

The disputed region in the Mediterranean Sea has become an energy hot spot with big natural gas finds for Cyprus, Israel and Egypt in recent years. Turkey's push to secure a share of the resources has deepened strains between the historic rivals.

""The current situation in the eastern Mediterranean is playing with fire, with any small spark potentially leading to catastrophe,"" Maas told reporters in Athens earlier in the day. ""What we need immediately are signals of de-escalation and a readiness for dialog.""

Greece on Monday began joint military exercises with the U.S. in an area that partially overlapped with the expected location of a Turkish survey ship, which Ankara had announced would explore that area until Aug. 27, three days longer than had been originally planned.

""Greece has shown that it's ready for dialog, but not amid challenges and as its sovereign rights are being violated,"" Greek Foreign Minister Nikolaos Dendias said, adding that he expects a possible list of sanctions against Turkey to be presented at an EU meeting later this week.

EU foreign ministers will meet in Berlin this week to discuss ""our relationship with Turkey, and Greece's voice will have special weight,"" Maas said.

Greece says that islands must be taken into account in delineating a country's continental shelf, in line with the United Nations Law of the Sea, which Turkey has not signed.

Ankara argues it should be measured from the mainland, and that the area south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo -- just a few kilometers off Turkey's southern coast -- therefore falls within its exclusive zone.

Turkey is also at loggerheads with Cyprus over offshore gas reserves around the island, where the Republic of Cyprus is an EU member state and officially has sovereignty over the entire island.

But the island has been effectively divided into two since Turkey's military captured the northern third in 1974, following a coup attempt in which a military junta in Athens sought to unite Cyprus with Greece.

Greek Cypriots who dominated the area before its 1974 takeover by the Turks will be among those able to reclaim lost property as the plan -- branded as an economic stimulus program -- gets underway.

""There should be dialog between the two communities on the island on all issues: Varosha, property issues and energy resources around the island,"" a spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Ibrahim Kalin, said in an interview on Saturday.

""If the Greek Cypriots want to come, claim their property, pay for it, run businesses, etc., it will be possible,"" once legal issues are resolved, Kalin said.

Turkey and Cyprus are at loggerheads over offshore gas reserves around the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where the Republic of Cyprus is an EU member state and officially has sovereignty over the entire island.

But the island has been effectively divided into two since Turkey's military captured the northern third in 1974, following a coup attempt in which a military junta in Athens sought to unite Cyprus with Greece. The Turkish minority's self-proclaimed state in the north, recognized only by Ankara, also claims rights to any energy resources discovered off its coast.

Varosha, near the port of Famagusta, had been the island's premier tourist resort before it was abandoned and sealed off following the Turkish takeover of northern Cyprus. Investment in trade and tourism in the town would imply recognition of Turkey's control, and the plan to reopen it threatens to deepen growing strains with Cyprus and its ally Greece over natural gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean.

In the immediate term, at least, Turkish Cypriots are likeliest to benefit from any economic activity in the town, where ruined beachfront apartment buildings, villas, a fur shop and an Alfa Romeo dealer are partly overrun by tangles of ivy.

How Tensions Are Rising Over Mediterranean Gas Fields: QuickTake

Ersin Tatar, the prime minister of the breakaway Turkish enclave, told CNN-Turk that more than 200 applications to reclaim properties in Varosha have been submitted and are being reviewed. Turkey kept Varosha closed and uninhabited after its Greek-speaking residents abandoned during the 1974 intervention.

Tensions in the region flared in August after Turkey resumed exploration and launched naval exercises in an area of the eastern Mediterranean where its claims are contested by Cyprus. Ankara on Monday extended seismic work by its research vessel, the Oruc Reis, through Aug. 27 in the contested waters.

German-mediated negotiations with Greece collapsed after the Athens government announced a maritime delimitation agreement with Egypt on Aug. 6, similar to a Turkey-Libya deal in December. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas is expected to arrive in Turkey on Tuesday in a new mediation attempt.

11400784,2020-06-09,"Former CEO died from pneumonia after long battle with illness

Ian Taylor, the trader who helped shape the modern oil market by transforming a small Dutch fuel merchant called Vitol Group into one of the world's biggest commodity houses, has died.

""It is with great sadness that Vitol today announces the death of its Chairman and former CEO, Ian Taylor, from pneumonia, following a long battle with illness,"" the company said in a statement. He was 64.

An Oxford-educated Briton with Scottish family roots, Taylor joined Vitol from Royal Dutch Shell Plc in 1985 and took over as chief executive officer a decade later. Despite the occasional brush with scandal, Vitol grew at a rate few in Silicon Valley could match under his watch, increasing net income from $22.9 million in 1995 to a record $2.28 billion in 2009.

Mixing an easy charm with a relentless business mind, Taylor struck lucrative deals with governments, national oil companies, refiners and producers to transform Vitol into a global player. Today, operations range from trading floors in London, Singapore and Houston, through storage tanks in the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates, to filling stations in Australia.

""You need to have relationships,"" Taylor told Bloomberg News in 2016.

Vitol plays a crucial role in energy markets, buying, selling, blending and transporting crude oil and fuel around the world. In more than half a century, the company has never suffered an annual loss. It earned $1.5 billion in 2017, the last full-year Taylor served as CEO. Battling cancer, he moved to the role of chairman in 2018, when one of his longtime lieutenants Russell Hardy took over.

""Ian was an exceptional man. He combined energy and a determination to succeed with humility, humor and humanity,"" Hardy said in the statement. ""He challenged all of us to be the best we could be. We owe him a great deal.""

Success brought rewards for Taylor and Vitol's other employees, who are also the firm's shareholders. Over the last decade during his tenure as CEO its 350 top employees received a total of more than $10 billion in payouts, according to corporate fillings.

Along with Glencore Plc's CEO Ivan Glasenberg and Trafigura's late co-founder and former chairman and CEO Claude Dauphin, Taylor is widely regarded as a pioneer of global commodities trading. He started at Shell in 1978, where he learned oil trading through stints in Singapore and Caracas.

""Ian was one of the last of the pioneers that helped transform the oil trading industry. He will be missed."" Glasenberg, said.

Taylor refused to follow Glencore's path and become a public company, keeping the firm private despite numerous conversations over the years about an initial public offering, or selling the business to others -- at one point a buyout by now-defunct trader Enron was discussed.

Amid Vitol's soaring growth and profits, Taylor remained at the front line of the firm's day to day operations. In the midst of Libya's civil war, Taylor and another top executive, Chris Bake, flew into Benghazi in 2011 to personally negotiate a deal to supply fuel to rebels fighting against the 42-year dictatorship of Colonel Moammar Qaddafi. Vitol would be paid in crude oil.

The agreed Libya deal went awry within days as Qaddafi's forces blew up a key pipeline. Still, Vitol and Taylor kept up their end of the bargain and were eventually repaid in full.

""It was a deal which, to be honest, got much larger than it should have,"" Taylor said.

In Depth: Hidden Oil Giant Vitol Skirts War, Market Chaos to Make Billions

The head of Trafigura Group, Jeremy Weir, said Taylor was a formidable figure in the modern commodities trading industry, and central to the establishment of Vitol as a success.

""He was also widely liked and admired as a human being, and will be sorely missed by those who knew him and worked alongside him,"" Weir said.

As CEO, Taylor suffered the most damaging hit to his reputation in 2007 after allegations Vitol paid about $13 million in ""surcharges"" to the regime of Saddam Hussein to secure oil shipments. An investigation led by Paul Volcker, the former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, exposed a world of illicit payments, secret bank accounts, and diplomats for hire. Vitol pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of the State of New York.

""We did a settlement to protect our own staff,"" Taylor said, suggesting that without the deal, U.S. prosecutors could have charged individual traders.

Beyond his role in global commodities trading, Taylor is credited with saving and rejuvenating the industry that produces the fabric tweed on the remote Scottish island of Harris. He was well known in the U.K. as a philanthropist to the arts -- opera and ballet were a particular passion -- and had been a major donor to the ruling Conservative party. As a pro-European, he was firmly on the remain side of the Brexit debate.

""He was an iconic figure and a man not afraid to go where others wouldn't, following a long British tradition,"" said Jorge Montepeque, a veteran oil market executive.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Netherlands', 'Singapore', 'Houston', 'London', 'Scotland', 'Libya', 'United Kingdom', 'Australia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Caracas', 'Benghazi', 'United States']","Ian Taylor, Trader Who Built Oil Powerhouse Vitol, Dies at 64",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/oil-trader-vitol-says-former-ceo-ian-taylor-has-died,None,
11400785,2020-02-15,"History-rich North Africa nation has long been tricky to visit

A short flight from Europe, there's a country that just about offers it all but where you'll struggle to spot a foreign tourist. Perhaps not for much longer.

With a warm Mediterranean sea in summer, great winter skiing, vast Saharan deserts, towering Roman ruins and prehistoric art of global renown alongside an intriguing modern Arab culture, Algeria should be a top travel destination.

But as neighbors built hotels and marketed their charms, it was deep in a brutal 1990s civil war with Islamist militants, a conflict that left the country deeply scarred and ruled over by a cabal of army officers and independence-era politicians who looked inward and relied on oil to bankroll the state.

At last that self-imposed seclusion could be about to end, with officials embarking on the first serious effort to relax visa restrictions that mean the North African nation and OPEC member remains among the region's trickiest places to visit.

Algeria's ready to become ""the alternative destination for the Mediterranean,"" said Abdelkader Gouti, an adviser to the Tourism Ministry. ""It's a real industry that generates a lot of wealth in terms of currency and jobs. Algeria cannot afford the luxury of remaining on the sidelines.""

In going after vacationers, the government is following the lead taken last year by Saudi Arabia, which issued its first tourist visas as part of an economic overhaul to help wean it off its hydrocarbon addiction.

Algeria pumped its financial riches into an elaborate subsidy system to keep the peace, but after oil prices slumped in 2014 that became harder to sustain. Overwhelmingly peaceful youth protests erupted a year ago, eventually toppling veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and convincing his successors that something had to change. Many of Algeria's 44 million people still regularly take to the streets.

Algeria has recorded between 2.5 million and 3.5 million annual tourist visits in recent years, although the vast majority were by Algerians living abroad, Gouti said in an interview. By contrast, more than 13 million people visited Morocco last year.

Closing the gap won't be easy. Morocco has been luring international travelers since the 1920s with its oases, mountains and buzzing cities, while the beach resorts and markets of Tunisia -- the region's only full democracy -- are again popular with Europeans after jihadist attacks in 2015 battered the industry.

Providing at least some of the services that foreign tourists expect will be a challenge for Algeria's besieged leadership.

""Improving the visa regime represents a positive step,"" said Anthony Skinner at Verisk Maplecroft, a U.K.-based risk consultancy. But ""authorities will also have to engage in a robust PR campaign to challenge rival, long-established Mediterranean destinations.""

Gouti said ""cheap mass tourism"" isn't the answer, and Algeria will target wealthier visitors and adventure holidays. All the same, he cited plans to expand the port in the capital, Algiers, for hosting cruise-ships, and develop at least one resort on its lengthy Mediterranean coastline. The goal is 5 million annual tourists by 2025, half the capacity of a much-touted new terminal at Algiers' airport that opened last year.

Perched over a deep ravine, the so-called 'City of Bridges' is one of Algeria's iconic sights, with a selection of Ottoman-era homes and mosques.

Overlooking the Mediterranean, the country's two largest cities are places of grand boulevards and maze-like old quarters that rival anything in neighboring Morocco.

Some of North Africa's best-preserved Roman ruins lie in the mountains just outside Algiers. Both date from the 1st century AD, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites and sport the remains of theaters, temples and homes

This southeastern national park has some of the world's most important prehistoric art. The 15,000-plus engravings found on this plateau bordering Libya, Nigeria and Mali include depictions of crocodiles, antelopes and hunters, some dating from 6,000 BC.

Algeria's most popular ski resort sits among cedar forests in the Atlas Mountains, about 40 miles south of the capital. Developed by French colonialists in the 1940s, it was restored after the 1990s civil war.

Investors from Turkey and Gulf countries including Qatar are interested ""because everything remains to be done in Algeria,"" according to Gouti. In Morocco and Tunisia, tourism ""is saturated,"" while Algeria's recent lifting of a restriction on foreigners owning the majority of a business has helped drum up attention.

Granting foreigners quick access would be a dramatic turnaround for Algeria, which has been under tight government control ever since independence from France in the 1960s. Securing a visa for most travelers takes at least two weeks, sometimes much longer, and needs extensive documentation. Citizens of neighbors including Morocco, Tunisia and Libya can visit for 90 days visa-free, as can Malaysians.

President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who was elected in December in a vote many boycotted, is expected to soon sign into law a new government action plan whose economic pledges include supporting travel agencies, encouraging more charter flights and facilitating visa procedures for foreign tourists. The draft gives few details on how they'll be implemented.

A new visa system will be ready ""in the coming weeks,"" Gouti said, declining to be more specific.

Europeans ""who are right next door with air links"" are the main prize, although Algeria also wants to attract visitors from China, Canada and the U.S, he said. Under the plans, tourism's share of gross domestic product will triple to 4.5% in 2025.

Algeria has seen postwar Islamist violence, including a 2013 attack on a gas plant partly run by BP Plc near the Libyan border that killed at least 38 foreign hostages. But it hasn't been ravaged by the kind of sustained conflict seen elsewhere in the Middle East.

The U.S., and other Western nations, warn against visiting some parts of Algeria, including traveling overland in the Sahara. Gouti, though, said any trips would be trouble-free.

11400860,2020-11-22,"French investigators wiretapped ex-president's secret phone

Nicolas Sarkozy's corruption trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Paris over allegations he promised to help an official land a prestigious Monaco court job in exchange for covert aid in a legal fight to stop investigators using the former French president's diaries.

The much-awaited trial includes evidence prosecutors obtained by wiretapping Sarkozy's calls on so-called burner phones with his then-lawyer, who acted as a go-between, according to the indictment. It centers on how Sarkozy may have abused his power by coaxing the senior legal official, known as an avocat général, to use his own connections with judicial colleagues to influence the outcome of the diaries case.

When Sarkozy's lawyer told him -- in a tapped call -- in 2014 that the official was hoping for a good word to get an appointment at Monaco's top administrative court, the ex-president replied: ""I'll help him.""

Sarkozy is only the second former French president to go on trial in modern times, and the first over corruption accusations. After leaving office in 2007, the late Jacques Chirac was prosecuted over allegations dating back to his years as mayor of Paris. He received a suspended jail sentence after being found guilty of misusing city funds to benefit his supporters and political party.

The trial, which also includes Sarkozy's then-lawyer, Thierry Herzog, is set to run until Dec. 10. It could be postponed after the now-retired civil servant, Gilbert Azibert, requested a delay due to health problems. All three defendants risk a maximum jail sentence of 10 years as well as a fine.

Ever since losing his bid for re-election after serving as president from 2007 to 2012, Sarkozy has been mired in legal woes. Just weeks after his presidential immunity ended, his private home and his Paris office were raided by police in a probe into claims that he received illegal campaign cash from L'Oreal SA heiress Liliane Bettencourt ahead of his 2007 election.

Even though these accusations against Sarkozy were dropped in 2013, the ex-president fought on to make sure details of his presidential diaries, which had been seized by investigators at his Paris office, were struck out from the file as the Bettencourt case progressed without him.

He lodged a first lawsuit, which was dismissed, and then appealed at France's top court, the Cour de Cassation. It was the outcome of that second lawsuit that he was allegedly trying to illegally monitor and influence with the help of Azibert. While the Bettencourt case file was confidential, Sarkozy was fighting as a matter of principle: he considered the immunity he'd benefited from as France's president prevented the use of his diaries by investigators.

Lawyers for Sarkozy, Herzog and Azibert declined to comment ahead of the trial. Sarkozy and Herzog's defense teams have claimed during the investigation that Azibert never provided any confidential information and never tried to influence top court officials involved in the lawsuit. They say there was never any sort of quid pro quo.

In 2013, French investigators had begun tapping Sarkozy's regular phone as part of a different probe into allegations of illegal funding of the Frenchman's 2007 campaign by the regime of Libya's former leader Muammar Qaddafi.

But Sarkozy and Herzog had been using various burner phones starting in 2012 as they suspected their conversations on official lines might have been recorded, investigators say in the indictment. It wasn't until two years later that authorities uncovered the pair's secret numbers.

In the February 2014 conversation, Herzog told Sarkozy that a vacancy was expected to come up shortly at the Monaco court but that Azibert thought he might ""need a bit of help"" to get the job. Sarkozy told his lawyer that he should ""call him today and tell him I'll take care of it because I'm going to Monaco."" Sarkozy later phoned to say he'd arranged a meeting with a Monaco minister to raise the matter.

But in a subsequent conversation Sarkozy said he'd had second thoughts about interceding in favor of someone he didn't know well. Investigators believe that change-of-heart conversation was staged. They were never able to find evidence to back their suspicions that someone had tipped off the former president that his burner phone was being tapped.

Azibert never got the Monaco job and Sarkozy lost his Cour de Cassation lawsuit to strike his presidential agendas from the Bettencourt case file.

Under French law, simply offering to carry out a favor for an official is illegal, regardless of whether the promise was made good, according to the indictment.

Sarkozy's legal problems won't be over after his corruption trial. He is due back in court next year on charges that he illegally exceeded campaign-spending limits on his failed 2012 re-election bid and the investigation into alleged covert Libyan funding is ongoing.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Paris', 'Monaco', 'France', 'Libya']","Sarkozy's Burner Phone, a Job in Monaco and a Corruption Trial",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-22/sarkozy-s-burner-phone-a-job-in-monaco-and-a-corruption-trial,None,
11401000,2020-10-15,"Figures from OPEC, IEA, EIA indicate that an easing of oil production curbs in January looks increasingly challenging.

Every time the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries assesses the short-term outlook for the oil market, it gets just a little bit bleaker. The group's own numbers are piling pressure on its members and their allies in the so-called OPEC+ coalition to delay or water down output cuts originally planned for January.

The world now needs anywhere between about 600,000 and 2.2 million barrels a day less crude from OPEC countries through the end of 2021 to balance supply and demand than was thought necessary three months ago, according to the latest monthly reports from OPEC, the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Of the three, OPEC is the most pessimistic.

The chart below shows how the three agencies' forecasts for the amount of OPEC crude needed to balance global oil supply and demand have evolved since July, when OPEC extended its short-term outlook into next year.

Since that initial 2021 forecast in July, OPEC has cut its expectation of the world's need for its members' crude each month, and for almost every quarter. The only exception is a jump in the April-to-June period, after the group increased its assessment of global oil demand in that quarter by 860,000 barrels a day from last month's report, having cut it by 700,000 barrels a day between the August and September reports.

OPEC sees demand for its crude ranging from 27 million to 29 million barrels a day next year. After making the biggest output cuts in their history back in May, the OPEC countries aren't pumping anything like that much. Their aim is to ensure that excess stockpiles that were amassed during the depth of the pandemic are drawn back down. They are supposed to meet in late November and December with a view to ratifying a pact to add barrels to the market from January.

The latest outlooks add weight to the argument that the OPEC+ coalition will need to delay or water down any such easing of its output cuts. A deteriorating demand outlook -- OPEC has cut its 2021 forecast by 880,000 barrels a day since July -- has combined with expectations of more supply from non-OPEC rivals: the group's assessment of non-OPEC supply next year has risen by 1 million barrels a day since July.

That increase is driven by an expectation of higher U.S. oil production, which OPEC now sees averaging 18.06 million barrels a day next year, including condensates and natural gas liquids, compared with 17.27 million barrels forecast in July. In contrast, the EIA has raised its forecast of U.S. production by a much more modest 240,000 barrels a day over the same period.

In practice, OPEC+ output restrictions mean that the dwindling call on OPEC crude will delay the return of oil stockpiles to more normal levels. Assuming that the OPEC countries stick to the output deal agreed in April, and that Libya's production recovers to average 500,000 barrels a day next year, global oil stockpiles at the end of 2021 will still be 420 million barrels above where they were at the end of 2019.

11401001,2020-03-02,"Cartel is mulling deeper reduction in response to coronavirus

OPEC's output plunged again last month as the group's voluntary cutbacks were amplified by a conflict that halted exports from Libya.

Production declined by 480,000 barrels a day to 27.91 million a day in February, according to a Bloomberg survey. That's the lowest since 2009, when the group had just slashed supplies during the global financial crisis, yet OPEC finds itself under pressure to reduce output even further in response to the coronavirus.

The outbreak that started in China and is spreading around the world could be the biggest commodity-demand shock since the great recession of 2008 to 2009, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The coronavirus is battering world fuel consumption as industries shut down, entire cities are quarantined and air travel slumps, sending crude prices plunging.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners were already struggling to manage the price impact from the U.S. shale boom. They launched a new round of supply curbs at the start of this year, and the survey showed a mixed rate of implementation among the cartel's members.

The poll is based on information from officials, ship-tracking data and estimates from consultants including Rystad Energy AS, JBC Energy GmbH and Rapidan Energy Group. The comparison between output in February and historical data is affected by membership changes, with Ecuador, Qatar and Indonesia having left the group while Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea joined.

Though Saudi Arabia -- OPEC's biggest member -- delivered its pledges in full, Iraq and Nigeria, which have repeatedly demonstrated poor implementation, actually increased their production.

Those increases however were eclipsed by a plunge in Libya, where a rebel military commander has blockaded oil ports while haggling over a peace settlement with the national government. Libya's output tumbled by 640,000 barrels a day, or about 80%, to just 150,000 barrels a day. The country has long been exempt from making cuts as part of the OPEC+ deal because of its internal struggles.

The North African producer has lost almost 1 million barrels a day since the start of the year because of the conflict -- roughly equivalent to all of the voluntary curbs that OPEC and its allies promised as part of their latest intervention. Libya's misfortune is sparing other OPEC members from an even deeper rout in crude prices.

OPEC is expected to cut deeper at this week's meeting. All but two of 29 analysts, traders and brokers surveyed by Bloomberg predict that the OPEC+ coalition will announce substantial additional reductions when it meets on March 5 to 6, with an average estimate of 750,000 barrels a day. The alliance spans all 13 OPEC nations, plus 10 non-members such as Russia, and accounts for about half the world's oil supplies.

Saudi Arabia has been pressing OPEC+ to act for several weeks. Though there has been reluctance from Russia -- their most important partner -- there are signs that Moscow now recognizes the need for some kind of response.

The situation in global markets is certainly serious, with prices near their lowest in more than two years and a growing contingent of trading desks anticipating that demand growth could be wiped out for the first time in more than a decade.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Libya', 'United States', 'Qatar', 'Indonesia', 'Ecuador', 'China', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Nigeria', 'Iraq', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Gabon', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Moscow']",OPEC Production Sinks Before Meeting as Conflict Roils Libya,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-02/opec-production-sinks-before-meeting-as-conflict-roils-libya,None,

But the three big forecasting agencies are far apart on how severe that impact will be and what it means for 2020 oil balances.

The International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Administration and OPEC -- the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- have all slashed their forecasts for global oil demand in the first two quarters of 2020 in their monthly reports published this week. The severity of the reductions they made may reflect the points of view of the three agencies in the absence of hard evidence of an actual impact on demand.

It is no surprise that the IEA, representing the major oil consuming nations, sees the biggest impact on demand. Nor that OPEC -- representative of the oil producers who are desperately trying to prop up prices through their words, if not yet their actions -- sees the smallest effect. The EIA -- representative of the country that is now both the world's biggest oil consumer and also its largest producer -- finds itself in the middle.

First-quarter global oil demand will now be 1.3 million barrels a day lower than thought a month ago, according to the IEA. That cut is three times as big as the impact seen by OPEC, and is deep enough to tip the world into its first year-on-year drop in demand in a decade, the IEA says. China's oil consumption this quarter is now forecast to be 940,000 barrels a day lower than the agency predicted a month ago and below the levels for the corresponding quarter both last year and in 2018. Year-on-year demand growth should return in the second quarter, the IEA says, but it will remain muted at 270,000 barrels a day, little more than half the increase seen a month ago.

OPEC appears not nearly so worried. The Covid-19 virus will reduce China's first-quarter oil demand by just 160,000 barrels a day from last month's estimate and consumption will still be up by 140,000 barrels a day over the same period in 2019, a comparison of the group's January and February reports shows. That view may be difficult to square with some of the data being monitored by BloombergNEF. China's jet fuel use is now down by 240,000 barrels a day from pre-virus levels and roads remain empty despite the end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday.

Beyond the virus, some interesting patterns have emerged for global oil demand forecasts. Estimates for last year's consumption and year-on-year growth are also being revised down. Again, the IEA and EIA are taking more bearish positions than OPEC.

Following the pattern set for all previous quarters of 2019, estimates of oil demand and year-on-year growth in the final quarter are now being cut as hard data become available.

The IEA reduced its estimate of 2019 global oil demand by 110,000 barrels a day in this month's report from where it pegged it in January. The biggest quarterly revision, of 230,000 barrels a day, was for the final three months of the year. Oil demand growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 is now seen at 1.72 million barrels a day -- a figure that could fall further if the pattern set by previous periods is maintained.

The EIA has followed a similar path, cutting demand and growth estimates for every quarter of last year, with the reductions for the fourth quarter almost twice as big as those for any of the three earlier periods. Only OPEC saw things differently, reserving its downward revisions for the first and third quarters and leaving its assessments for the second and fourth unchanged. It is more optimistic about last year's demand growth than either of the other two forecasters, although it too is seeing that growth dwindling and now pegs it at 920,000 barrels a day.

OPEC's more positive view on oil demand leaves it as the only one of the big three international agencies expecting global stockpiles to be whittled down this year, assuming OPEC output remains unchanged from its January level of 28.86 million barrels a day reported by the group's secondary sources.

Almost all of Libya's shipments of more than 1.1 million barrels a day were shut in around the middle of last month when forces loyal to warlord Khalifa Haftar forced the closure of the country's oil export terminals, reducing its production by nearly 350,000 barrels a day as storage tanks were filled. If ports are not re-opened, most of the remaining 800,000 barrels a day of production will disappear this month, cutting the OPEC total (which still includes Ecuador in all three agencies' reports) to little more than 28 million barrels a day -- the lowest in more than a decade for the current members.

Even without the further drop in Libya's production, OPEC sees global oil inventories being drawn down at an average rate of 440,000 barrels a day this year. That's in stark contrast to the IEA and EIA, who both see them being built up by a similar amount.

However, it's really the three agencies' very different analyses of demand Covid-19's demand hit that will determine if inventories are going to rise or fall later this year.

11401025,2020-08-19,"Normalization of relations is key to the Emirati view of regional security and its own economic future.

The agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to normalize relations didn't come out of the clear blue sky: since the mid-1990s, many Gulf Arab countries have been slowly and quietly building their relationships with Israel, without breaking the long-standing taboo against formal recognition without any significant progress on Palestinian rights. The UAE's decision to take the plunge reflects a willingness to cross that line in pursuit of the ambitious role it has set for itself in the Middle East.

Despite its small size, the UAE aspires to be one of the region's leaders, promoting an Emirati vision for the social, political and economic future in the Arab world. This view emphasizes religious tolerance, ethnic diversity, social and cultural openness, and confident Arab cultural and economic engagement with the outside world. But it has little use for democracy, instead championing a strict security state that closely regulates political speech and activity.

Above all, the Emirati doctrine rejects the injection of religion into politics, and vice-versa. This puts the UAE on a collision course not only with Shiite-Islamist Iran, but also with Turkey and its Sunni-Islamist alliance, including Qatar, Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Tripoli-based government of Libya.

The UAE viewed the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings as an open doorway to Islamist rule in Arab republics and strongly supported the 2013 ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt by the military under General Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. The Emiratis were never involved in the Syrian war because opposition groups were too Islamist for their liking. In Libya, Tunisia, Sudan and the horn of Africa, the UAE has sought to extend its influence and curtail that of Islamists.

A partnership with Israel fits into the Emirati doctrine. For Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and main author of the doctrine, Iran represents the greatest danger to the region, a view he shares with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Not only are the glittering cities of the UAE sitting ducks for Iranian missiles, the Islamic Republic's ability (and frequent threats) to choke off the Straits of Hormuz threatens the economies of all the Gulf Arab states.

Historically, the Emiratis relied on the U.S. for protection. But the UAE is no longer confident of Washington's willingness to help. President Barack Obama's eagerness to make a nuclear deal with Iran dismayed MBZ, as the prince is known. And although he has cultivated a good relationship with the Trump administration, he knows not to trust the current occupant of the White House.

So, the UAE has taken the lead among Gulf Arab countries in actively diversifying its security relationships, including a strategic partnership with Russia that includes stronger economic ties and a quiet alliance, along with Egypt, in tactical battlefields such as Libya. But the understanding with Russia is of limited use against the Iranian threat: Tehran is building an ever-closer relationship to Moscow. On the other hand, the Islamic Republic is implacably hostile to Israel, which is attacking its proxies in Syria and Lebanon.

The U.S. may be leading the anti-Iranian coalition, but from the Emirati point of view, it is Israel that's doing most of the kinetic heavy lifting. So, normalization with Israel is crucial to the UAE's security calculations, for itself and its neighborhood. The clandestine Israeli-Emirati security relationship can now be strengthened in the open. Israeli defense manufacturers expect orders worth billions of dollars from the UAE in the coming months.

American manufacturers, too: The Emiratis will hope to get some exemptions from U.S. defense-export restrictions that ensure Israel has what is known as a ""qualitative military edge"" over Arab states. More generally, normalization of relations with Israel has already greatly improved the UAE's standing in Washington, not only with the Trump administration but also with Democratic leaders.

The agreement with Israel will also strengthen the UAE against the Turkish threat, real and perceived, to its interests. This will likely play out in Libya, where the Emiratis are backing the rebel commander Khalifa Haftar against the Tripoli government. There have already been unconfirmed reports of Israeli-made military equipment finding its way into rebel hands. More will undoubtedly follow.

Finally, a deeper relationship with Israel will serve the UAE's vision of its economic future as a regional hub for science and technology. It has already acted on this ambition, becoming the first Arab country with a major nuclear power program and it recently launched the region's first interplanetary venture, a mission to Mars. Emirati firms can now openly pursue partnerships with Israeli tech companies.

Ankara resumed its search of the contested waters last week after German-mediated negotiations with Greece collapsed when Athens announced a maritime delimitation agreement with Egypt on Aug. 6 in retaliation to a similar deal between Turkey and Libya.

Turkey Wrangles With France Over East Mediterranean Energy Rift

The eastern Mediterranean has become an energy hot spot with big finds for EU member Cyprus, as well as Israel and Egypt in recent years. Turkey is now pushing to secure a share of the resources, defying warnings from the bloc that its unilateral actions could further strain ties.

France has temporarily beefed up its military presence in the region to ward against Turkey's steps. Turkey on Monday accused France, Armenia and the United Arab Emirates of forming an alliance against Turkey. The UAE and Egypt are allies, while Armenia is a landlocked country and a historical rival of Turkey.

This ""unravels the dimensions of an insidious alliance that is being attempted to be forged against Turkey,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""No matter what, Turkey will resolutely continue to protect both her and Turkish Cypriots' rights in the Eastern Mediterranean stemming from international law. No alliance of malice will manage to prevent this.""

After dispatching the Oruc Reis survey ship to the south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo last week, Turkey added the 230-meter (755-foot) long Yavuz drilling vessel on Tuesday. It's accompanied by three offshore supply ships under the protection of the Turkish navy. ""All vessels are strongly advised not to enter this area,"" a Turkish navy website said Saturday as it designated exploration areas off-limits through Sept. 15.

Turkey -- which sent troops and captured the northern third of Cyprus in the wake of a 1974 coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece -- doesn't recognize Cyprus as a sovereign country and opposes Cypriot drilling without an agreement on sharing any proceeds with the Turkish Cypriots.

The internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus has licensed several offshore exploration blocks, some of them located in disputed waters. Cyprus has an agreement with Exxon Mobil, Total SA and Eni SpA for oil and natural gas exploration rights near an area where Turkey wants to drill.

Here's What Is at Stake as Turkey-Greece Tensions Rise Again

Ankara also doesn't recognize Greece's claim that its territorial waters start immediately south of the island of Kastellorizo, the most distant Greek outpost in the contested area. It argues that a country's continental shelf should be measured from its mainland. Greece says that islands must also be taken into account in delineating a country's continental shelf, in line with the UN Law of the Sea.

""The escalation of the Turkish provocation is directed against Europe and the response must be escalated accordingly,"" Greek Foreign Minister Nikolaos Dendias said after meeting with his Cypriot counterpart Nicos Christodoulides in Nicosia.

The Israeli-Emirati commitment to normalize relations, brokered by the U.S., obviously stands to benefit all three parties. But what will the agreement mean for Middle Eastern countries whose signatures won't be on it?

The Palestinians, apparently taken by surprise, have denounced the move as ""treason,"" and demanded that it be rescinded. For them, it is disastrous that the United Arab Emirates has broken a long-standing consensus that all relations with Israel must be based on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which offered Israel normalization with the entire Arab world after an agreement to create a Palestinian state.

The UAE has violated this Arab red line by joining Egypt, Jordan and Mauritania in committing to normalize relations with Israel, but without any progress on ending the occupation. (Egypt and Jordan made peace treaties well before 2002, in exchange for territories lost in war; Mauritania, a marginal Arab state, normalized relations in 1999, only to freeze them again in 2009.) The Emiratis say they acted to prevent imminent annexation and preserve the possibility of a Palestinian state, and therefore also the viability of the API. But few other Arabs and almost no Palestinians will see it that way.

Avoiding annexation is obviously a very good thing from a Palestinian point of view. But the cost at the breaking of the API consensus, often cited as the basis of Palestinian policy as well, and a two-state future will be viewed as unaffordable.

Saudi Arabia is also likely to be miffed, in part at least because the API was a Saudi initiative. Yet Riyadh has also clearly been interested in strengthening relations with Israel as a counter to Iran, and will pay close attention to how the UAE fares in the coming months.

Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's point-man on the Middle East, has suggested that another Arab country will follow the UAE's lead. There's speculation that Bahrain and Oman will make announcements soon. Manama generally defers to Riyadh on defense and foreign policy issues, so any Bahraini normalization with Israel would serve as a trial balloon for Saudi Arabia as well. But such a Saudi move may only come after the end of the rule of King Salman, who seems committed to the API.

Formal diplomatic ties with Israel would embellish Oman's credentials as a regional mediator and a friend to all. Muscat maintains close relations with Iran, but also welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on an official visit in 2018. Oman has, in typically understated fashion, welcomed the announcement.

All three of these Gulf Arab countries have quietly been increasing relations with Israel anyway, so normalization is merely a matter of formalizing what already exists.

For Egypt, the Israeli-Emirati agreement is welcome news, not least because of their shared antipathy toward Turkey. Cairo is alarmed by Turkish ambitions, in Libya as well as the Eastern Mediterranean, and by Ankara's support for the Muslim Brotherhood. And it potentially strengthens the Egyptian-Emirati hand in Libya against Turkish-supported forces for control of the country.

The agreement, like the historical Arab antagonism toward Israel, won't mean much for the rest of North Africa. But Morocco is near the top of the list of other countries that might consider an opening with Israel.

Outside of the Arab world, the countries that will have the most to say about Thursday's announcement are Iran and Turkey, which are hostile to both Israel and the UAE. Iran has denounced the deal as ""dangerous."" It will use the agreement to score propaganda points against the UAE, portraying the Emiratis as having betrayed the Palestinian cause. But behind Tehran's bluster will be grave concern that two of its more active and potent adversaries in the region have come together under Trump's offices. Increased military and intelligence cooperation between the U.S., Israel and the UAE would indeed be dangerous for the Islamic Republic.

Things are more complicated for Turkey, which has condemned the Israeli-Emirati agreement and is threatening the suspension of diplomatic relations with the UAE. It is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seems to value his access to Trump. Turkey has trade relations with Israel and the UAE but is at cross purposes with them on most issues. Erdogan routinely lambasts Israel over Palestine, and will not take kindly to recent Israeli moves in the Eastern Mediterranean. He has also taken rhetorical aim at the UAE, for its support of the rebels in Libya (Turkey backs the government in Tripoli), its role in the embargo on Qatar (a close Turkish ally), and its hostility to the Muslim Brotherhood.

The biggest winner outside of the three parties directly involved in the agreement is surely Jordan, because it allows at least the hope of a Palestinian state in the future. That hope would have evaporated if Israel went ahead with Netanyahu's planned land-grab in the West Bank.

Palestinian refugees from the 1947-48 war and their descendants make up a majority of Jordan's citizens, but they have long adhered to a tacit understanding that they pursue their national ambitions in their former homelands, and not in the Hashemite kingdom. That could change is if a meaningful and viable state became an impossibility anywhere in the territory of historical Palestine.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Israel', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Cairo', 'Ankara', 'Amman', 'Tehran', 'Riyadh', 'Turkey', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Palestine', 'Oman', 'Mauritania', 'Jordan', 'Iran', 'Bahrain', 'Manama', 'Libya']","Who Wins, Who Loses From the Israel-UAE Agreement",https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-14/who-wins-who-loses-from-the-israel-uae-agreement,None,
11401030,2020-05-18,"Since the 2011 NATO-backed revolt in Libya that ended 42 years of rule by strongman Muammar Qaddafi, the oil-rich North African country has been in perpetual turmoil. The latest phase began in April 2019, when military commander Khalifa Haftar and his forces marched on the capital Tripoli determined to unseat the internationally backed government located there. The ongoing battle for the city has accelerated interventions in Libya by Turkey, Russia and neighboring countries as they maneuver to shape the future of the OPEC member state. More than 2000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced by the fighting for Tripoli.

Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj came to power through a 2015 United Nations-backed political deal. But a rival government set up in eastern Libya and aligned with Haftar, 76. His coalition of regular troops and militias, called the Libyan National Army, gained fame for taking the cities of Benghazi and Derna from militants affiliated with al-Qaeda. Haftar gradually extended his grip over the country's east and then the south. In April 2019, Haftar moved on the capital, and in January, allowed supporters to shut down much of the country's oil production to pressure Tripoli.

With the support of more than 1,000 Russian mercenaries, as well as Sudanese militiamen, Haftar had appeared poised to enter the capital until Turkey escalated its intervention in support of the internationally-recognized government. Turkey sent in more armed drones, surface-to-air missile defense systems, naval frigates and thousands of allied Syrian militiamen. Its allies dealt Haftar's forces a series of defeats culminating in mid-May in the capture of the strategic Watiya airbase southwest of the capital, putting Haftar on the back foot.

Haftar had been vowing for years to take Tripoli, after a failed coup attempt in 2014 forced him to set up base in the east. The UN, U.S. and other powers had hoped to stave off a Tripoli offensive by negotiating a political agreement between the two factions. Haftar's advisers said they didn't trust Sarraj to abide by a power-sharing deal that would lead to elections, and accused him of being beholden to militias and extremists. They complained that oil revenues were distributed unfairly, to the disadvantage of the historically marginalized east. Sarraj's government responds to the extremism charge by pointing to its cooperation against terrorism with the U.S. and other Western countries, and to the success of forces loyal to the government in driving Islamic State from the coastal city of Sirte in 2016. It accuses Haftar of seeking to restore military dictatorship.

Haftar has the support of the main tribes in the east and some cities in the west, including Tarhouna, which neighbors Tripoli. Sarraj's government is supported by militias in Tripoli and in neighboring Misrata, and the powerful forces of former defense minister Osama al-Juwaili from Zintan. Both sides increasingly rely on foreign patrons.

Though the U.A.E. and Egypt initially had misgivings about an offensive they predicted would turn into a quagmire, they've supported Haftar. Both see him as a reliable strongman who could end Libya's chaos, and they're opposed to some of Sarraj's Islamist allies, including the Muslim Brotherhood, which defines itself as non-violent but is considered subversive by some Middle Eastern governments. Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan embraces the Muslim Brotherhood and has enjoyed good relations with Sarraj. Turkey has secured from his government long-sought recognition for Turkish claims to a disputed gas-rich patch of the Mediterranean, unlocking a surge in military aid.

Initially, Russia kept contacts with both sides while promoting Qaddafi's son Saif as a future president. By September, however, Russia shifted to flat-out support for Haftar despite its misgivings about a figure who had connections with the CIA during a 20-year stay in the U.S. More than 1,000 mercenaries with the Wagner group, headed by a confidante of Russian President Vladimir Putin, are assisting Haftar. The U.S. had sent mixed messages to the Libyan rivals. The Russian involvement has prompted it to press more forcefully for a peace deal.

Libya sits on top of Africa's largest oil reserves. Until January, output had stabilized at more than 1 million barrels a day, still well-below the 1.6 million barrels a day produced prior to the 2011 uprising. Haftar's supporters have since shut down production, costing the Tripoli-based Central Bank billions in lost revenues.

A peace conference in Moscow in January ended with Sarraj signing a cease-fire, but Haftar refusing. Another conference in Berlin attended by world leaders secured a pledge to stop military intervention in the country, but the states backing either side have continued sending weapons and taking part in the fighting. Following its setbacks, Haftar's forces sued for a monthlong truce that was spurned by the emboldened Tripoli-based government.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'United States', 'Benghazi', 'Derna, Libya', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Zintan', 'Misrata', 'Sirte', 'Egypt']",What's Behind Nine Years of Turmoil in Libya,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-12/how-the-battle-for-libya-has-become-a-proxy-conflict-quicktake,None,

The United Arab Emirates has been involved in operating a covert air-bridge to supply weapons to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar in contravention of a United Nations arms embargo on the North African country, according to a confidential UN report.

At least 37 flights in early January are being investigated by the UN panel of experts responsible for monitoring sanctions on Libya, according to two diplomats briefed on the report that was presented to the Security Council this month. Excerpts of the report were also shared with Bloomberg. The flights were operated by a complex network of companies registered in the U.A.E., Kazakhstan, and the British Virgin Islands to disguise the delivery of military equipment, the diplomats said.

The panel found an increase in secret flights from the U.A.E. and its airbase in Eritrea to airfields under the control of Haftar, who is fighting to defeat the internationally-recognized government based in Tripoli, the report said. Some of those flights, which transfer high volumes of weapons, were operated by two Kazakhstan operators, according to the diplomats.

U.A.E. Ambassador to the United Nations Lana Nusseibeh said that while she hasn't seen the report, the allegations outlined are ""false"" and the government denies ""them in their entirety.""

""We regret such allegations are made against a State and then leaked to the press without first verifying their veracity with the State concerned,"" Nusseibeh said in emailed comments. The U.A.E. will continue to cooperate with the UN panel, she said.

The Security Council is not obligated to take any action based on the experts report but members can refer it to their home countries for investigation. There was no immediate comment from Haftar's spokesman.

What's Behind Nine Years of Turmoil in Libya: QuickTake

Sitting atop Africa's largest oil reserves, Libya has been all but ungovernable since a NATO-backed rebellion led to the 2011 killing of Moammar Qaddafi, who had ruled the country for more than 40 years. In recent years, a UN-backed government based in Tripoli has been battling for control of the divided country with Haftar's forces, which launched a campaign to take the capital a year ago.

The war has quickly descended into a proxy conflict that has drawn in regional and global powers and become a magnet for hired guns, raising concerns in Europe about the spread of militants and migrants across the Mediterranean. Egypt and the U.A.E. have backed Haftar, who is also supported by Russian mercenaries, while Turkey has begun sending troops and supplies to the Tripoli government as the conflict escalates.

Because Trump administration officials must be feeling some schadenfreude as they watch their counterparts in Moscow wrestle with a quandary all too familiar at the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom: How do you solve a problem like Recep Tayyip Erdogan?

The more philosophically-minded Russian officials may concede that turnabout is fair play: For several years now, they were the ones pointing and giggling as Turkey's president strained his country's ties with the U.S., deploying bellicose rhetoric against -- and provocative behavior toward -- American allies, from the Kurds in Syria, Israel and Greece to Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

The Russians got more than just satisfaction from Erdogan's truculence toward the U.S. President Vladimir Putin exploited the situation to weaken the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to secure lucrative business deals with Turkey, from the sale of military hardware to gas pipelines.

To preserve his status as Erdogan's new best friend, Putin indulged the Turkish leader's regional and international ambitions. Following the example of two American presidents, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, Putin feigned deafness at Erdogan's belligerent rhetoric against Russian allies, like the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and the Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar.

The Russian leader has even grinned and borne it when Erdogan's actions foiled, or at least greatly complicated, his own ambitions. A Turkish military invasion of northwestern Syria has nixed any hope in Moscow that Assad would be able to reassert control over the country. Turkish troops and mercenaries now stand in the way of Khalifa's seizure of Tripoli.

And, just as Erdogan has thumbed his nose at Washington by embracing those who chant ""Death to America"" -- whether the regime in Tehran or the leadership of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood -- Erdogan has now cocked a snook at Moscow with the incantation, ""Slava, Ukraine!"" at his recent visit to Kyiv. ""Glory to Ukraine"" has become a slogan of resistance to Russian hegemony since Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Moscow and its mouthpieces claim it is a Nazi chant.

The Russians are discovering, as Americans and Europeans have before, that with Erdogan, matters are always coming to a head, accompanied with threats to end alliances.

Putin now finds himself at the receiving end. In a recent phone call, Erdogan warned that Turkey would react ""in the harshest way"" if Turkish troops in Syria came under more attacks from Assad's forces. And of course, he has warned that the Russo-Turkish relationship could split over Syria.

Blood has now been shed on both sides. Assad's forces have stepped up attacks on Turkish positions in Idlib, killing several Turkish troops. Russia says some of its soldiers have been killed in attacks from Turkish positions. Hundreds of Syrians, soldiers and civilians alike, have been killed in the escalated fighting, and tens of thousands have been forced to flee the area, creating a new refugee crisis.

Putin's options with Erdogan are limited. Turkey is potentially a major economic partner for Russia -- the two leaders want trade between the two countries, currently at around $30 billion, to rise to $100 billion. Turkey's membership is crucial to Russia's hopes of sustaining multilateral organizations in the Caucasus and Central Asia. And of course, Putin wants to stoke NATO's uncertainty over Turkey's commitment to the alliance.

Erdogan knows all of this. If his dealings with the U.S. and Europe are any guide, he will keep pushing Russia for concessions, in Syria and Libya -- and who knows where else.

Can Washington take advantage of the situation, as Russia did when Turkey's ties to the U.S. frayed? Perhaps, but that would require Putin to push back against Erdogan, and the Turkish leader to show some interest in returning to the Western fold. We're not there yet. If we do get to that point, the U.S. would have to display diplomatic craft of a high order -- higher than it has demonstrated in recent years -- to bring Erdogan in from the cold.

For now, though, American officials can quietly revel in Putin's discovery of what it means to be Erdogan's friend.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Moscow', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Washington (state)', 'United States', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Ukraine', 'Israel', 'Greece', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Kiev']",Putin Discovers the Pain of Being Erdogan's Pal,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-07/putin-discovers-the-pain-of-being-erdogan-s-pal,None,

With the world on edge over rising tensions in the Middle East, one leader seems unfazed: Russia's Vladimir Putin.

The Russian president arrived in Damascus on Wednesday in just his second visit to Syria since the start of the country's civil war nearly nine years ago.

The timing is significant. The U.S. and its allies are on alert for retaliation for the killing of Iran's top general Qassem Soleimani. Markets are on edge and uncertainty reigns over the continued U.S. military presence in Iraq.

But Putin is pushing ahead with his own agenda in the region. The Russian president traveled from the Damascus airport to a command post of Russian forces where he met his counterpart and ally Bashar al-Assad.

""This is a clear signal to allies and opponents that when stability declines and risks rise, when uncertainty appears, Russia underlines that its presence in the Middle East is unchanging, unlike the U.S.,"" said Andrey Kortunov, director of the Russian International Affairs Council, a group with close ties to the Kremlin. ""In contrast to Donald Trump's unpredictability, Russia's consistency becomes advantageous.""

How Qassem Soleimani Helped Shape the Modern Mideast: QuickTake

Russia's 2015 military intervention in the Syrian conflict was not only key in saving the Assad regime but heralded the arrival of a new powerbroker in an already volatile and crowded region. The visit was planned in advance of a Wednesday meeting with Turkey's Recep Tayipp Erdogan, another leader who has entered the fray with his incursion in Libya.

Turkey is a NATO member, but has been courted with increasing success by Putin in recent years as Erdogan drifts further from his country's historic allies in Europe and the U.S.

With events in Iran monopolizing global attention, there is the risk of other significant developments falling under the radar, such as the capture of the coastal city of Sirte by Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar. It has a symbolic and strategic value for Haftar -- supported by Russia -- and could determine the fate of a country that has been in trapped in a cycle of civil war ever since Western allies toppled dictator Moammar Qaddafi back in 2011.

How the Battle for Libya Has Become a Proxy Conflict: QuickTake

Back in Washington, the U.S. sent its own signals that it hasn't lost its focus on the rest of the world.

Secretary of State Michael Pompeo began a relatively rare news conference on Tuesday by mentioning wildfires in Australia, China's standoff with Hong Kong protesters, Iran's role in Afghanistan, the plight of Uighurs in Xinjiang, political upheaval in Venezuela and a visit by Greece's prime minister. He even detailed his undersecretary of state's travel plans to Europe.

At the White House, Trump met the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who said the U.S. could always count on his country as ""a reliable and predictable ally.""

But that meeting only underscored how Iran was still foremost on the president's mind.

""We saved a lot of lives by terminating his life,"" Trump said of Soleimani as Mitsotakis looked on. Other countries were ""extremely happy"" with the U.S. attack, Trump added.

Russia wasn't one of those nations. The country's defense ministry called Soleimani's assassination a ""short-sighted"" step that will lead to a ""sharp escalation"" of tensions. Soleimani, the ministry said, was a ""a competent military leader, who had a well-deserved authority and significant influence throughout the Middle East.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Damascus', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Iran', 'Syria', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Iraq', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Sirte', 'Xinjiang', 'Venezuela', 'Hong Kong', 'Greece']",Putin's Trip to Syria After Iran Strike Shows Russia Unfazed,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/putin-s-trip-to-syria-after-iran-strike-shows-russia-unfazed,None,

The large decline in earnings provides signals for the rest of the industry, including BP Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp., with the worst impact of oil's historic plunge likely in the coming quarters. Investors are focused on how the companies handle one of the most turbulent periods in recent memory.

Eni said adjusted net income was 59 million euros ($63.5 million) in the quarter, compared with 992 million euros a year earlier. It sees production this year at 1.75 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, down from a previous forecast of as much as 1.84 million.

11401051,2020-02-27,"Haftar shows little patience with diplomacy to end fighting

The black smoke billowing from Tripoli's port as rival Libyan officials sat down for peace talks carried an unmistakable message to far-off Cairo and Abu Dhabi.

Shelling the facility was eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar's way of making clear he wouldn't let diplomacy in Europe halt his efforts to prevent Libya's internationally recognized government securing military assistance from its new Turkish ally.

For the rulers of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, the episode summed up the dilemma they face. They back Haftar as a bulwark against Islamist groups that prop up the Tripoli administration, and which could find succor from an expansionist Turkey. But his determination to resist outside pressure to scale back his 10-month offensive on the capital and focus on a political process risks dragging them deeper into the Libyan mire.

So the Arab states provide military aid, along with Russia, but doubting Haftar has the fire-power to win the war without unacceptable costs in lives and infrastructure have also backed negotiations, said Claudia Gazzini, a consulting analyst on Libya at International Crisis Group.

""They were trying to do with diplomacy what they had been unable to achieve on the battlefield,"" she said. The port attack last week briefly halted United Nations-supported talks but they have since stumbled on.

Haftar has long been an intransigent leader, with little patience for the messy compromises of negotiation. He has consistently signaled he sees ending opposition to his march on Tripoli as the only way to restore stability in a country that's important to European security and sits atop Africa's largest oil reserves. The nation's only functioning international airport is shut more than open as a result of repeated shelling by Haftar's forces.

""An end to hostilities depends on a number of conditions,"" Haftar told Russian state news service RIA Novosti on Friday after talks in Moscow. ""A withdrawal of Syrian and Turkish mercenaries, stopping Turkish arms supplies to Tripoli and wiping out terrorist groups.""

What's Behind Nine Years of Turmoil in Libya: QuickTake

The U.A.E. has struggled with other recent military forays. In 2015, it joined the Saudi-led war to restore a friendly regime in Yemen only to announce a pull-out late last year with most of its objectives still far from achieved.

But for the country's ruling family, Turkey's intervention in Libya was a game changer, said a Western diplomat based in the Gulf.

Abu Dhabi doesn't want to see a Libya where the balance of power is held by hard-line Islamist militias, the diplomat said, offering the opportunity for such groups and the Muslim Brotherhood movement to grow in influence. Most hereditary Gulf rulers have a deep-seated antagonism to political Islam based on popular franchise, and many have banned the Brotherhood.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party embrace the movement, and the U.A.E. watched with concern as Turkey reinforced ties with Qatar after it was ostracized by a Gulf Arab-led alliance in 2017, in part over its policy toward Islamists.

Turkish soldiers are training forces loyal to Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, and Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have also joined the conflict. The country has suffered its first fatalities in Libya, with two soldiers confirmed killed.

The U.A.E.'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter this month that his country was aiming for ""a political solution that addresses the threat of extremism and terrorism in Libya.""

Egypt shares a 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) frontier with Libya that would be vulnerable to spiraling violence, and Cairo has invested greater efforts in finding a political solution. Its leader, Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, was prominent in a huddle of global leaders at talks on Libya in Berlin in January.

Yet it still sees Haftar's Libyan National Army as the best way to protect the border and halt Erdogan's drive into the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean, waters where Egypt is trying to move ahead with plans to become a regional gas exporter, said Mohamed Anis Salem at the Egypt Council of Foreign Relations.

""It's difficult to see Egypt standing back as long as the situation in Libya is not stabilized,"" he said

Forces fighting with Haftar control the majority of Libya's territory as well as its key oil facilities, and are on the outskirts of the capital.

""We're not supporting him or his vision for Libya,"" Hussein Haridy, a former deputy Egyptian foreign minister, said of Haftar. ""What we're supporting is his protection of the western border.""

But, Haridy points out, that approach has opened the door to Turkish involvement in the war and might need reconsidering.

""As far as Egypt is concerned, maybe its time for a deep reassessment of policies in Libya,"" he said. ""We have to review what we have achieved so far. We have to look at the new threat coming out of Libya -- out of the stalemate.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Russia', 'Egypt', 'Moscow', 'Cairo', 'Syria', 'Berlin', 'Yemen', 'Qatar']",Arabs Flex Muscles and Talk as Erdogan Ups Ante in Libya's War,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-27/arabs-flex-muscles-and-talk-as-erdogan-ups-ante-in-libya-s-war,None,

11401114,2020-04-27,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya's eastern-based military leader Khalifa Haftar said on Monday his Libyan National Army (LNA) was accepting a ""popular mandate"" to rule the country, apparently brushing aside the civilian authorities that nominally govern eastern Libya.

Haftar, who launched a war a year ago to grab the capital Tripoli and other parts of northwest Libya, was already widely understood to control the parallel administration that rules in the east.

He did not spell out in his brief televised speech on Monday what form the new power structure would take and the wider political ramifications were not immediately clear.

Libya has been split since 2014 between areas controlled by the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and the northwest, and territory held by eastern-based forces in Benghazi.

""We announce that the general command is answering the will of the people, despite the heavy burden and the many obligations and the size of the responsibility, and we will be subject to the people's wish,"" he said.

Although the LNA advanced last year into the southern suburbs of Tripoli, and has been bombarding the capital frequently, it lost ground to pro-GNA forces during fighting this month.

Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. The GNA is backed by Turkey.

Though Haftar had long been the de facto ruler of eastern Libya, power was nominally held by a civilian administration. Benghazi is home to parallel state institutions, as well as the national parliament.

The GNA falls under a three-man Presidential Council, founded in 2015 in a political agreement aimed at ending the chaos and division that have persisted since the 2011 uprising that ousted Muammar Gaddafi.

Haftar said last week that the agreement had failed.

11401115,2020-04-22,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognised government is focused on trying to push its enemies out of artillery range of Tripoli after making advances in the main western battle fronts last week, the interior minister said.

Driving the forces of commander Khalifa Haftar out of the town of Tarhouna, southeast of the capital, could end Libya's civil war, minister Fathi Bashagha told Reuters by phone.

But this would be ""the most difficult military option"" at this moment in the Government of National Accord's (GNA) fight against eastern-based Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), Bashagha said.

""All our focus is on how to protect Tripoli and the people of Tripoli and keep the artillery bombardment away from them,"" he said.

During a news conference in Tripoli later on Wednesday, Bashagha said there had been initial reports of chemical weapons use against GNA forces and he was awaiting further details.

Tarhouna, surrounded by hills, has been the LNA's main strategic centre in the west, providing local manpower for a campaign that has leaned heavily on air support supplied by the United Arab Emirates and Russian military contractors.

Pro-GNA forces made advances last week in the main fronts in western Libya, taking back territory along the coast and then pushing towards the LNA's main support base at Tarhouna, 65 km (45 miles) from the capital.

It marked a possible turning point in the year-long war between the GNA and the LNA, which launched an offensive in April 2019 to capture Tripoli and has been bombarding the capital for weeks.

LNA forces already control eastern Libya, where a rival administration to the GNA rules in Benghazi, and much of the country's south. However, Libya's main institutions, including the oil company and central bank, are based in Tripoli.

The GNA's overall strategy is to regain control over western Libya, Bashagha said. He added that no military solution to the conflict was possible, but it was also not possible to negotiate with Haftar.

""As for Tarhouna, this is the most difficult military option to storm because it is the first focal and rallying point (for the LNA). By entering Tarhouna, we believe that the war would end because no other city (in western Libya) is considered a gathering point for Haftar's forces,"" Bashagha said.

Diplomatic peacemaking efforts have run aground and the United Nations special envoy resigned in March citing ill health.

Turkish military support for the GNA this year, particularly with air defences and drones, was crucial in its latest advances.

The United Nations Libya mission said on Tuesday that at least 3,100 people had been displaced from their homes in Tarhouna and the nearby GNA-held town of Qarabouli, this week as the fighting escalated.

The U.N. earlier warned flight restrictions by commander Khalifa Haftar's forces known as Libya National Army (LNA) were hampering humanitarian and mediation efforts in the oil producing country embroiled in a conflict between loose alliances from western and eastern Libya since 2014.

The LNA, which is backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, has been trying since last April to take Tripoli but has failed to breach the city's defences.

But it has air superiority thanks to UAE-supplied combat drones, which cover the whole of Libya via a satellite link, a U.N. report said in November.

LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told reporters in the eastern city of Benghazi that the United Nations would have to use other airports such as Misrata because it could not guarantee the safety of flights into Tripoli Mitiga airport as Turkey was using it as a base.

Turkey has supplied combat drones to Tripoli operating in the past out of Mitiga and also sophisticated air defences for the capital.

The U.N. mission in Libya (UNSMIL) earlier said the LNA had in the past three weeks several times blocked U.N. flights carrying staff to and from Libya.

A humanitarian source said that Haftar was imposing a ""no-fly zone"" for Tripoli and there were concerns that U.N. flights could be a possible target.

U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame has been mediating between Haftar and the Tripoli government.

Relations have been difficult as UNSMIL has condemned air strikes blamed on the LNA, though mostly without mentioning the force by name.

Ties worsened when the U.N. said in a report last month that Haftar's main stronghold Benghazi had turned into a ""hub for illicit economic activities, including the sale of drugs and arms."" The U.N. also criticized activities of armed groups in western Libya.

Turkey's parliament voted on Thursday to allow troops to be sent to support the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, deepening fears of more fighting, though analysts and officials said Ankara was unlikely to immediately put boots on the ground.

The GNA has sought Turkey's support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's forces, which control the east and swept through southern Libya in early 2019.

Haftar's forces said they had carried out air strikes in several places on Friday, including south of the city of Sirte and in Tripoli. Sirte lies in the center of Libya's coastline, on the dividing line between the warring factions.

An increase in air strikes and shelling in and around Tripoli has caused the deaths of at least 11 civilians since early December and shut down health facilities and schools, the U.N. mission in Libya said.

Haftar's Tripoli offensive quickly stalled in the outskirts of the city, but led to increased international involvement in the conflict. Turkey has backed the GNA while Haftar has received support from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan.

Russian military contractors have also been deployed with Haftar's Libyan National Army for several months, diplomats and analysts said.

There were protests in several cities and towns in eastern Libya against the Turkish parliament's decision.

In Benghazi, where about 3,000 people took to the streets, protesters said they had turned out to oppose a Turkish ""invasion"" of Libya, which was part of the Ottoman Empire before coming under Italian occupation.

Haftar later gave a televised speech in which he announced a ""call to arms and mass mobilization ... to defend our land and our honor"".

Three subsidiaries of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) which operate in areas under Haftar's control - Ras Lanuf Oil and Gas Company, Sirte Oil Co and Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) - said they would boycott Turkish companies.

11401307,2020-05-06,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russian private military contractor Wagner Group has up to 1,200 people deployed in Libya, strengthening the forces of eastern-based military leader Khalifa Haftar, according to a confidential United Nations report seen by Reuters on Wednesday.

The 57-page report by independent sanctions monitors, submitted to the U.N. Security Council Libya sanctions committee, said the Russian contractor deployed forces in specialized military tasks, including sniper teams.

Haftar launched a war a year ago to grab the capital Tripoli and other parts of northwest Libya. Since 2014, Libya has been split between areas controlled by the internationally recognized Government of National Accord in Tripoli and the northwest, and territory held by Haftar's eastern-based forces in Benghazi.

Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey. The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Libya in 2011 amid an uprising that ousted longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.

The sanctions monitors said that while they could not independently verify the scale of the deployment to Libya by Wagner Group, ""based on open source reporting and the limited sightings assesses that the maximum number of individual private military operatives deployed to be no more than 800 to 1,200.""

""Their deployment has acted as an effective force multiplier for (Haftar),"" the sanctions monitors wrote.

When asked in January if the Wagner Group were fighting in Libya, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that if there are Russians in Libya, they are not representing the Russian state, nor are they paid by the state.

Wagner Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Russian private military contractors have clandestinely fought in support of Russian forces in Syria and Ukraine, Reuters and other media have previously reported. The Russian state denies it uses private military contractors abroad.

The U.N. sanctions monitors identified more than two dozen flights between Russia and eastern Libya from August 2018 to August 2019 by civilian aircraft ""strongly linked to, or owned by"" Wagner Group or related companies.

The monitors also listed the details of 122 Wagner operatives of ""whom many are highly probably operational, or have been operational, within Libya."" They said 39 were from Wagner's specialist sniper group and the remaining 83 operatives were from Wagner combat units.

The report said forces affiliated with the Government of National Accord had captured arms ""typical of the weaponry observed being used by ChVK Wagner operatives elsewhere in eastern Ukraine and Syria.""

The monitors are also investigating social media reports that a six-month contract between Wagner and Haftar ended on Oct. 15 last year and accusations that by this time Hafter had only paid half of the more $173 million owed.

Across Wagner Group, personnel are predominantly Russian, but also include citizens of Belarus, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine, the report said. It also said they have been identified using equipment typically reserved for Russia's armed forces.

When asked about the use of private military contractors in Libya on Wednesday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said it was a matter of concern for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

11401308,2020-01-02,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill that allows troop deployment in Libya, in a move that paves the way for further military cooperation between Ankara and Tripoli but is unlikely to see boots on the ground immediately.

President Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling party and nationalist allies hold a majority in parliament, said last week Turkey would deploy troops in Libya to support Fayez al-Serraj's internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).

The GNA last month requested Turkish support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's forces to the east of the country, which are backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan.

The move comes after Ankara and the GNA signed two separate agreements in November: one on security and military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, a move that infuriated Greece, Israel, Egypt and Cyprus.

Almost immediately after the vote, Egypt's foreign ministry said it strongly condemned the parliament's decision, and called on the international community to urgently respond to the move.

The bill, opposed by all major opposition parties, passed with an 315-184 vote. Opposition parties said the move may exacerbate conflicts in Libya and endanger Turkish soldiers in the region and Turkey's national security.

But Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the bill was an important step for protecting Ankara's interests in North Africa and the Mediterranean, and for achieving peace and stability in Libya.

In a statement to Reuters, the GNA's interior minister Fathi Bashagha said Tripoli had requested Turkish support following a ""dangerous escalation"" in the conflict by Haftar's forces.

""As Libya's only legitimate and sovereign government, the GNA is the singular entity with the right to formalize military alliances necessary to safeguard our nation,"" Bashagha said, adding that the GNA aimed to stop a ""war criminal"" from seizing power and establish stability, security and democracy in Libya.

Dmitry Novikov, a Russian lawmaker, said after the vote that a Turkish military presence in Libya would ""only deteriorate the situation"", according to the Interfax news agency.

Later on Thursday, Erdogan discussed Libya with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call, the Turkish presidency said without providing more details. Erdogan is due to discuss Libya with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month.

Ankara has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report seen by Reuters. It has also said it would help prevent Libya sliding into ""chaos"" and that it will provide any support it can.

But analysts and some officials say Ankara is unlikely to immediately deploy troops, instead sending military advisers and equipment first.

""The hope would be that the Turkish military may not itself be involved in military action,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is chairman of the think-tank Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.

Last week, a senior Turkish official said Ankara could train Libyan soldiers in Turkey, and Reuters reported that Turkey may also consider sending allied Syrian fighters to Tripoli as part of the planned military support. [nL8N2942R3]

On Wednesday, Vice President Fuat Oktay said the bill served a symbolic role that Ankara hoped would be a ""deterrent"" to the parties, and that Turkey may not send troops if Haftar's forces halted their offensive and pulled back.

The maritime agreement between Ankara and Tripoli has ended Turkey's isolation in the eastern Mediterranean, where it is at odds with Greece over resources off Cyprus. Greece has said the accord violates international law, but Ankara rejects this, and says it only wants to protect its rights.

Greece, Cyprus and Israel are expected to sign a deal to build a 1,900 km (1,180 mile) subsea pipeline to carry natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean to Europe, but analysts say the accord between Turkey and Libya could present a barrier to the plans.

""Ankara sees its involvement in Libya as a symbol of its new status as a regional power,"" said Asli Aydintasbas, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Turkey said its accords are meant to protect Turkish private investment in Libya and bolster its energy claims in the eastern Mediterranean.

But it could also put Turkey at odds with the other foreign players in Libya's war and in the region.

11401502,2020-10-11,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Turkey's army in Qatar is an element of instability in the Gulf region, a senior official of the United Arab Emirates has said, adding that it contributed to negative polarisation.

The UAE and its Arab allies have imposed a boycott on Qatar since mid-2017 and had demanded that Doha close a Turkish military base, among their conditions for ending the rift. Abu Dhabi and Ankara also back opposing sides in Libya's conflict.

""The Turkish military presence in the Arab Gulf is an emergency,"" Anwar Gargash, the UAE's state minister for foreign affairs, said on Twitter on Saturday.

""It reinforces polarisation, and it does not take into account the sovereignty of states and the interests of the Gulf countries and its people.""

The United States, seeking a united Gulf front against Iran, has tried to resolve the row in which Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and non-Gulf Egypt severed political, trade and travel links with Qatar over accusations that it backs militants and is cosying up to regional foe Iran.

Doha, which hosts the region's largest U.S. military base, denies the accusations and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty.

On Friday, the State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, David Schenker, said there may be some progress in resolving the rift within weeks, citing signs of ""flexibility in negotiations"", ahead of U.S. elections.

Diplomats and Gulf sources have confirmed talks between Riyadh and Doha after negotiations that broke down early this year, but there have been no signs yet of a breakthrough.

11401504,2020-07-27,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Spain's foreign minister said that talks in Turkey on Monday had helped to reduce tensions between some European Union members and Ankara over Turkish energy exploration in the Mediterranean, adding that a one-month pause in drilling was possible.

Foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya, at a news conference in Ankara with Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, said an ""inflexion point"" had been reached on the dispute over drilling for oil and gas in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

Turkey is at loggerheads with Greece and Cyprus over overlapping claims for offshore reserves and the two EU members, along with France, have rejected Turkey's plan to explore between Cyprus and Crete.

Paris and Athens have called for sanctions against Turkey for what they view as an encroachment on Greek and Cypriot waters, while Berlin has warned Ankara to cease ""provocations"". Turkey has rejected the criticism and said it is abiding by international law.

The Turkish lira has, meanwhile, slipped to near a record low versus the euro.

""We have reached some inflexion point mainly on the drilling in the eastern Mediterranean and this was a useful dialogue with Mevlut to deescalate tensions that exist,"" Gonzalez Laya said.

""I think his will to pause exploration for at least a month to give space to dialogue between parties is a signal of confidence,"" she said.

Cavusoglu did not mention any plans to pause, and Turkey's foreign ministry was not immediately available to comment.

Last week Turkey's navy issued an advisory for seismic surveys at sea in a move Greece said was an attempt to encroach on its continental shelf. The Turkish research ship is still anchored outside Antalya.

Turkey and Greece are at loggerheads over overlapping claims for natural gas reserves, brought into sharp focus by attempts of EU member Cyprus to explore for gas in the Eastern Mediterranean amid strong Turkish objections. [nL5N2ES6F8]

Macron's comments came after Turkey's navy on Tuesday issued an advisory for seismic surveys in an area of sea between Cyprus and Crete, a move Greece said was an attempt by Ankara to encroach on its continental shelf.

It also comes as relations between Paris and Ankara, two NATO allies, fray, with Paris repeatedly pointing the finger at Ankara over its role in Libya.

""I stand fully behind Cyprus and Greece in the face of the Turkish violations of their sovereignty. It is unacceptable that the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened,"" Macron told reporters alongside his Cypriot counterpart, Nicos Anastasiades.

""Those who are doing that must be sanctioned.""

He said it would be a ""serious mistake"" for the EU to not respond.

Ibrahim Kal?n, chief adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, told a think-tank event in Brussels on Thursday: ""Using the language of threats of sanctions will never fly here and will have no impact on Turkey's sovereignty or determination in pursuing the national interest.""

On July 13, EU foreign ministers agreed to prepare additional listings within the existing sanctions framework on Turkey's drilling in the Eastern Mediterranean, as requested by Cyprus.

Macron has also criticised Turkey for months over Ankara's role in Libya, and on Thursday said the EU should now push for sanctions. He did not identify nations or people that should be penalised for their involvement in the North African country's conflict.

""It (sanctions) is necessary to obtain a ceasefire and begin a real dynamic towards a political solution to the Libyan conflict,"" he said.

Russia and Turkey are the key players in Libya's conflict, where they support opposing sides. Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt back the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar, while Turkey has helped the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) repel Haftar's attempt to storm the capital.

11401520,2020-04-29,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya's eastern-based forces will cease fire for Ramadan, their spokesman said on Wednesday, after they suffered setbacks during weeks of intense fighting against the internationally recognized government.

Libyan National Army (LNA) spokesman Ahmed Mismari said in a television broadcast that the ceasefire came at the request of the international community and ""friendly countries"".

Both the LNA and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) have already said twice this year that they would stop fighting, but there was a sharp escalation in warfare last month.

Libya has been split since 2014 between the GNA in Tripoli and some other areas of the northwest, and a parallel administration based in Benghazi in the east.

LNA commander Khalifa Haftar launched a war a year ago to capture Tripoli, but pro-GNA forces have this month taken back several areas with Turkish military support, particularly through drones that have targeted eastern supply lines.

The LNA, which is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt, has for weeks been shelling the capital in a campaign of bombardment that has drawn repeated rebukes from the United Nations.

Hospitals in parts of Tripoli held by the GNA have repeatedly been hit by shelling in recent weeks, despite the threat to Libya posed by the coronavirus.

Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday the LNA had last year targeted a biscuit factory, killing eight civilians in an attack it called ""apparently unlawful"". The LNA has not commented on that report.

There was no immediate GNA response to the LNA's declaration of a ceasefire, but Mismari said the eastern-based forces would reserve the right to respond to attacks. Ramadan, Islam's holy fasting month, began last week.

It comes at a moment of political uncertainty in the eastern camp, with Haftar declaring on Monday that the army would take power and ripping up a 2015 political agreement that has been the basis for all international peacemaking efforts.

Egypt and Russia, two of the LNA's main supporters, have declined either to endorse or reject the move, with Haftar having yet to spell out how the new government would operate or what relation it would have to the eastern-based parliament.

Haftar is already widely regarded as controlling eastern Libya despite the nominal governance of a civilian administration.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that ""we do not approve of the statement that now field marshal Haftar will alone decide how the Libyan people will live,"" but tempered his remarks with criticism of the GNA.

Egypt, which sees Haftar as a bulwark against their common enemy the Muslim Brotherhood, stressed the necessity of a political solution to Libya's conflict.

11401521,2020-04-18,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Forces aligned with Libya's internationally recognised government said they had advanced on Saturday on Tarhouna, a key support base for their eastern-based rival Khalifa Haftar.

The advance comes days after forces loyal to the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) had pushed back Haftar's allies along the coast west of the capital, marking a possible turning point in their attempt to fend off a year-long offensive by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).

Tarhouna, about 65 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital, Tripoli, has been a crucial asset for the LNA, providing local manpower for a campaign that has leaned heavily on air support supplied by the United Arab Emirates as well as Russian military contractors.

GNA attempts to swing Tarhouna to its side have failed. The GNA has depended on military support including drone strikes provided by Turkey, which has stepped up its involvement in Libya's conflict this year.

One witness from Tarhouna said residents had heard loud blasts from Saturday morning, followed by the sound of intensive clashes in an outlying area of the town that continued for up to six hours.

LNA officials told Reuters the GNA forces had failed to enter the town and that the offensive, the first since Haftar launched his military bid for Tripoli in early April 2019, had been repelled. They also said they had shot down a drone.

LNA forces control eastern and southern Libya and have been positioned around the outskirts of Tripoli for a year. The capital has seen heavy bombardment in recent days, and shelling continued on Saturday, wounding at least 10 civilians, local medics said.

The GNA has also been trying to capture al-Watiya airbase, about 125 km (80 miles) southwest of Tripoli and the LNA's other strategic foothold in Tripoli.

Libya is struggling to prepare for the expected spread of the new coronavirus, and the GNA on Friday imposed a 24-hour curfew in western regions it controls for 10 days. Libya has confirmed 49 cases, including one death.

11401522,2020-04-13,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament on Tuesday passed a law that will allow the release of tens of thousands of prisoners to ease overcrowding in jails and protect detainees from the coronavirus, but which critics slam for excluding those jailed on terrorism charges.

President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party and nationalist MHP allies supported the bill, which was accepted with 279 votes for and 51 votes against, deputy parliament speaker Sureyya Sadi Bilgic said.

The law will open the way for the temporary release of around 45,000 prisoners to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Those eligible will be released under judicial control until the end of May and the Justice Ministry will be able to extend the period three times by a maximum of two months each time, according to the law.

A similar number would be released permanently under a separate part of the legislation aimed at reducing prison overcrowding.

Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said on Monday there were 17 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among prisoners, including three deaths, and 79 prison personnel had also tested positive.

The law has been criticised by opposition parties and activists for excluding those jailed on terrorism charges, which include journalists and politicians swept up in a crackdown following a coup attempt in 2016.

Opposition members say the release of criminals including thieves, racketeers and those involved in bribery could lead to a rise in crime.

Violations of Turkey's intelligence law are not eligible for earlier release, which opposition members said aimed to exclude journalists imprisoned earlier this year for reporting the death of Turkish intelligence members in Libya's conflict.

Turkey has arrested thousands of academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants and members of the military it says were supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who it blames for the coup attempt. Gulen denies any involvement.

Many Kurdish activists and politicians the state says have links to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) are also in jail.

Amnesty International welcomed the steps to reduce overcrowding in prisons but said the law failed to cover others who should be considered for release.

""Those convicted in unfair trials under Turkey's overly broad anti-terrorism laws are also now condemned to face the prospect of infection from this deadly disease,"" Amnesty campaigner Milena Buyum said.

""Turkey's government must do the right thing and immediately release those who are imprisoned solely for expressing their peaceful views,"" she said.

Critics of Turkey's judiciary say court rulings are influenced by politicians. Erdogan and his AK Party say the judges make decisions independently.

Under the crackdown since 2016, the number of prisoners has risen to nearly 300,000 - the second-largest prison population in Europe and the most overcrowded prison system as of January 2019, according to data from the Council of Europe.

Around 50,000 people convicted or jailed pending trial on terrorism charges, including members of the PKK and Gulen's network, are excluded from the new law, according to an opposition parliamentarian.

Turan Aydogan, parliamentarian from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), said the law should have been designed to protect freedom of thought.

11401523,2020-04-08,"TUNIS, April 8 (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognised prime minister Fayez al-Serraj on Wednesday said Central Bank of Libya governor Sadiq al-Kabir was to blame for the recent non-payment of salaries to state workers and the non-issuance of letters of credit.

Friction between Serraj and Kabir threatens to undermine the Tripoli government as it fends off a military assault, deals with a blockade of its main oil exports, and prepares to handle a coronavirus outbreak.

Serraj said on al-Rasmiya television channel that he had ""tried to avoid a war of words with the Central Bank of Libya, but things have really crossed all lines"".

He said the bank had to hold a board meeting, something that would bring together directors from across the divide of Libya's conflict, in order to discuss changes he said Kabir seeks in the exchange rate.

Analysts say a meeting of the board, which has more members aligned with the east than with Tripoli, could provide eastern authorities with a chance to try to achieve their long-standing goal of having Kabir replaced.

Since 2014, Libya has been split between competing governments and military alliances based in Tripoli and the east, a division that has been reflected in the central bank and the National Oil Corporation.

Serraj is head of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations and controls the capital and some other parts of the northwest.

For the past year, the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar has been trying to capture Tripoli. Eastern forces have this year imposed an oil blockade, cutting off Libya's main source of revenue.

The Tripoli-based NOC is the only legitimate exporter of Libyan oil and payments are made through the Tripoli-based central bank. Despite the territorial split, the bank still funds the salaries of most state employees across Libya.

However, many state employees have not been paid this year.

""There is the problem of salaries. Two, three months without justification. The Central Bank did not accept salaries,"" Serraj said.

Letters of credit needed for imports have also not been issued. Serraj accused the central bank of closing the credit system and not informing his government.

The bank said in a statement last week that it had promptly executed salaries for January-March of this year and that the main cause of the financial and economic crisis was the GNA's failure to resolve the oil blockade.

His current Libya envoy Ghassan Salame quit last week due to stress, days after his latest effort at peacemaking failed to achieve a breakthrough in the conflict. Salame was appointed in mid-2017 to replace German diplomat Martin Kobler, after an unusually contentious search for a candidate.

Guterres had initially chosen former Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad in 2017 to be the U.N. Libya envoy and formally notified the 15-member U.N. Security Council of the appointment in a letter.

Traditionally, the Security Council then approves such a move by consensus by writing back to the secretary-general and ""taking note"" of the appointment. However, the United States objected to Fayyad because he was Palestinian.

Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Guterres has informally consulted with some council members about appointing Lamamra, but has not yet sent a formal letter. Diplomats said most council members supported the appointment.

Libya has faced internal strife since the 2011 uprising that ousted longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi, and the latest round of violence began last year when eastern-based forces began to advance on the capital Tripoli.

Ghassan Salame said on Twitter that he had ""sought for two and a half years to unite Libyans, prevent foreign intervention and preserve the unity of the country"", but ""my health no longer allows me to take this much stress"".

Last week he brought representatives of the two main sides in Libya's conflict to Geneva for peace talks, but key representatives suspended their involvement.

By the end of last week, shelling in Tripoli had again intensified into some of the heaviest bombardments since Salame brokered a ceasefire on January 12.

Libya has faced internal strife since the 2011 uprising that ousted longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi, and the latest round of violence began last year when eastern-based forces began to advance on the capital Tripoli.

Salame was appointed in mid-2017 to replace German diplomat Martin Kobler, after an unusually long and contentious search for a candidate.

Widely respected by diplomats, Salame's appointment gave fresh impetus to peace efforts, though early attempts to broker a political deal between rival factions soon stalled.

After a plan to hold elections at the end of 2018 was derailed by continuing violence and deadlock between competing rump parliaments, Salame focused the U.N.'s work on preparing for a national conference based on open meetings across Libya.

But 10 days before it was due to take place in April 2019, eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar launched an assault on Tripoli, upending the plans.

The fighting also reversed progress in moving U.N. operations back to Tripoli from Tunis, where much of the international community had been based since 2014.

More recently, Salame railed against escalating foreign intervention as Haftar's offensive continued, urging foreign states to respect an arms embargo that has been routinely violated and trying to unite the international community behind a truce.

But those attempts proved largely in vain as powers including the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Russia vied for influence and Western involvement waned.

11401526,2020-02-24,"GENEVA/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Lawmakers based in areas of eastern Libya controlled by military commander Khalifa Haftar said on Monday they would not participate for now in peace talks with politicians allied to the internationally recognized government.

The eastern politicians said the United Nations, which is brokering the talks in Geneva, had not approved all the members of their proposed delegation.

The lawmakers' refusal is the latest blow to U.N. efforts to end an almost year-long offensive by Haftar's forces aimed at taking the capital Tripoli.

The United Nations had planned to bring together lawmakers from both sides of Libya's conflict on Wednesday to end the fighting over Tripoli as part of a dialogue encompassing military, political and economic strands.

Libya's internationally recognized government based in Tripoli meanwhile described Haftar as a ""war criminal"" and demanded that he withdraw his forces threatening the capital.

The government, which nearly walked out of the Geneva talks last week, blamed Haftar's forces for shelling Tripoli's port shortly after the negotiations got underway.

Senior military figures on both sides on Sunday agreed to submit a draft ceasefire agreement to their leaderships before meeting again next month, the U.N. Libya mission, UNSMIL, said in a statement.

The eastern lawmakers refused to take part in Wednesday's talks as UNSMIL had approved only eight of their 13 delegates, Ahmaida Erouhma, head of the Geneva committee at the eastern parliament, told reporters in the eastern city of Benghazi.

UNSMIL spokesman Jean El Alam said the talks would go ahead as scheduled but declined to comment specifically on the participation of either side.

""Many participants have already arrived in Geneva and we hope all invited participants follow suit,"" he said.

The two sides have so far been seated in separate rooms, with U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame shuttling between them.

The Tripoli government insisted that Haftar must pull back his troops from front lines around Tripoli, foreign affairs minister Mohamed Syala told journalists.

Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj earlier called Haftar a ""war criminal"" at a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.

""Children have lost their right to education due to the shelling and the closure of schools because of the attacker and those who fund the attacker and provide weapons, these must be held accountable,"" Serraj said.

Nearly nine years since NATO-backed rebels overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is still without a central authority in control of its towns and cities. Armed groups patrol the streets, while rival governments are in place in Tripoli and the east.

11401527,2020-02-03,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Military officers from rival factions in Libya's conflict began U.N.-led talks in Geneva on Monday aimed at securing a ceasefire after 10 months of fighting on the outskirts of the capital, Tripoli.

The so-called ""Libyan Joint Military Commission"" includes five senior officers from eastern commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) and five officers aligned with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).

Haftar has been waging an offensive since April to take control of Tripoli, where the GNA is based. The fighting has displaced more than 150,000 people and drawn increasing involvement by foreign powers.

The military talks were taking place two weeks after an international summit in Berlin that was focussed on charting a path toward a political solution and enforcing a U.N. arms embargo that has been routinely violated.

Haftar has received material support from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, and Russia, according to U.N. experts and diplomats, while the government is backed militarily by Turkey.

The LNA had delayed appointing representatives for the military talks, but appears to have come round to participating after Turkey supplied air defense systems that blunted the air advantage enjoyed by Haftar and his backers, diplomats said.

Haftar's offensive, which upended a previous U.N. peace plan, deepened the gulf between loose alliances that have competed for power from western and eastern Libya since 2014.

There was an escalation in fighting late last year, and a truce brokered by Russia and Turkey from Jan. 12 has been repeatedly violated.

The United Nations says weapons and fighters have continued to enter Libya since the Berlin meeting, and groups loyal to Haftar have imposed a blockade on major oil ports and fields that has shut off most of Libya's oil production.

The Geneva talks are aimed at trust building and working out a monitoring mechanism for a ceasefire, diplomats said. The Geneva talks are being moderated by U.N.

11401528,2020-01-30,"CAIRO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it was suspending operations at a refugee center in Libya's capital because it could become a target while the U.N. envoy said a truce brokered by Russia and Turkey was holding ""only in name"".

Artillery exchanges in Tripoli have significantly increased in recent days, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told the Security Council in a briefing, causing an increase in civilian casualties due to indiscriminate shelling.

Since Jan. 12, when forces aligned with Tripoli's internationally recognized government and eastern based rivals led by Khalifa Haftar conditionally agreed to a truce, more than 110 violations had been recorded, Salame said.

Libya's conflict has escalated since Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli in April, upending U.N.-led peace plans. International powers have supplied arms and air power, though there has been a lull in air strikes since Russia and Turkey called for a truce starting Jan. 12, and international powers met in Berlin on Jan. 19 trying to broker a ceasefire.

Haftar has received support from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Russia and Egypt, while Turkey has recently stepped up its backing for the Tripoli government.

U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the Security Council that ""regrettably the promise of the Berlin conference is already under threat"". It was ""past time"" for those violating an arms embargo ""to face real consequences"", she warned, without giving details.

The 15-member U.N. Security Council has been negotiating a British-drafted resolution to endorse the outcomes of the Berlin conference, but it was not immediately clear when the text could be put to a vote.

The U.N. says arms and fighters have continued to pour into Libya despite pledges in Berlin to uphold the arms embargo, while clashes have picked up on the ground with at least 18 civilians killed and three wounded in and around Tripoli since Jan. 6.

""With recent developments on the ground, I regret to report that the truce holds only in name,"" Salame said.

The closure of the center for refugees and asylum seekers in central Tripoli may further restrict protection for migrants frequently subjected to abuse including torture and forced labor, both in and out of detention.

The UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF), which housed nearly 1,000 people, had been plagued with problems, reflecting the difficulties for international agencies working in a city controlled by armed groups.

""Unfortunately UNHCR was left with no choice but to suspend work at the (GDF) after learning that training exercises, involving police and military personnel, are taking place just a few meters away from units housing asylum seekers and refugees,"" Jean-Paul Cavalieri, UNHCR's Libya head, said in a statement.

""We fear that the entire area could become a military target, further endangering the lives of refugees, asylum seekers, and other civilians.""

Libya's western coast has been one of the main departure points for migrants attempting dangerous sea crossings to Europe, though the number of departures has dropped sharply since mid-2017.

The country has a migrant population numbering hundreds of thousands, and several thousand are held in detention centers in or near Tripoli that have been left unguarded or hit by artillery or air strikes amid the fighting.

In July, an air strike hit a detention center in Tripoli's Tajoura district that was located in the same complex as an armed group's vehicle repair workshop, killing at least 53 migrants.

By Aidan Lewis

CAIRO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Libya's largest oil field and a second major field in the southwest began shutting down on Sunday after forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Haftar closed a pipeline connecting them to the coast, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said.

The closure, which comes after a blockade of major eastern oil ports, risked taking nearly all the country's oil output offline as international leaders met in Berlin for a peace summit on Libya.

Libya has been producing around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in recent months, and all major fields lie in areas controlled by Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).

The NOC said guards under LNA command had shut down the pipeline leading to the coastal city of Zawiya on Sunday, forcing the corporation to limit oil production at the Sharara and El Feel oil fields.

El Sharara, operated by the NOC in a joint venture with Spain's Repsol, France's Total, Austria's OMV and Norway's Equinor has production of around 300,000 bpd. El Feel, operated by the NOC and Italy's Eni produces about 70,000 bpd.

Haftar's LNA has been waging an offensive since April to capture the capital, Tripoli. It is one of two main factions that international powers want to agree to a ceasefire in Berlin on Sunday.

Ahead of the summit, oil ports and oilfields in Libya's east were shut down, closures that the NOC said were directly ordered by the LNA and would lead to the loss of 800,000 bpd.

The move was seen as a pressure tactic ahead of the summit, though the LNA has sought to portray it as the result of popular pressure.

Eastern groups aligned with the LNA have long tried to gain control over oil exports and revenues, which are channelled through the central bank and the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.

The Tripoli-based NOC, which says it is neutral and deals with all parties in Libya's conflict, has warned that any shutdowns could have a lasting impact.

""The oil and gas sector is the lifeblood of the Libyan economy and the single source of income for the Libyan people,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said on Friday.

11401533,2020-01-09,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Forces in East Libya led by Khalifa Haftar said on Thursday they will not let up in their military campaign against rival factions in the capital Tripoli, appearing to reject a call by Russia and Turkey for a ceasefire.

A statement from Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) welcomed Russia's bid ""to seek peace and stability in Libya"", but affirmed ""the continuation of the efforts of the armed forces in their war against terrorist groups ... which control the capital Tripoli"".

A high-level source close to the LNA, who asked not to be identified, described the statement as a ""conditional acceptance"" of Russia and Turkey's call on Wednesday for a ceasefire to start on Jan. 12.

Haftar's forces began an offensive to take control of Tripoli in April that quickly stalled on the city's outskirts. However, the LNA has gained an advantage in recent weeks as fighting intensified and it seized the coastal city of Sirte on Monday.

Libya has been divided into rival camps based in Tripoli and the east since 2014, each with their own set of institutions.

Haftar's offensive upended a U.N.-led peace push and reignited a conflict that has in recent years fuelled migrant smuggling to Europe, given space to Islamist militants and disrupted oil supplies.

Both Russia and Turkey have been increasingly involved in Libya's conflict, with Turkey backing the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and the armed factions that support it. Turkey's parliament voted last week to allow a troop deployment to the North African country.

Russia has largely backed Haftar, whilst maintaining relations with the GNA.

In recent months Russian military contractors have deployed alongside the LNA, which has also received air support from the United Arab Emirates and backing from Jordan and Egypt, according to U.N. experts and diplomats.

The GNA has said it welcomes any serious call for a return to the political process.

""The GNA urgently wants to restore peace, and until that is possible ... we will exercise our lawful right to enter into military alliances and defend our country from attack,"" senior GNA adviser Mohammed Ali Abdallah said in a statement on Thursday.

11401534,2020-01-07,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Forces aligned with Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord said on Tuesday they had withdrawn from the strategic coastal city of Sirte to avoid bloodshed, after their eastern rivals rapidly entered it and took control.

Holding Sirte would be an important gain for eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, who since April has waged a military offensive on the capital, Tripoli, home to the GNA, to try to extend his control across the vast, mainly desert country.

Sirte is just west of important oil export terminals, also controlled by Haftar, and is strategically positioned on supply routes between eastern, western and southern Libya.

The advance of Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) comes as Turkey prepares to send military advisors and experts to Libya to help shore up the GNA, part of rising international involvement in Libya's conflict.

""Our forces took a decision, after studying the situation, to withdraw outside Sirte, then await orders,"" the Sirte Protection Force, a GNA ally, said in a statement.

""Our forces still retain their full capabilities and our withdrawal from Sire is not the end,"" it added.

The LNA said on Monday it had taken Sirte in a swift advance preceded by air strikes.

Sirte lies in the center of Libya's Mediterranean coast, and has been controlled by GNA-aligned forces since they ejected Islamic State from the city with the help of U.S. air strikes in late 2016.

The Sirte Protection Force said it had withdrawn ""to save the blood of civilians and the youth of the forces"" in Sirte, adding that the LNA got help from ""sleeper cells"" in the city of 120,000.

Many of the Sirte Protection Force were from Misrata, a city to the northwest that led the campaign against Islamic State and is a key source of military power for the GNA.

On Tuesday, an LNA military source said LNA forces clashed with Misratan forces in Abu Grain area, between Sirte an Misrata.

The Sirte Protection Force accused LNA fighters of burning homes and committing theft and looting in Sirte after entering the city on Monday. Forces loyal to Haftar denied any violations.

""These are neither our actions or the Libyan army's actions. On the contrary, we were received with cheers,"" an LNA spokesman told Reuters.

Since launching a bitter campaign for Benghazi, Libya's second city, in 2014, Haftar has gradually expanded his territorial control across the north African country.

Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said they had taken areas surrounding Sirte including al-Qardabiya air base, before moving towards the city center.

""The commander-in-chief decided on a well-planned,pre-emptive strike and within less than three hours we were in the heart of Sirte,"" said LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari.

""It was a sudden, swift operation,"" he said, adding that the advance had been preceded by several hours of air strikes.

An LNA military source said forces from the city of Misrata had retreated. Misrata led the campaign against Islamic State and is a key source of military power for the GNA.

Earlier, a resident in Sirte city center told Reuters by phone: ""We can see convoys of LNA inside Sirte city ... they control large parts of the city now. We also hear gunfire.""

There was no immediate comment from GNA forces.

The LNA advance comes as Turkey prepares to send military advisors and experts to Libya to help shore up the GNA, part of a trend of rising international involvement in Libya's conflict.

Haftar's LNA has received material and military support from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt, according U.N. experts and diplomats.

In recent weeks there has been an escalation of fighting, shelling and air strikes around Tripoli. On Saturday evening a military college in the capital was hit, killing at least 30 people, a day after the only functioning airport in Tripoli faced its latest closure due to shelling and rocket fire.

Sirte, the birthplace of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, was taken over by Islamic State in early 2015, becoming the jihadist group's most important base outside the Middle East.

Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord asked for Turkish support last month as it fends off an offensive by forces led by eastern leader Khalifa Haftar, backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkish military units had started moving to Libya to support the GNA. Asked to elaborate on Erdogan's comments, Cavusoglu said Turkey would send experts, advisers and technical teams under a military cooperation agreement signed with the GNA in November.

A bill passed by Turkey's parliament last week also allowed for the deployment of troops.

""How and when this will happen is to be decided by the government, under the president's leadership,"" Cavusoglu said.

On Sunday, Saudi Arabia condemned the ""recent Turkish escalation in Libya"" and the parliamentary approval for troop deployment, calling it a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The United Nations has imposed an arms embargo on both sides of Libya's conflict, which it says several countries have breached.

Cavusoglu's comments come a week after Turkish officials said that Ankara was considering sending Syrian rebel fighters to Libya as part of its planned military support.

Ankara has backed rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the almost nine-year civil war, and Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters spearheaded a Turkish military offensive in northern Syria in October.

A spokesman for the FSA denied that Ankara had requested that it send fighters to Libya, but a military source within the FSA said some fighters had signed up on an individual basis to work as ""bodyguards"" for a Turkish security company in Libya.

Flights were suspended at Tripoli's only functioning airport on Friday due to rocket fire and shelling, and at least 30 people were killed in an attack on a military academy in Tripoli on Saturday.

The U.S. Embassy in Libya said the violence ""underscores the dangers of toxic foreign interference in Libya, such as the arrival of Syrian fighters supported by Turkey as well as the deployment of Russian mercenaries.""

Cavusoglu denied that any FSA fighters had been deployed to Libya and said Turkey was against the deployment of mercenaries in Libya, referring to Russian and Sudanese fighters.

Libya has lacked stable central rule since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011 by rebel fighters with air support from NATO.

The residents said they heard loud blasts and then saw black smoke rising from the area around the hospital during a day of heavy mutual bombardment by Libya's warring sides.

The local council of Abu Salim district said the hospital had been targeted by rockets fired by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar, which has been attempting to capture Tripoli for a year.

Abu Salim council posted photographs showing damaged cars in the hospital grounds and said five people had been injured in the attack. A local aid group said six of the hospital's patients had been evacuated.

In chaos and without central authority since the 2011, Western-backed uprising that ousted strongman Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is poorly placed to withstand any epidemic.

The United Nations has urged warring parties to stop fighting so the overstretched health system can prepare. Cycles of conflict have destroyed much of Libya's infrastructure and a financial crisis has stopped salaries to many medics.

Sisi and Trump spoke by telephone as Egypt's parliament went into a closed session, the assembly's speaker, Ali Abdelaal, told reporters but gave few details.

Egyptian media said lawmakers would discuss Libya and that they might give Sisi a mandate to intervene in the conflict.

Sisi said last week Egypt would not stand idle in the face of what he called threats to Egyptian and Libyan security, and that any intervention in Libya would require the approval of parliament, which is dominated by his supporters.

Egypt is concerned about instability in Libya and Turkey's support for the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, whose fighters have moved closer to the central city of Sirte in the hope of recapturing it from the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar.

Sirte is the gateway to oil exporting ports which are held by the LNA and Sisi last month declared the Sirte frontline a red line for Egypt, which supports Haftar alongside the United Arab Emirates and Russia.

Turkish support for the internationally recognised government's forces has contributed to the LNA abandoning its 14-month offensive on Tripoli, a setback for Haftar's plan to unify Libya by force.

A big escalation in Libya could risk igniting a direct conflict among the foreign powers that have poured in weapons and fighters in violation of an arms embargo.

Earlier on Wednesday, the French defence ministry official accused the Turkish navy of harassing a French warship on a NATO mission.

He said the French ship had wanted to check whether the Turkish vessel Cirkin was smuggling arms to Libya. In response, French officials said the Cirkin had switched off its tracking system, masked its ID number, and refused to say where it was going.

The Turkish military official told Reuters the French warship did not establish communications with the Turkish ship during the incident.

""If one takes into account that the French warship was refuelled by our side before the alleged incident, it is clear how inappropriate and intentional the allegation is,"" he said.

The UAE statement did not comment directly on Haftar's declaration on Monday that his army would take power, ripping up a 2015 political agreement that has been the basis for all international peacemaking efforts.

The UAE ""commends the Libyan National Army for conducting anti-terror operations,"" a statement by the Emirati Foreign Ministry said, expressing ""its categorical rejection of the Turkish military intervention"" in support of the rival, Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).

The statement expressed the UAE's support for a political solution based on the Berlin conference, calling on ""all parties to commit to the political process under the supervision of the United Nations.""

Responding to the UAE's statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hami Aksoy said the remarks were an attempt by the UAE to ""hide their two-faced politics"" and said it was providing aid to ""putschists"" in Libya.

Turkey backs the GNA, Libya's internationally recognised government, and has signed a military cooperation agreement to help it repel an Haftar's offensive. Ankara has repeatedly urged world powers to stop supporting Haftar's forces, which it deems ""putschists.""

11401990,2020-01-22,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said France was determined Iran would never gain a nuclear weapon but it wanted to avoid any military escalation in the Middle East, after he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday.

Macron's two-day trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories is timed to coincide with the 75-year anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.

He is one of dozens of world leaders due to attend Thursday's World Holocaust Forum at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem.

Macron started his visit with a morning meeting with Netanyahu at his official residence in Jerusalem, where the two discussed Iran's nuclear program and regional security issues from Libya to Turkey, according to Netanyahu's office.

""In the current context, France is determined that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, but also that we avoid all military escalations in the region,"" Macron said afterwards.

Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader urged Macron to put pressure on Iran over what he called its aggression in the region.

France, along with Britain and Germany, declared Iran in violation of the 2015 nuclear pact last week and they launched a dispute mechanism that could see the matter referred back to the Security Council and the reimposition of U.N. sanctions.

The nuclear dispute has been at the heart of an escalation between Washington and Tehran which blew up into military confrontation in recent weeks.

Macron is also due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday afternoon in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank at a time when peace prospects between Israelis and Palestinians look dim.

The Palestinians are boycotting a peace initiative by U.S. President Donald Trump, and Netanyahu has repeated pledges to annex Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank.

France believes a two-state solution is the only viable option to end the conflict but Macron has ruled out recognizing an independent Palestinian state, saying it would not serve peace efforts.

Macron last week played down any real prospect of renewing French efforts to push the peace process, stalled since 2014, saying it was not for him to dictate to either side.

At a campaign rally for his right-wing Likud party on Tuesday, Netanyahu, who is seeking re-election, renewed a promise to ""impose Israeli sovereignty on the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea"" and annex all Israeli settlements.

Macron also on Wednesday made a symbolic stop at one of France's territories in the Holy Land - the Church of St. Anne, where the French tricolor has flown since the Ottomans gave it to Emperor Napoleon III in 1856 as thanks for his support in the Crimean War. It remains in French hands to this day through international treaties.

Before heading to the church, he walked through the Old City, speaking to shopkeepers and stopping by the Church of the Holy Sepulcre.

""Be it schools, hospitals, orphanages, or religious sites like this, we continue to defend French identity,"" a French diplomatic source said.

""We are a step away here from Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall, the very heart of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, so symbolically we are.""

A squabble broke out between Israeli police and French security officers when Israeli officers tried to enter St. Anne ahead of Macron's visit. They were rebuffed by French officials who told them it was French property and a shouting match ensued.

11401994,2020-01-07,"CAIRO (Reuters) - The planned arrival of Turkish military advisers in Libya should bolster the internationally recognized government, but may not be enough to turn the tide of a conflict in which eastern-based forces have the upper hand thanks to foreign support.

Turkey's decision to send the advisers and technical experts responded to a request by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA), which Ankara backs against forces allied to veteran commander Khalifa Haftar.

Turkey has already provided drones and armored vehicles for the defense of the capital, Tripoli, which helped quickly stall the offensive launched by Haftar's forces nine months ago.

But Turkish backing has often been outweighed by air power from the United Arab Emirates in support of Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), and by a technological and frontline edge provided by Russian military contractors since September, officials, diplomats and analysts say.

""The decision by the GNA to request military support from Turkey follows a dangerous escalation in the conflict from Haftar and his backers, including bringing in Russian mercenaries,"" GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha said in a statement to Reuters.

On Monday, the LNA advanced into Sirte, a strategic city in the center of Libya's Mediterranean coastline, and fighting has increased around Tripoli in recent weeks.

This has heightened pressure on GNA forces, which two sources close to those forces said had been struggling against missile systems being used to bring down drones and laser-guided shells thought to have been introduced by Russian contractors.

The GNA's drone fleet has also been depleted by attacks on airports and air bases in Tripoli and the city of Misrata, northwest of Sirte.

Turkish officials have indicated that any deployment will not involve troops but that Turkey has been considering sending Syrian rebels. A source in the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army said some fighters had already signed up as guards.

""What this will bring above all is a rebalancing of forces,"" said Arnaud Delalande, an independent defense consultant and Libya expert. ""In particular it could bring air defense, which could be jamming systems, but also coordination of troops on the ground.""

Maneuvering in Libya by Russia and Turkey, whose presidents meet in Turkey on Wednesday, has overshadowed European efforts to revive a U.N.-led peace process.

Although Turkey and Russia have generally been on opposing sides in Syria's civil war, they have strengthened economic and military ties recently. They now cooperate in northeast Syria, where they mount joint patrols, and Ankara bought Russian missile defense systems last year despite opposition in Washington.

Ankara and Moscow want to protect their strategic interests in Libya, where they lost lucrative contracts in 2011 after a NATO-backed uprising, and in the wider east Mediterranean region. [L8N28R455]

The two countries are unlikely to clash directly, with Ankara seeking leverage to negotiate over offshore gas drilling rights after signing military and maritime accords with the GNA in November.

""In Libya, Ankara's end game is not to help Tripoli win the conflict, which is not realistic. It is to create a stalemate and political negotiations that preserve its maritime demarcation deal,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who heads the Istanbul-based Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies think tank.

A senior Turkish official told Reuters: ""Turkey is in close contact with Russia to prevent conflict. This will continue.""

Russia could be eyeing a long-term goal of having a naval base in eastern Libya, said Jalel Harchaoui, a research fellow with the Clingendael Institute think tank in The Hague.

""Russia is presented with a golden opportunity to make its presence in eastern Libya more entrenched,"" he said.

Ankara and Moscow are filling a gap left by U.S. disengagement in Libya under President Donald Trump and there are divisions among European states over Libya.

""I think the Europeans are completely left out in the cold here,"" said Harchaoui.

11401996,2020-01-07,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top diplomat and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy condemned on Tuesday Turkey's plans to send military experts and trainers to Libya, saying foreign interference there was exacerbating instability.

After postponing a trip to Tripoli over safety concerns, the ministers and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell held talks in Brussels to call for a ceasefire as Libya's internationally recognized government struggled to fend off a military offensive on its power base in the capital.

""Continuing outside interference is fuelling the crisis,"" the ministers and Borrell said in their joint statement released after the meeting.

In remarks to reporters, Borrell said: ""It is obvious that this made a reference to the Turkish decision to intervene with their troops in Libya, which is something that we reject.""

Turkey will send military experts and technical teams to support Libya's internationally recognized government, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday, a day after President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkish military units were moving to Tripoli.

Turkey is nominally a candidate to join the EU, though accession talks have long stalled due to disagreements over human rights, Cyprus and other issues.

The EU talks were to have taken place in Libya but the Tripoli government asked for them to be postponed, according to two EU diplomats.

Europe and the United States face being sidelined in Libya by Turkey and Russia, which are taking a bigger role in the conflict there. Libya has been in turmoil since veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi's fall due to an uprising in 2011.

Turkey supports the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), while Russia backs eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces hold much of the country's east and south including its second city Benghazi. They are making a renewed attempt to take Tripoli.

""There is a proxy war under way. All interferences have to stop. There are countries that interfere with a civil war, turning it into a proxy war,"" Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told reporters in Brussels before traveling to Turkey to meet his Turkish counterpart Cavusoglu.

The EU had hoped to send a diplomatic mission to Libya to train Libyan officials and build up institutions in support of the GNA, but that has been deemed too dangerous for now, diplomats said.

11402062,2020-05-18,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Senior members of the Swiss legislature are demanding a parliamentary investigation into a spying operation in which U.S. and German intelligence used a Swiss cryptography company as a front to eavesdrop on other countries.

The government has appointed a former Supreme Court justice to look into ""Operation Rubicon"", which for decades involved the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and German BND spy service covertly using Crypto AG's encryption technology to crack other nations' top-secret messages.

He is due to report back by the end of June and the cabinet will be briefed.

But pressure is mounting for parliament to launch its own investigation to find out who in Switzerland knew about the scheme.

Although the outlines of ""Operation Rubicon"" were known for years, new details about its scope and duration were made public this week by Swiss, German and U.S. investigative journalists.

If the Swiss state knew of the operation and turned a blind eye to it, Switzerland's image as a neutral go-between in international affairs could be damaged.

Alfred Heer, head of parliament's government oversight committee, told broadcaster SRF he would propose his panel look into the matter.

""This is the fastest way to shed light on the affair,"" he said. ""It is our obligation to investigate this case.""

The center-left Social Democrats have called for a full parliamentary investigation and two other coalition parties said they were also open to a full investigation, which would be only the fifth in Swiss history.

The company used its base in neutral Switzerland to help it sell code-making equipment to Iran, India, Pakistan, Libya, Egypt, Chile, Argentina and dozens of other countries who in effect paid millions of dollars to be spied on.

The technology was modified to let the CIA and BND break codes, the Washington Post newspaper and German and Swiss broadcasters ZDF and SRF reported. They described U.S. spymasters and their then-West German counterparts as controlling nearly all Crypto operations from 1970.

Several former government officials approached by SRF denied knowledge of the operation or said they did not remember.

SRF cited unnamed sources as saying Swiss intelligence knew of the scheme and that Swiss officials helped block a police investigation in the 1990s after a Crypto executive tipped off authorities.",Reuters,energy,,"['Switzerland', 'Zürich', 'United States', 'Germany', 'Pakistan', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'India', 'Egypt', 'Chile', 'Argentina']",Pressure mounts for Swiss parliamentary probe into spying operation,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-cyber-idUSKBN2071F3,None,
11402063,2020-05-08,"CAIRO (Reuters) - After several failed crossings from Libya to Italy and a long spell in detention, Nigerian migrant Olu had pinned his hopes on being evacuated from the besieged city of Tripoli with his family.

Instead, with refugee resettlement disrupted and air space closed against the new coronavirus, he found himself stranded in the Libyan capital as the war intensified, unable to work because of restrictions linked to the pandemic.

So far, there are no reports of the virus spreading among migrants in Libya. But there are fears it could have a devastating impact if it takes hold.

Libya has an estimated 654,000 migrants - more than 48,000 of them registered asylum seekers or refugees - many of them living in cramped conditions with little access to healthcare.

Restrictions on movement are driving them further into hardship.

""For the past two months I have not been able to work,"" said Olu, 38, who has been living in a single room in Tripoli with his wife and five children since his release from a migrant detention centre in February.

He has cobbled together enough money for rent and food with transfers from friends and a cash handout from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. But casual labour is still hard to find after a 24-hour curfew was relaxed late last month, and he is worried those funds will run out.

""If I lose this apartment I'd be out on the street and I'd be exposed to this deadly virus,"" he said by phone from Tripoli. ""So it's very scary now."" He declined to give his family name for security reasons.

African and Middle Eastern migrants have long come to Libya seeking jobs in the country's oil-powered economy.

As the country slid into conflict after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011, smugglers put hundreds of thousands of them in boats and sent them off across the Mediterranean towards Italy.

But in the past three years, crossings dropped sharply due to EU and Italian-backed efforts to disrupt smuggling networks and to increase interceptions by Libya's coastguard, a move condemned by human rights groups.

Those intercepted by the coast guard are detained in centres nominally under control of the government, or left to fend for themselves.

Migrant detention centres have been repeatedly hit in the fighting. Late on Thursday a volley of rockets landed on the Tripoli seafront, near a naval base where returned migrants disembark.

About 25 migrants had to return to a coast guard vessel to avoid the shelling, before being disembarked and taken to a detention centre that is not under government control, the International Organization for Migration said.

One Eritrean migrant in detention in Zawiya, west of Tripoli, said he was sleeping in a hangar with about 230 people, including some suspected to have tuberculosis. Those who could not afford to bribe guards were kept in a separate, permanently locked hangar, he said.

""We don't have enough food. We have 24 TB patients. We don't have any precautions against coronavirus,"" he said in a text message.

Aid agencies that struggle to operate in a country dominated by armed groups are finding it harder to trace returned migrants after they disembark.

""It seems like there are fewer people in detention,"" said Tom Garofalo, Libya country director for the International Rescue Committee. ""But the question is where are they going, and we don't know the answer to that, so that's very distressing.""

UNHCR had been evacuating or resettling some of the most vulnerable refugees until airspace was shut in early April.

The agency, which had to close a transit centre in Tripoli in January due to interference by armed groups, is now handing out cash, food and hygiene kits. But payments are hampered by a long-running liquidity crisis at Libya's banks, said UNHCR's Libya mission head, Jean-Paul Cavalieri.

He worries that with the loss of livelihoods due to coronavirus, more will attempt sea crossings.

""People are getting desperate,"" he said. ""We are concerned that some of them will ... put their lives at risk on the sea.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Cairo', 'Nigeria', 'Italy', 'Zawiya, Libya', 'Eritrea']",Coronavirus narrows options for migrants buffeted by Libya's war,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-libya-migrants-idUSKBN22K1MP,None,
11402064,2020-05-07,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The novel coronavirus could kill between 83,000 and 190,000 people in Africa in the first year and infect between 29 million and 44 million in the first year if it is not contained, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.

The projections are contained in a new WHO Africa study based on assumptions that no containment measures are put in place, which has fortunately not been the case, WHO Africa head Matshidiso Moeti told reporters in a teleconference.

Most countries on the continent have imposed restrictions on public gatherings, international travel and curfews among other measures meant to curb the spread of the virus.

The virus hit Africa later than other continents and transmission rates are lower than elsewhere. Still, this could translate into a prolonged, years-long outbreak, WHO said.

""COVID-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat,"" Moeti said in a separate statement.

The organisation warned that small countries, as well as Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon, could be severely affected.

Notably, the WHO Africa study covered only the 47 countries that belong to the WHO Africa region and not the entire continent. The body's regional definition excludes Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco.

11402065,2020-03-01,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The Swiss government has filed a criminal complaint over the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's alleged use of a cryptography company as a front to spy on various governments' secret communications, the Swiss attorney general's office said on Sunday.

The complaint against persons unknown for alleged breaches of the law governing export controls follows recent reports on ""Operation Rubicon"", which for decades involved the CIA and German BND spy services covertly reading other nations' secret messages encoded with technology sold by Swiss firm Crypto AG.

The case of Crypto, which sold encryption devices and software while being secretly owned by U.S. and German intelligence services that could freely read what it encrypted, is embarrassing for neutral Switzerland and could hurt its international reputation, particularly if it turned a blind eye.

Although the outlines of Operation Rubicon were known for years, new details about its scope and duration were made public last month by Swiss, German and U.S. investigative journalists.

""The Office of the Attorney General confirms it has received a criminal complaint by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) dated Feb. 2, 2020 regarding possible violations of export control law,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement. SECO is part of the Swiss Economy Ministry.

The attorney general's office will review the complaint before deciding whether to open criminal proceedings, the statement said, confirming a report by newspaper SonntagsZeitung.

A spokeswoman for Switzerland's Economy Ministry confirmed that the complaint had been filed but declined to elaborate.

The technology Crypto sold to dozens of governments including those of Iran, India, Pakistan, Libya, Egypt, Chile, and Argentina had deliberate flaws or built-in back doors that made messages easily readable to U.S. and German spies. In effect, those client countries paid millions to be spied on.

SonntagsZeitung said SECO, which is in charge of authorizing exports of sensitive equipment, believes it was deceived into clearing the sale of Crypto's machines and software, and argues it would never have done so had it known of the scheme.

The Swiss government has appointed a former Swiss Supreme Court justice to look into Operation Rubicon. He is due to report back by the end of June and the cabinet will be briefed.

But pressure is mounting for parliament to launch its own investigation to find out who in Switzerland knew about the scheme.",Reuters,energy,,"['Switzerland', 'Vienna', 'United States', 'Germany', 'Pakistan', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'India', 'Egypt', 'Chile', 'Argentina']",Switzerland files criminal complaint over Crypto spying scandal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-spying-crypto-idUSKBN20O1VD,None,
11402066,2020-02-24,"LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Shareholders of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be asked in May whether to give the bank the green light for expansion into sub-Saharan Africa, the bank's president told Reuters.

Set up in 1991 to help ex-communist countries of eastern Europe shift to market economies, the bank is also interested in expanding into Algeria should the new government request to join the institution.

Majority owned by G7 top economic powers, the EBRD has widened its geographic scope in recent years to 37 countries including Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco in Africa.

The London-based development bank has in recent years harboured ambitions to expand its footprint into sub-Saharan Africa, but faced resistance from some of its top shareholders.

""As a management we think there's a case for limited and incremental expansion into sub-Saharan Africa and we be will putting that case to our shareholders,"" President Suma Chakrabarti told Reuters. ""We have not decided on countries. We have been looking at types of countries as the first thing to decide is if there's a case for expansion.""

Chakrabarti's term as president comes to an end in July after the 69 shareholder countries, that include the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan, in May vote on the EBRD's strategy for the period 2021-25 and a new president.

The bank, which invested a record 10 billion euros across its regions in 2019 and aimed to invest a similar amount in 2020, had sufficient capital of 30 billion euros to fund any expansion plans, he said.

EBRD could play a part in helping Algeria, including reducing the role of the state in the economy and diversifying it away from a reliance on oil and gas revenues, he said.

Protests have rocked Algeria since last year and forced veteran Abdelaziz Bouteflika to resign as president in April, with his replacement Abdelmadjid Tebboune elected in December in a vote largely rejected by protesters.

""Algeria needs to send an application letter,"" said Chakrabarti. ""Lets see if the new government wants to engage with the international sector.""

Along with Libya, Algeria is one of the few corners of the Arab world where the bank has not expanded operations in the wake of a spate of civil unrest starting in 2011.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, EBRD is also providing funding in Lebanon, grappling with a severe economic and financial crisis that is choking off foreign currency supplies needed to pay for imports.

Since starting operations in Lebanon two years ago, the EBRD has signed six trade credit programme arrangements with six local banks to provide $220 million to help fund the import of key commodities.

""The new government will have to look at serious fiscal and structural reforms and there's serious economic change that they have to address,"" he said.

11402068,2020-02-11,"BRUSSELS/ROME (Reuters) - Italy is prepared to consider a resumption of maritime patrols in the Mediterranean, a senior official said, but diplomats said Austria is sticking to its objections, in a blow to European efforts to uphold a U.N. arms embargo on Libya.

The EU's military mission Operation Sophia stopped deploying ships last March after Italy, facing an anti-immigrant backlash, said it would no longer receive those rescued at sea.

Italy is ready to restart the sea patrols, the country's vice foreign minister told Reuters, but diplomats said Austria was still blocking the move, based on its position that people rescued on the high seas should not be taken to Europe.

Italy also insists the mission not focus on rescues while accepting the principle of renewed sea patrols, following a summit of world leaders last month in Berlin to seek a ceasefire among Libya's two rival governments.

""The reactivation of Operation (Sophia) is possible but with a profoundly revised mandate and a focus on the arms embargo in Libya,"" Italy's vice foreign minister Emanuela Del Re told Reuters on Tuesday.

However, diplomats said that despite weeks of negotiations, Austria's conservative government has retained its objections. The EU needs the support of all 27 member countries to restart the maritime patrols.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz says Austria is a ""target country"" for migrants seeking a better life in Europe, similarly to Germany and Sweden and is opposed to the maritime patrols, arguing that rescuing people encourages more to come.

Diplomats said Vienna had rejected a compromise for the mission to resume in phases, starting with air surveillance over the sea, then moving into all Libyan airspace and then with a final phase using all available EU assets on air, land and sea.

At a news conference with his German counterpart Angela Merkel last week, Kurz said enforcing the U.N. embargo was ""possible from the air"". However, EU military commanders who briefed EU diplomats this month warned that anti-aircraft systems in Libya made such overflights increasingly risky.

The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell, who has warned the bloc it may become irrelevant if it cannot act more assertively, hoped to reach a deal to revive the maritime patrols on Feb. 17 at a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels.

Borrell noted in a speech to the European Parliament on Monday that Austria has ""major concerns"" about reviving a mission that many EU governments said had been effective in dissuading smugglers when first launched in June 2015.

Borrell told Italy's La Repubblica newspaper that a compromise was sea patrols away from the central Mediterranean and migrant routes, ""further to the east toward Benghazi, or even by the Suez canal. The arms come from the east.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'Italy', 'Austria', 'Rome', 'Berlin', 'Brussels', 'Germany', 'Vienna', 'Sweden', 'Benghazi']","Austria blocking EU Libya sea patrols over migrants, diplomats say",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-eu-idUSKBN2052HL,None,
11402177,2020-10-28,"The Libyan ceasefire agreement, which is being painted as a permanent one, could soon face increased opposition if third party interference is not dealt with. The UN-brokered (UNSMIL) agreement has been hailed by the 5+5 Joint Military Commission members and the Tripoli-based government as a major step forward. At the same time, Libyan general Haftar, leader of the Libyan National Army in the eastern part of the country, has been strangely quiet on the deal. His backers, mainly Russia, the UAE and Egypt, have been generally supportive of the agreement but have warned that there is still more to be done. Global oil markets are already preparing for a possible wave of Libyan oil in the coming months, with production being projected to hit 1 million bpd. Libya's national oil company NOC has now lifted the force majeure on all its production fields and export terminals. While all of this is positive news for Libya, the country's reentry into global oil and gas markets will depend upon the ability of the two main warring parties to bring a decade-long civil war to an end. The ultimate goal of the UN-led efforts for peace is a unified governance framework, with political discussions taking place on October 26 and face-to-face meetings in Tunisia from November 9 onwards. Both parties, the LNA and the GNA, are eager to boost oil exports as the extra revenue is badly needed, but that is no guarantee of peace. The recent announcement that the leader of the GNA-led Tripoli-government, Al Sarraj, will step down by the end of October does little to ensure onlooker about the party's stability. At the same time, Libyan general Haftar is far from secure as the leader of the LNA. There are growing indications that the disastrous LNA military operations in the west, resulting in a military stalemate, have undermined his position severely.

The certainty of Libya's oil future depends upon the stability of the government. While there are some promising signs at the moment, the ongoing interference from third parties such as Turkey, Iran, Russia and the UAE could threaten that stability. Without the consent and support of these external parties, it is unlikely that a long-term ceasefire will be realized.

Just after the ceasefire agreement, Erdogan made a veiled threat of continued fighting. Ankara seems to be unhappy with one specific article in the agreement that includes the expulsion of all mercenaries from the country, a move that is designed to end Russian and Turkish influence in Libya. The Turkish president has claimed that the agreement lacks credibility. While leaving a mosque in Istanbul after Friday prayers, Erdogan said that the deal had been made by two delegates, one representing Khalifa Haftar, Commander-in-Chief of the Libyan National Army (LNA), and the other a military commander from Misrata representing the Government of National Accord (GNA) headed by Fayez Al Sarraj. As the deal wasn't made by the highest figures in each party, Erdogan stated that ""we do not know the validity of (the decision) to withdraw mercenaries from there within three months."" Turkey's apparent willingness to remain on the battlefield is a clear sign that the current ceasefire is far from a certainty. Some Libyan sources were quoted as saying that fighting should resume after Defence Minister Salah al-Din Al Nimroush pushed military reinforcements to a number of cities in the western region. Several military maneuvers by the GNA have also been reported around Sirte in recent weeks. Turkey appears to be supporting the hardliners within the GNA, as represented by Minister of Interior Fathi Bashagha, who is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. Bashagha is yet to openly support the Geneva ceasefire.

At the same time, President Erdogan added to uncertainty by indicating that Turkey's military deals with Libya's GNA will not be altered. Libyan Defense Minister Salaheddin Al Namroush confirmed that statement, saying that ""the signing of the initial agreement does not include the military cooperation agreement with the state of Turkey, an ally of the legitimate government."" He reiterated that Turkish training is needed to counter possible LNA military operations. UNSMIL head Stephanie Turco Williams said, however, that an article of the agreement states that military training activities that are being held under military agreements would be halted and training teams would leave the country until a new unity government takes over. At the same time, a video published by the GNA's ""Volcano of Rage"" operation's room showed Libyan forces carrying out military exercises in Turkey. The blatant disregard for that article by Turkey suggests the agreement is already on shaky ground.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Tunisia', 'Egypt', 'Geneva', 'Misrata', 'Sirte', 'Istanbul', 'Ankara', 'Iran']",Why Libya's Surge In Oil Exports Won't Last | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Why-Libyas-Surge-In-Oil-Exports-Wont-Last.html,None,

""As NOC highly commends the efforts exerted by all local and international parties, it undertakes to hold to the non-political professional principles, continues in performing its responsibilities and duties in a completely neutral manner and declares that as production resumes from Waha and Harouge fields, production level will reach 800 thousand bbl./day during two weeks and will exceed one million barrels in four weeks,"" NOC said in a statement.

NOC first announced it would lift the force majeure imposed earlier this year from two oil ports after the Libyan National Army of General Halifa Khaftar agreed to lift a blockade of the oil-exporting infrastructure that started in January this year.

Within a month, the country's oil production had recovered from below 100,000 bpd to over 500,000 bpd, not least thanks to the restart of production at the Sharara field, Libya's largest, with a capacity of 300,000 bpd.

A month ago, expectations were that the return of a full 1 million bpd supply from Libya was not imminent and would likely take months. However, the National Oil Corporation appears bent on ramping up production as quickly as possible, which is understandable with the less than stellar track record of various militarized factions in upholding ceasefires.

This would mean more pressure for oil prices: the North African OPEC member was exempted from the OPEC+ cuts, and this means it could expand production however much it wants to and add supply to an extra-sensitive market.

On the plus side, from OPEC's point of view, NOC also warned a production level of 1 million bpd would be unsustainable unless Libya's government provides the company with enough funds to pay off debts accumulated during the oil port blockade. NOC also said it would be unable to push production back to pre-blockade levels of 1.2 million bpd.",OilPrice.com,energy,,['Libya'],Oil Prices Fall As Libya Looks To Bring Back 1 Million Bpd | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Prices-Fall-As-Libya-Looks-To-Bring-Back-1-Million-Bpd.html,None,
11402179,2020-09-21,"Market sentiment has been generally bullish over the last week supported by (i) supply disruption caused by Hurricane Sally in the Gulf of Mexico (ii) a draw in commercial crude oil inventories by 4.4 million barrels w/w and (iii) strong language coming from OPEC+ during the JMMC meeting last Thursday, during which Saudi Arabia pressured members to boost compliance to output cuts.

The supply disruption in the Gulf of Mexico reached around 497 thousand bbl/d. Yet, it is reported that supply will soon return as the hurricane has passed the oil production area while being downgraded from category 2 to a tropical storm. Next to the production outages, fuel demand in the affected areas is likely to have been disrupted, at least for a couple of days. Gulf of Mexico drillers, however, are already preparing for a new storm as Beta is approaching fast, potentially leading to another supply outage in the Gulf.

Renewed assurance from OPEC+

The OPEC+ JMMC meeting last week resulted in an extension for compensation cuts until the end of December, as many countries asked for more time to make the required output cuts. Despite the fact that Iraq has been fully compliant in August, it has not delivered its missed targets in the previous months yet. Furthermore, the UAE, Russia and Nigeria have achieved compliance rates of 74%, 95%, and 78%, respectively, according to Platts.

The overall conformity level in August was 101% according to OPEC secondary sources. Overproduction amounted to 1.641 million bbl/d, from the OPEC-10 countries and 0.734 million bbl/d from the non-OPEC countries leading to a total of 2.375 million bbl/d in overproduction between May-August. OPEC didn't decide to change the output cut pact at this meeting. The current agreement includes cuts of 7.7 million bbl/d, Between Aug-Dec, down from 9.7 million bbl/d, between May-July.

The group is scheduled to relax its cuts further to 5.8 million bbl/d starting from Jan 2021. Currently global demand is slowly recovering, with strong Chinese imports leading the way. Global demand levels in August are around 6 million bbl/d below 2019. Chinese refining runs rose to 14 million bbl/d, up by 9.2% y/y, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, despite weak refining margins. Yet, high oil inventories in China and shrinking crack spreads are leading to softer imports in September.

Libya to restart crude exports

The market is bracing for extra supply from Libya as LNA General Haftar announced the lifting of an oil export blockade that lasted for about eight months. The blockade cut Libyan oil supply from 1.1 million bbl/d, in 2019, to less than 0.10 million bbl/d in 2020. The National Oil Company confirmed that it will start production from fields that are free of Russian mercenaries and other militants. The distribution of revenues and fears of supporting armed militias resulted in a $9.8 billion loss, blackouts and fuel shortages in the country.

The first exported cargoes are expected to come from the Arabian Gulf Oil Company which produces around 0.29 million bbl/d which is predominantly exported through the Hariga port on the east coast. Production is not expected to reach capacity anytime soon as the country's oil industry suffers from major infrastructure issues. The OPEC+ agreement excludes three OPEC member countries; Iran, Libya and Venezuela, which leaves Libya with no restrictions on its production. Market reaction will depend on the strength of the economic recovery which may absorb extra supplies.

OPEC and IEA slash their demand forecast

The IEA and OPEC have slashed their demand forecast in 2020, projecting a decline by 8.4 million bbl/d and 9.5 million bbl/d respectively. OPEC and the IEA expect oil demand to average 90.2 million bbl/d and 91.7 million bbl/d, respectively, while our forecast stands at 90.35 million bbl/d. The EIA reported a decline in commercial crude oil inventories by 4.4 million barrels to stand at 496 million barrels. Domestic US production rose by 0.9 million bbl/ and now stands at 10.9 million bbl/d supported by a return of production in the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. oil demand now stands at 15.90 million bbl/d, up by 0.64 million bbl/d w/w.

In the meantime, demand continues to recovers in most key crude markets. Citi bank reported its forecast last week, and sees $60 price for Brent in 2021, assuming a full return to pre-crisis demand levels by the end of 2021. Yet, our latest forecast predicts a price of $45 by the end of December, $5 less than our previous forecast. Furthermore, our forecast for next year estimates an average price of $50 in H1 2021 and $52.5 in the H2 2021, assuming a partial return of aviation fuel demand leading to an average demand of 95 million bbl/d in 2021.

Protests that are engulfing Tobruk in eastern Libya -- Haftar's stronghold -- may not be what they seem. This week has seen the resignation of the eastern interim government of Abdullah al-Thani. That resignation will make it impossible for Speaker of Parliament Aguila Saleh to agree to any sort of a peace deal with the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.

Also take note that the protests--particularly intense in the eastern city of Benghazi--have a very specific emphasis: Corruption. And protesters are conveniently calling on the military (read: Haftar) to sort out that corruption -- hence al-Thani's resignation. In other words, al-Thani is linked to Saleh, and Haftar wants them out of the way, which opens the door for the military to assume full control in Benghazi.

Saleh has been a thorn in Haftar's side since he began jockeying for power by trying to push for a peace deal with the GNA that would sideline Haftar. Saleh mistakenly thought that because growing ranks of Western officialdom were calling for a ceasefire and peace agreement that he would be able to win this game.

11402182,2020-08-19,"Introduction The success of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) in forcing the withdrawal of the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) from northwestern Libya has led to a temporary détente in the conflict. As GNA officials contemplate an assault on the strategic city of Sirte, divisions have resurfaced between Tripoli's numerous militias. These divisions indicate the significant internal difficulties the GNA will likely face, regardless of further military success.

Tripoli's Militias

Since its creation in 2015, the GNA has relied heavily on myriad militia groups. These groups not only provide security in GNA territory, they also make up the majority of its fighting force against the LNA. In return, militia groups have gained access to state institutions and increased funding, which has bolstered their influence and power.

Despite apparent alignment with the GNA, ideological orientations and loyalties vary among the militias. The inter-militia differences within the GNA have been exacerbated by the increasing presence of foreign militias -- notably the Syrian militants flown in by Turkey to strengthen military support in the conflict against the LNA.

Rivalries between domestic militia groups temporarily halted due to the existential threat posed by the LNA's 15-month assault on Tripoli. Since the LNA's withdrawal from Tripoli on June 4, however, signs of divisions have resurfaced. On July 8, GNA-funded militia groups clashed in the Janzur neighborhood of Tripoli. Ten militants were killed in these clashes, apparently over access to energy infrastructure. Further inter-militia clashes occurred on July 31 in the Ain Zara neighborhood of southern Tripoli following an argument over the purchase of fuel. The latter incident forced the GNA Ministry of the Interior to establish patrols in Ain Zara to maintain security.

The increased presence of foreign militants has also affected the inter-militia balance. The changing demographic caused by the influx of Syrian militants has provoked fears of a major divide in the GNA camp. Hundreds of Syrian militants were filmed holding up the Turkish flag and pictures of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Janzur in August. While no clashes have occurred between foreign and domestic militias, a Tripoli security source stated that tensions between the two groups have increased due to differences in ideology and allegiance.

The Battle for Sirte

With the frontline of the civil war solidified around Sirte in the center of Libya, GNA forces are now stretched over an expanse of 400 kilometers. Some of the more nominally GNA-aligned militias will be able to take advantage of the increased security vacuum to solidify control and power. Territorial encroachment and competition for assets are a major driver in inter-militia conflict, and clashes are likely to intensify over the coming months.

The resultant instability could also be intensified if an escalation occurs in the battle for control of Sirte. Due to its key strategic location, major GNA stakeholders, such as Turkey, will bolster the GNA's military capabilities ahead of any future battle to ensure victory. Rather than relying on domestic militias, Turkey and the GNA are likely to increase reinforcements from abroad. Both Turkey and the GNA prefer to resort to foreign militias because it reduces their dependency on domestic militias looking to benefit from a future political settlement.

However, the increased dependency on foreign militias will further destabilize security in GNA territory. Domestic militias are likely to become increasingly resentful as they are crowded out and replaced by their foreign counterparts. The more these militia groups fear they will not benefit from a country controlled by the GNA, the more they will be open to defection to the LNA or other actors. Even without defection, their decreased involvement in the conflict may lead some militias to focus their profit-making efforts elsewhere, whether through increasing control over state assets in GNA-controlled territory or through other criminal activities, such as movement taxes and kidnapping.

This potential instability makes it imperative for the GNA to establish control over or disarm its militias. While the United States has intensified calls for security sector reform and militia disarmament, the GNA has not shown a real willingness, let alone the capability, to carry out these reforms.

GNA Security Sector Reform

Security sector reform is also vital for the stability of the GNA in the long-term. Militia groups may have played a prominent role in the GNA's recent military successes, but their influence harms the GNA's political legitimacy. The GNA cannot showcase itself as a democratic, civilian-led, rule-of-law state while unaccountable militia groups wield significant and independent control. Until the GNA achieves a monopoly on the legal use of force by its various actors, it will struggle to establish itself as a legitimate political force.

The GNA will face significant difficulties if and when they decide to carry out the reforms. Incorporating militia groups into a coherent and unified security force while coercing other militia groups to disarm remains a massive task. Such an undertaking is unlikely to be viewed as an attractive option while negotiating an imminent and potentially crucial battle over Sirte.

Delaying reform until the GNA takes control of Sirte, however, would be equally problematic. Control over the city would give the GNA access to significant oil revenue, which could lead to a flurry of militia attempts to divert a percentage of the profits. Likewise, the increased delay in undertaking reform would allow militias further time to entrench control and extend power.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Sirte', 'Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Zadar', 'Janzur', 'Libya', 'United States']",Could The GNA Ever Successfully Control Libya's Oil? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Africa/Could-The-GNA-Ever-Successfully-Control-Libyas-Oil.html,None,
11402183,2020-07-10,"The United States and Libya are probing a suspected scheme in which eastern Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar is allegedly paying Nicolas Maduro's regime in Venezuela U.S. dollars in exchange for gold, The Wall Street Journal reported, quoting Western and Libyan security officials.

Libya's government, against which Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) and affiliated factions are fighting in the civil war, has been tracking the commander's private jet, which appears to have traveled to Venezuela's capital, Caracas.

According to the investigations reported by the Journal, the plane is suspected of loading gold in Venezuela, delivering cash in U.S. dollars to Maduro's regime, which is cut off from the international oil trade by strict U.S. sanctions.

The U.S. and the United Nations are assisting the Libyan government with tracking the movements of Haftar's private jet, the Journal's sources said.

Last month, David Schenker, Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. Department of State, said on a press briefing:

""I - we've been tracking those reports on Haftar's trip - alleged trip to Venezuela. The allegations are concerning.""

""Haftar has been concerned his accounts could be frozen if he comes under sanctions"" and would rather have gold, which is more difficult to track, a European security official told the Journal.

Haftar's LNA and affiliated factions occupied Libya's oil export terminals and oilfields in January, choking off Libyan oil exports and sending its production plunging to less than 100,000 bpd from 1.2 million before the blockade.

Apart from the alleged gold trade with Libyan commander Haftar, Venezuela is also cooperating with Iran in a gold-for-services scheme, according to U.S. officials.

U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said earlier this year that Maduro's regime is paying Iran in gold for help with Venezuela's crumbling oil industry.

11402184,2020-06-22,"Sirte is the gateway to Libya's massive oil facilities and is a vital stronghold for General Hafta

After pushing General Haftar from Tripoli and key surrounding areas, Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) thought it was game over for the general, but now it finds itself describing the latest Egyptian move on this venue a ""declaration of war."" As Haftar's allies are forced to respond after largely waiting things out on the sidelines, the battle for Libya is now entering the next phase of far-reaching geopolitical consequences.

Last week, diplomatic activity in Libya hit fever pitch with Turkish officials visiting Tripoli for talks with the GNA, Russia contacting Washington to step into the ring on Haftar's behalf, and France blasting Turkey for meddling in a NATO mission in the Mediterranean to stop arms from reaching Libya.

Then, on Saturday, Egypt really stepped up to the plate with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi warning that if any pro-GNA forces advanced on Sirte - another Haftar stronghold the GNA is trying to take - Egypt would find it necessary to respond militarily.

In a televised address, the Egyptian president said Sirte was a ""red line"" for Egypt, citing the need to protect its porous border as grounds for ""direct intervention"" in Libya.

""If the Libyan people asked us to intervene, it is a signal to the world that Egypt and Libya share ... common interests, security and stability,"" Sisi said on Saturday.

The GNA called this a ""declaration of war.""

""We strongly reject what was said by al-Sisi and consider it a continuation of the war on the Libyan people, interference in Libyan affairs and a dangerous threat to national security,"" said Mohammed Amari Zayed, a member of the GNA's presidential council.

""There can be no 'red line' within our borders. We reject any bid aimed at dividing the Libyan people or their territory... (and) we categorically reject any bid to impose guardianship on Libya,"" he added.

If you were to believe the Turkish media over the past two weeks, the pro-GNA forces (which include Turkish military and its Syrian mercenaries) have taken over Sirte from Haftar.

But that battle is still ongoing.

Sirte is about 280 miles east of Tripoli, and it is a key strategic city for Haftar, who is under attack but who has dug in and not withdrawn. Turkey is urging Haftar's forces to pull out of Sirte as the only move that could lead the GNA to agree to a ceasefire.

This isn't just a Haftar stronghold - it's the key to controlling Libyan oil.

Sirte is on the coast, and it is largely the gateway to the country's massive oil facilities. All the external forces in this battle are lining up now, around Sirte.

It was also off the coast of Sirte last week that the French attempted to uphold an arms embargo.

While a French navy vessel was inspecting a vessel cargo suspected of containing embargoed arms to Libya, Turkish frigates targeted them with radar, suggesting an imminent missile strike - which Turkey denied.

Haftar has held Sirte itself since June 2019, and the neighboring Al-Jufra district since 2017.

In May, when the GNA and its Turkish (and Qatari-backed) allies pushed Haftar out of areas around Tripoli, they assumed that the General would fall back and give up Sirte easily, and that the Russians would strike a deal with the Turks and it would all lead to an end to the conflict in the GNA's favor.

That has not happened because too much oil is at stake.

The GNA and Ankara should have known this would not happen when Russian mercenaries deployed to al-Jufra. The message was clear: The Turks would not be allowed to take al-Jufra.

Indeed, Russian officials postponed a meeting in Turkey on June 14th after the Turks rejected an Egyptian-initiative ceasefire deal in Libya.

This strategic gem along Libya's coast is the entry point for the ""oil crescent"" and it's also the only point from which you can control the route to the key ports: Sidra, Ras Lanuf, Masra al-Brega, and Zuwetina

Finally, it's the gateway to eastern Benghazi, and with the Russians and Egyptians now fully on board - the new name of the game is to control everything from Sirte to Benghazi. That means controlling all the main pipelines, refineries, terminals, and storage facilities. The revenues are controlled in Tripoli, and Haftar has failed at that ploy. But if he now, with Russian and Egyptian help, manages to control this coastal stretch of territory, he will have so much leverage that he could force a deal with the GNA on his own terms.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Sirte', 'Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'France', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Russia', 'Ankara', 'Syria', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Benghazi']",Who Will Win The Ultimate War For Libya's Oil? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Who-Will-Win-The-Ultimate-War-For-Libyas-Oil.html,None,

The celebration comes after a string of territorial losses by Haftar at the hand of the GNA and its Turkish allies. While Haftar's allies (Russia, UAE, Egypt, among others) largely sidelined themselves.

The last remaining thing to capture for the GNA was the capital airport, which fell to their hands Thursday, thus--in the minds of the GNA--ending a siege of Tripoli that has lasted for over a year. On Friday, they further their gains, pushing the LNA out of the town of Tarhouna, with the next targets being Sirte and an airbase in central Libya.

Turkey is now playing the kind benefactor in this game, with Erdogan appearing for a public statement alongside GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in Ankara, saying those who have caused bloodshed would be judged by history and that the end the crisis can only be achieved politically, through the United Nations (which, incidentally, backed the GNA government way back when, though cringes at its militias).

Indeed, a lot is at stake here for Turkey, which has hedged its bets on the GNA winning in order to keep alive a new maritime boundary deal Erdogan struck with Sarraj that takes territory away from what Greece thought was its EEZ.

11402186,2020-04-07,"An oil export terminal blockade that led to the shut down of fields and refineries has so far cost Libya close to $4 billion, the National Oil Corporation said in a statement this week, adding that production was now down to below 100,000 bpd, at 89,993 bpd as of Sunday.

""NOC calls on all parties within Libya to lift the blockade and re-start oil and gas production, so every Libyan can benefit from a stronger economy and a more steady supply of fuels,"" the statement read.

Unfortunately, this could not have come at a worse time. The rest of OPEC and even non-OPEC producers such as Norway and Canada are considering oil production cuts in response to the oil price plunge that followed Saudi Arabia's announcement of plans in early March to turn the taps on and up supply to 12.3 million bpd from this month.

A group of paramilitary formations affiliated with General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army occupied the export terminals in mid-January along with pipelines and fields. The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord, which is recognized by the United Nations.

Since then, the blockade has cost Libya 1.13 million bpd in lost oil production, adding up to a cumulative 83 million barrels and financial losses of $16.586 million daily, according to data from the National Oil Corporation.

Meanwhile, the fighting continues despite numerous calls for a ceasefire, including a ""global ceasefire"" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. All attempts at instituting a truce, even for 24 hours, have so far failed as LNA's Haftar seeks control of the whole of Libya, and the GNA continues to protect its positions.

11402187,2020-03-21,"Among the world's 20 biggest oil-producing countries, there's only one that has--as far as anyone really knows--escaped the coronavirus, but it's got problems that are just as big.

Taking stock of the pandemic from the perspective of oil-producing nations is important because COVID-19 adds another major layer of uncertainty to the already devastating oil price/market share war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

And while Libya has no ""known"" cases, and Russia is popping champagne corks over the West's panic, Iran is reeling under a triple threat, Iraq just had a big operational scare, the UAE is clamping down, and the Saudis are perhaps taking measures that are too mild, too late.

It will all continue to affect oil, not simply from an economic growth and demand perspective, but an operational standpoint, too. It's not the ideal atmosphere in which two stubbornly unaccountable world leaders should be playing at a pricing war. The coronavirus may force their hands before they're ready.

But in the meantime, this is what the Oil-COVID-19 playing field looks like, and how the infection is spreading:

Africa

For once, Africa is probably the only place on the planet to be, and it's also home to four large oil-producing countries: Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, and Libya.

Nigeria has banned entry for travelers from 13 countries as it grapples with containment, though its 12 confirmed cases as of Thursday represent a more delayed spread of the virus to Africa in general.

Then we have Libya, where there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus, and no real facilities to contain an outbreak if there is, but where oil production is already halted over a new phase in an ongoing civil war.

Libya is currently producing 91,221 bpd, as production has been halted due to the ongoing civil war between the Government of National Accord (GNA) and the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) led by General Khalifa Haftar. This is now an international proxy war, with external forces lining up on opposing sides, hedging their bets on who will come out on top with the oil in hand. Financial losses due to the forced halt of oil production since mid-January are now estimated at over $3.36 billion by the National Oil Company (NOC) of Libya.

To contain an outbreak of the pandemic in Libya, the GNA on Monday suspended all flights at the Misrata Airport for three weeks, and border crossings have been ordered to close.

Algeria confirmed its 8th death from coronavirus on Thursday, with a total of 82 cases, but what observers will be watching is how this affects the year-long mass protest against kleptocratic rule, much of which had to do with the state-run oil company, Sonatrach.

The worst case in the Gulf presently is gas giant Qatar, with 452 COVID-19 cases as of Thursday. Foreigners are now banned from entry. Most of the cases are said to be related to migrant workers.

Saudi Arabia, the OPEC giant facing off with Russia in a devastating oil price war, had 238 cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday, with 67 new cases that same day.

The UAE has 140 cases, with 27 new cases just confirmed today, and it has banned citizens from traveling abroad.

Kuwait has 148 cases, with 6 new cases reported Thursday. Foreign flights have been cancelled, employees have been sent on two-week holidays, and educational institutions have been shut down, along with public markets and shopping malls.

China

China, where the virus originated, has turned a corner, with no new local infections as of Thursday. To date, the virus has killed 3,245 people in China.

Iran

Outside of China, the hardest hit is Iran, which is also suffering under U.S. sanctions and ridiculously low oil prices thanks to Russia and Saudi Arabia. As of Wednesday, Iran's death toll due to coronavirus had surpassed 1,135, spiking 15% overnight. In total, Iran now has 17,631 coronavirus cases confirmed across the country.

Iraq

In Iraq, which was already reeling from a very undefined proxy war between the United States and Iran, the industry will be twitching a bit over the decision Tuesday to halt production of 95,000 bpd from the southern Gharraf oilfield after Malaysian giant Petronas evacuated its staff over coronavirus concerns. Petronas simply evacuated, apparently without even giving Baghdad a heads-up, and because Petronas is the operator, there was no time to prepare a new operational plan.

Russia

Russia is still basking in what it appears to think is divine intervention to justify the greatness of Putin--wonderfully portrayed in this must-read Moscow Times commentary--with reportedly fewer than 100 infected.

Moscow is currently living the high life, watching a parody of Soviet-era scrabbling for staples in the West, and still pretending it's not shooting itself in the foot by taking on the Saudis (and, for good measure, U.S. shale) in a war for market share.

Kazakhstan

Two cities in oil-giant Kazakhstan are now on lockdown, as of Tuesday, after an overnight doubling of the number of cases to 33.

North America

Canada's COVID-19 death toll now sits at nine, compared to more than 150 deaths in the United States as of Thursday morning. Alberta's oil industry is what some analysts are calling on its deathbed, with the price of Western Canadian Select trading at just $5.40 on Thursday, a loss of 50% in a single day--a price point that is entirely unsustainable for the industry and well below Canadian breakevens.

U.S. coronavirus cases soared 40% in just 24 hours as of Thursday, and the total number of confirmed cases had surpassed 10,000.

Europe

North Sea oil giant Norway, while taking potshots at the unpreparedness in the U.S., has 1,442 COVID-19 cases as of Wednesday and has moved to invoke emergency powers, close borders, schools, and other public and private institutions.

The UK, which failed to digest the seriousness of the situation in Italy, where the death toll has officially outpaced China's, has 2,626 confirmed cases, with the death toll now standing at 103.

Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves, is under a nationwide quarantine due to the virus. What's particularly worrisome about Venezuela is that their entire health system has essentially collapsed and they have an insufficient number of doctors and not enough medical equipment--or even soap and water.

It's hard to assess just how serious the situation is in Venezuela due to media blackouts, but the IMF refused a loan to Venezuela to deal with the virus.

As of Wednesday, Venezuela was reportedly grappling with 33 cases of the virus.

Brazil, which produces roughly 3 million barrels of oil per day, on Thursday moved to restrict foreign visitors coming from Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Suriname, and French Guiana. It's state-run oil firm, Petrobras, has already had employees test positive for the virus and are scaling back meetings and screening ""collaborators"" at airports before arriving at production platforms.

11402188,2020-02-14,"Turkey's regional scheming and meddling everywhere from Cyprus and Syria to Libya is about one overriding thing: Israeli gas.

If Israel, Greece and Cyprus make good on plans to build an underwater pipeline to carry Israel's massive Levant Basin gas finds to Europe, then Turkey will lose any chance to make good on Erdogan's neo-Ottoman dreams of regional power.

That is why Turkey is meddling in Syria (which also has a chunk of the Levant Basin to explore), and why it's stepped into the fire in Libya with the Government of National Accord (GNA), signing a new deal to carve up maritime borders to the detriment of Cyprus in the Mediterranean. It's also why Erdogan is interfering in offshore drilling territory in Cyprus' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

So, now, what to watch? Keep an eye on any bone thrown to the Israelis that would suggest an attempt to get a gas pipe deal that would render an expensive underwater pipeline to Cyprus and Greece irrelevant.

Turkey (meaning, Erdogan) has made a collection of bad policy choices over the years, and those choices have essentially left it out of all the riches the Mediterranean has to offer.

Conflicts in the Middle East attract an entanglement of interventions, any of which could turn the region into a powder keg, and Turkish intervention in Libyan civil conflict adds a new dimension. Turkey's parliament approved a bill to deploy Turkish troops to Libya to assist and advise the forces of Government of National Accord against the forces of General Khalifa Haftar, supported by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Greece, Israel and Cyprus denounced the Turkish decision as provocative and destabilizing for the region. Behind these military and diplomatic maneuvers lie a struggle for energy and political power.

Fahreetin Altun, Republic of Turkey's communication director, announced the aim on Twitter: ""Turkey will work toward defending the international law, achieving security, and preserving peace in Libya and the Eastern Mediterranean. We will prevent any effort to exploit the conflict in the region. At the same time, we are also ready to cooperate on establishing stability."" A UN agreement formed Libya's Government of National Accord in 2015, supported by the United States and the European Union.

Avoiding containment: Turkey and Libya sign an agreement on maritime boundaries, responding to plans by Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Greece to develop natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean (Source: Anadolu Agency)

Yet oil is at the center of this conflict as the Turkish government pursues aggressive foreign policy against a coalition of Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Greece in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Turkish policy began with a signed agreement on Mediterranean maritime boundaries with Libya - a response to Cyprus forming the coalition to develop the Eastern Mediterranean energy sector. Turkish authorities described its agreement as a means to prevent the coalition's attempt to encircle Turkey. Greece, Israel and Cyprus denounced the Turkish-Libyan agreement as provocative, suggesting it undermines international efforts to stabilize the region. Those countries also signed a pipeline deal for shipping natural gas from the Eastern Mediterranean to Europe. Turkey's diplomatic move was also a response to attempts to exclude Turkey from Mediterranean gas exploration. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an insisted that no project can proceed without Turkey's consent following its deal with Libya.

Cyprus regards Turkey's attempt to explore gas in the Eastern Mediterranean as provocative. The European Union has threatened sanctions, and the US Secretary of State has described Turkey's activities as ""illegal."" Even so, Fatih Donmez, Turkey's energy minister, declared such activities will ""continue with determination."" Hence, the government views intervention in Libya as the only way to achieve Turkish goals for the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkish troops will work to secure the government of Libya against General Haftar's forces. Turkey also sought to guarantee its seat in the international conference on Libya held in Berlin in January.

Turkey seeks to use its military power to force other countries in the region to accept its demands, as it did with two interventions in Syria. However, the consequences of sending Turkish troops to Libya could be more disruptive for domestic politics than the interventions in Syria for four reasons.

First, the 2016 attempted coup resulted in a rise of nationalism and anti-Americanism in Turkey after public opinion assumed the soldiers who joined were linked to NATO and the US-supported cleric Fethullah Gülen, a notion reinforced by the Turkish government.

Second, the government had revised its vision on Syrian policy, focusing on destroying the Syrian Democratic Forces, a group that had garnered sympathy from the West for their steadfast defense of Northern Syria against the Islamic State. A majority of Turkish citizens supported the interventions, accepting these as war against the terrorist group PKK, after documents suggested that Abdullah Öcalan, imprisoned PKK leader, formulated the democratic-self administration program of Syrian Democratic Forces during peace negotiations in 2013. Threats of US sanctions also helped Turkish leaders win domestic support.

All political parties in the Turkish assembly, except the People's Democratic Party, supported the policies in Syria. However, Turkey's gains remain unclear. Furthermore, the intervention had costs: 180 lives lost in Operation Euphrates Shield, Operation Olive Branch and Operation Peace Spring. Defense spending expanded, representing 12.9 percent of the total budget, and the unemployment rate increased to 14 percent, with the currency flailing and inflation exceeding 11 percent in December.

Third, the nationalist atmosphere posed negative consequences for the Syrian refugees in Turkey as well as the Erdo?an government. Turkish nationalists blame the government's refugee policies for the country's economic problems, and Erdo?an had announced a plan to send refugees to the safe zone in Syria. Many Turks did not see that settlement plan as viable, and Turkey's many political parties were not keen to take another risk as the government attracted international condemnation for its actions in Syria.

The Republican People's Party, the Good Party and the People's Democratic Party rejected the bill to deploy Turkish troops in Libya. The opposition labeled the new adventure in Libya as a neo-Ottomanist policy. The Future Party, led by former Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto?lu - the key person behind Turkey's Syrian policy - also opposed the decision to send troops to Libya.

The opposition parties support diplomacy and dialogue, and the Republican People's Party, the main opposition party in the assembly, holds a view similar to that of NATO, claiming that supporting one side during internal conflicts can promote instability. The Good Party and People's Democratic Party also suggest that the government's aggressive policies during the Syrian War and Arab Spring, supported by leaders linked with the Muslim Brotherhood, resulted in Turkey's isolation and destroyed good relations with Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and Iran.

Fourth, critics questioned the creation of new alliances in Libya. While Turkey, Iran and Russia close in on a deal for Syria, Russian support to the regime in Idlib triggered another refugee crisis. Over the next few months, hundreds of thousands of more people may head for the Turkish border, and Turkey has not signaled how it will handle this challenge.

The Idlib crisis and Turkey's intervention in Libya may put Turkey and Russia at opposite sides once again. A ceasefire for Libya brokered by Russia and Turkey began 12 January. If international conferences do not achieve peace, Turkey could destroy its relationship with Russia and result in total isolation for Turkey in the region.

All in all, the Turkish gambit has two goals. First, it desires to keep the GNA in power in Libya to secure advantages in the Eastern Mediterranean and increase economic activities in North Africa by using the nation as an entryway. By sending troops to Libya, Turkey secures a seat at international conferences deciding the country's fate. Turkey uses its military power for diplomatic advantages, but at the risk of losing respect in the international arena. Among the outcomes in the Berlin conference is a call for termination of all military movements by, or in direct support of, the conflict parties in Libya. Countries that do not abide by the arms embargo could face sanctions, which could be a useful tool for Erdo?an in the domestic arena.

The more important goal for the Erdo?an government is restoring popularity at home. Economic problems, rising of secularism among young generations and authoritarian tactics contributed to the government's losses in 2019 municipal elections, especially in Istanbul. Moreover, the Justice and Development Party is in crisis, as former party leaders create new political parties: the Future Party of Davuto?lu and another to be announced under the leadership of Ali Babacan, former economic minister. Erdo?an may sense his only option is to rely on threats from other countries, instigating nationalism, to restore his popularity.

The international arena, in that sense, should work to find new solutions to develop diplomacy and dialogue throughout the Middle East and discourage interventions. Imposing sanctions on Turkey only increase nationalism, an appeal to historical glory under Ottoman rule legitimizing anti-democratic and anti-liberal governance.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Turkey', 'Syria', 'Libya', 'Israel', 'Greece', 'Egypt', 'Cyprus', 'Russia', 'Berlin', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Idlib Governorate', 'Lebanon', 'Iran']",Turkey's Latest Power Grab Has Europe On Edge | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Europe/Turkeys-Latest-Power-Grab-Has-Europe-On-Edge.html,None,

A Sunday report by the Wall Street Journal added a key pipeline to the list of blocked assets that will affect Libya's oil production adversely for at least a few days.

The pipeline connects the largest field in Libya, Sharara, and neighboring El Feel, to the Zawiya export terminal. According to the Libya Observer the pipelines were more than one. In any case, Sharara and El Feel together produce a sizeable portion of Libya's total output, with Sharara alone capable of pumping 200,000 bpd.

The Libyan National Oil Corporation declared force majeure on oil exports soon after the news of the seizures broke and warned the blockade could cost the country $55 million daily, the Libya Observer reported. The blockade will also cost Libya between 500,000 and 800,000 bpd in lost oil production, according to different reports. Before the blockade, Libya was pumping around 1.3 million bpd.

Bloomberg quoted an unnamed source as saying production could drop as low as 72,000 bpd if the export halt extends and storage tanks get full.

Al Jazeera reports the terminals and the fields were seized on Friday as a challenge to the GNA, who Haftar has been fighting for several months now with the ultimate goal of removing the government from power and, according to him, unifying Libya. Haftar and his Libyan National Army is loyal to the rival government in the East.

""Haftar's General Command and the Petroleum Facilities Guard of the Central and Eastern Regions have instructed the managements of Sirte Oil Company, Harouge Oil Operations, Waha Oil Company, Zueitina Oil Company and Arab Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), subsidiaries of the National Oil Corporation, to stop oil exports from Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina, and Sidra ports,"" a statement by the company said as quoted by the Libyan news outlet.

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on December 23 warned that Moscow was expecting ""nothing positive"" in ties with the United States.

Ryabkov struck a similar note in an interview with Russia's news agency Interfax, saying the country should move to a ""total containment"" approach in relations with Washington and retain ""selective dialogue"" on subjects that are of interest to Moscow.

He said that Russia would not initiate any contacts with Biden's transition staff, and would also not make any ""unilateral concessions.""

And if the United States continued approaching Russia as a ""strategic rival,"" then Moscow would ""treat them in a similar way,"" the deputy foreign minister added.

Referring to U.S. sanctions imposed this week on 45 Russian companies with alleged ties to the country's military, Ryabkov said the outgoing administration was trying to ""slam the door loudly"" on Moscow, with the trend likely to remain when Biden moves into the White House.

""We are going from bad to worse. This was very typical for the past four years and so far there is no feeling that this trend has outlived its usefulness,"" Ryabkov said.

Speaking to reporters, Peskov said Russia had been ""consistently getting new sanctions. So, there is nothing positive so far, unfortunately,"" in Russia-U.S. relations.

Separately, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov promised a response to the new U.S. sanctions and said that the United States had ""long been pursuing a hostile policy"" toward Russia.

The comments come a day after Biden called on Trump to publicly identify the perpetrator of a large-scale breach of U.S. government agencies -- a hack some of Trump's top allies have blamed on Russia.

In a speech in Delaware, Biden faulted the Trump administration for stripping U.S. defenses against cyberattacks and pledged a tough response when officials discover who was behind the cyberintrusion.

The hackers ""can be assured that we will respond and probably respond in kind,"" he said.

The U.S. administration has not made a formal assessment of who was behind the attack, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr said all signs pointed to Moscow.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Moscow', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Ukraine', 'Libya', 'Delaware']",U.S. Relations With Russia Could Crumble Under Biden | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/US-Relations-With-Russia-Could-Crumble-Under-Biden.html,None,
11402229,2020-12-17,"Commodity trading giant Trafigura expects a strong rebound in oil demand next year thanks to mass vaccinations, which will push crude oil prices to $55-60 a barrel, Argus Media reported, citing the company's chief economist Saad Rahim.

""You have already seen a strong recovery in many places -- certainly in China, but also in Europe and Japan, for example. The United States is lagging in some parts, but I think we can see some stronger momentum. India had taken a major hit, but the momentum there is also looking strong,"" Rahim told Argus.

China's oil demand has certainly rebounded, with processing rates at Chinese refineries hitting all-time highs in October and November. Indian demand is also firmly on the mend as people opt for personal rather than public transport, boosting demand for gasoline.

Europe, on the other hand, is still battling with surging Covid-19 infections, with several countries recently announcing tighter lockdowns despite the coming holidays to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Yet Trafigura's chief economist is upbeat about oil's immediate future, noting stimulus measures implemented by European governments and a pending crisis relief package discussed by U.S. lawmakers.

And this is before you have the proper rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines,"" Rahim also noted.

Interestingly enough, the executive brushed off Libya's addition of more than 1.2 million bpd in oil production to OPEC's total at a time when the cartel is trying to keep output lower to keep prices higher.

""The Libyan volumes have come on very quickly, so they are not really going to add many more barrels there. And the market has absorbed those volumes, meaning that demand is already looking much healthier,"" he told Argus.

Indeed, depite the inflow of Libyan oil into markets, oil prices have risen over the past couple of weeks despite continued worry about the future of demand. The main drivers of the rally have been positive vaccine news reports and the demand rebound in Asia, notably in China and India.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['China', 'United States', 'India', 'Japan', 'Libya']",Trafigura Sees Oil At $60 Thanks To Vaccines | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Trafigura-Sees-Oil-At-60-Thanks-To-Vaccines.html,None,
11402230,2020-12-16,"Saudi Arabia reduced its budget plan for 2021 by 7 percent from this year's in response to the economic fallout of the pandemic, which pushed oil prices to multi-year lows.

Reuters reported that Riyadh will spend some $264 billion next year, or 990 billion riyals, as it battles a substantial deficit resulting from the latest oil price collapse.

Earlier this year, the Kingdom was forced by oil market circumstances to implement some unpopular austerity measures, including a triple increase in value-added tax and the cancellation of so-called cost-of-living allowances for much of the population. While the government insisted these were not austerity measures, the fact of the matter was that the drop in oil revenues threatened the economy of OPEC's number-one exporter.

Saudi Arabia expects its 2020 deficit to hit $79.40 billion (298 billion riyals), representing 12 percent of gross domestic product, all because of the drop in oil revenues, which is seen at more than 30 percent this year. In 2021, however, the government expects the deficit to shrink to 4.9 percent of GDP and return to balance by 2023.

These expectations likely mean Saudi Arabia is banking on a pretty strong recovery in oil prices next year. It is not alone in this: Goldman Sachs recently said it expected Brent crude to rise to an average $65 a barrel in 2021 thanks to the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines that will stimulate oil demand growth. Yet there is always a risk that this might fail to pan out: Libya is pumping 1.28 million bpd, and OPEC will start adding another 500,000 bpd to daily production from January 2021 while mass vaccinations will take at least several months.

The Saudi finance ministry has acknowledged the challenging environment.

""In view of the uncertainty surrounding the pace of the global economic recovery and the potential persistence of the crisis, predicting the state of the oil market becomes increasingly challenging,"" the ministry said in a statement as quoted by Reuters.

Yet, separately, Minister of Finance Mohammed al-Jadaan signaled optimism: ""I think that the economic recovery of economic activities in the third and fourth quarters bodes well for economic growth in the coming years,"" he told media.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Riyadh', 'Libya']",Low Oil Prices Force Saudi Arabia To Cut 2021 Budget Plan | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Low-Oil-Prices-Force-Saudi-Arabia-To-Cut-2021-Budget-Plan.html,None,
11402231,2020-12-16,"Crude oil prices rose to the highest since early spring after the FDA yesterday gave the green light to the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, with government officials saying several hundred vaccination sites across the country would be supplied with vaccines by tomorrow. But traders -- who have been buying oil and fuels futures with renewed eagerness over the past few weeks -- are now preparing for a market correction. Traders from hedge funds slowed down their purchases of crude oil and derivatives contracts, Reuters' John Kemp said in his weekly column, noting that this is the fifth week in a row when traders have been buying with a voracious appetite.

This appetite will be difficult to sustain, though, even after vaccinations start in the United States, for two main reasons: how long it will take to vaccinate the population and oil's fundamentals.

The regulatory approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the United States was a major step in a bullish direction for oil, but it was the first of many. Challenges remain concerning both availability and logistics. CNN reported yesterday that while the first medical workers were vaccinated on Monday, it would take months for most Americans to be vaccinated.

The federal government bought 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine earlier this year, which means 50 million people will be vaccinated since it's a two-dose vaccine. Pfizer has now said it would be unable to supply additional quantities until the middle of next year.

In short, it will be a while before things begin to return to normal.

Europe is also in an uncertain position with vaccinations. Governments are wary of making the Covid-19 vaccination obligatory, but there is growing public mistrust in the Covid-19 vaccines that may compromise efforts to achieve herd immunity through inoculation.

Then there is the question of oil supply and demand that could take the wheels off this latest price rally. OPEC is preparing to start pumping half a million barrels daily more from January. The U.S. is already pumping more, and so is Libya, the latter of which produced 1.25 million bpd earlier this month.

At the same time, OPEC yesterday lowered its oil demand forecast for this year. The cartel now expects demand to have fallen by 9.7 million bpd since the start of the year, averaging 89.99 million bpd. The demand projection for 2021 was also revised down. OPEC now expects 2021 oil demand to average 95.89 million bpd, which would be a solid improvement on 2020 but still 410,000 bpd lower than earlier projections.

Then there's Iran, which last week said it expected to be exporting 2.3 million bpd of oil next year, confident it could reach a deal with the Biden administration regarding sanctions that are currently stifling its oil exports. A deal is not exactly certain: while Biden has signaled he is ready to negotiate, Iran has in its turn signaled it would not be the first one to make concessions. Also, the U.S. energy industry is not looking forward to another price slump and might exert some pressure on the president-elect.

At the same time, the Asian recovery from the pandemic is certainly bullish for oil, as is Europe's exit from the second round of lockdowns. According to a recent Bloomberg report, fuel inventories have been draining steadily, with India, China, and Japan reporting a rebound in gasoline demand. For many analysts, the rebound is only a matter of time, and this time appears to be next year, putting upward pressure on prices despite the challenges.

""Oil is the cheapest of all reflation assets,"" according to Energy Aspects' Amrita Sen, who spoke to Bloomberg. ""With vaccines slowly rolling out, we expect investors to start returning to the oil sector and for prices to continue firming.""

""Price momentum has slowed appreciably during the past couple of weeks and while some fresh or unexpected bullish headlines may be required to advance the complex into new high territory, we will also note a market that appears to have developed immunity to bearish headlines that would normally be slapping the complex down,"" another analyst, Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch Associates, told Reuters.

The clouds over oil, in other words, are beginning to clear. It might take a while for them to clear completely, but demand is on the mend, and ultimately, this is the single most important factor right now.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Japan', 'India', 'China']",Is It Time For A Correction In Oil Markets? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Is-It-Time-For-A-Correction-In-Oil-Markets.html,None,
11402232,2020-12-15,"Oil prices have finally hit $50 last week, a projection that we made back in June this year. Bullish sentiment prevailed in the oil markets over the past week despite a significant increase in US crude oil inventories. Traders are expecting demand to pick up next year as vaccination campaigns are rolled out worldwide. Yet recent traffic data shows that road traffic is still below pre-crisis levels by 5% in Asia, 20% in Europe, and 40% in the US. The recent growth in US crude inventories is clearly due to an increase in imports and a decrease in exports. The EIA figures continue to show that demand is slowing in the United States, not only due to reduced mobility but also due to the beginning of winter season. US refinery runs are currently 2.16 million bpd below their level a year ago.

OPEC+ is set to meet this week to review November production compliance data, and with Brent currently trading above $50, the group has a good reason to celebrate the new year. While OPEC+ is set to add 500,000 bpd of production in January, it is still too early to conclude that OPEC+ will add an additional 500,000 bpd in February. Oil markets remain volatile and uncertainty continues despite the bullish sentiment seen over the past few weeks. Yet we expect the group to go ahead with its pre-set plans if prices continue to trade at this level.

The largest risk for prices currently is slowing demand and a simultaneous increase in supplies, despite vaccination campaigns. A new bout of lockdown measures in Western Europe has markets worried that optimism about the recovery could have been premature.

OPEC+ needs to stay vigilant in 2021 as COVID-19 cases continue to rise around the globe, with US COVID-19 deaths exceeding the level of 3,000 a day. Meanwhile, positive news on the COVID-19 vaccine front continues to support the markets, outweighing concerns excessive growth in US crude inventories and soaring production in Libya.

Furthermore, a recent statement from US President-elect, Joe Biden, indicates that the United States will return to the JCPOA pact leading to the lifting of sanctions against the Iranian regime if Iran adheres to strict compliance with the nuclear deal. Although signing another deal may not be as easy as it seems, it is expected that the new US administration will not be as strict as the Trump administration when it comes to crude oil exports from Iran. Iran has been reported to have instructed its oil ministry to prepare its oil facilities for production and export at full capacity within the next three months. Iranian exports in 2018 reached a peak of 2.6 million bpd. This presents a major risk for the markets being over-supplied in 2021 as Iran remains exempt from the OPEC+ agreements.

Another issue is the compliance among the OPEC+ group members, which despite being better managed in 2020 compared to previous years, remains a risk. Currently, over-producing members have until the end of Q-1 2021 to compensate for their over-production. Yet, economic situations among the OPEC+ members remain different, meaning that certain countries cannot meet their budget requirements with the allocated quota at current oil prices. This may lead to the issue of non-compliance in 2021 despite a higher allocated quota.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Iran', 'Libya']",Will Oil Continue To Rally In 2021? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Will-Oil-Continue-To-Rally-In-2021.html,None,
11402233,2020-12-15,"Structural underinvestment in oil and gas will put upward pressure on oil prices, Goldman Sachs' commodities chief Jeffrey Currie told CNBC this week, commenting on commodity markets.

All markets except wheat, Currie noted, are in a deficit, and this is certainly bullish for prices. But what he calls structural underinvestment also has its part to play for the future of prices. This is particularly true for oil, where the underinvestment is not just motivated by the price rout but by the shift towards renewable energy investments.

This shift, however, may stimulate short-term demand for oil, Currie also noted, expecting it to rise over the next few years as so-called green infrastructure is being built. Afterward, as this infrastructure starts operating, there will be a negative impact on oil demand and, likely, prices.

Oil started this week with a gain as the United States began vaccinating its frontline workers, but by the end of trade, prices were on the decline again as worry about excessive supply outweighed the positive news about the vaccines.

A supply and demand update from OPEC also weighed on prices, as the cartel revised down its forecast for oil demand for this year and next. In addition, Baker Hughes' latest rig count report for the U.S. showed the most rig additions since January, fueling the oversupply worry. On top of it all, Libya has continued to boost its production, with the average daily hitting 1.28 million bpd this month, up from 1.25 million bpd at the end of November.

Despite the current challenges, Goldman is bullish on oil, expecting Brent to average $65 a barrel next year. The investment bank cited mass vaccinations and the limited increase in production from OPEC+ as factors driving the favorable trend.

11402234,2020-12-15,"OPEC has lowered its oil demand forecast for 2020 again, according to the latest version of the Monthly Oil Market Report released on Monday.

OPEC now expects global oil demand to fall to 9.77 million barrels per day in 2020 to reach 89.99 million barrels per day this year, compared to over 90 million bpd projected for its November MOMR.

OPEC's projections for 2021 oil demand is 95.89 million bpd, down 410,000 from its projection of 96.3 million bpd that the group made in its November MOMR, and 96.8 million bpd that it made in its October MOMR.

Meanwhile, OPEC's oil production increased in November, according to the latest MOMR, adding 707,000 bpd on average, mostly from Libya -- not beholden to the production quotas--which accounted for 656,000 bpd of the increase.

Production increases were also seen from Iran (+39,000 bpd), the UAE (+75,000 bpd), and Venezuela (+25,000 bpd).

OPEC has agreed to lift production by 500,000 bpd next year and will reevaluation where the market is to determine the next month's quota. OPEC will hold their next meeting on January 4.

Libya has voiced its plans to increase its oil production and has previously stated that it will not accept any production quota until such a point where it can reliably produce 1.7 million bpd -- compared to its current 1.108 million bpd.

Iran, too, has promised to increase its oil production to 2.3 million bpd in 2021, up from 1.986 million bpd now.

11402235,2020-12-14,"The Libyan government recognized by the UN has told Libyans not to panic and queue at gasoline stations in the country because there is enough supply of fuel, Libya Herald reported on Monday.

In recent days, people have been queuing at gasoline stations due to rumors about shortages, but the country's Interior Ministry said that a fuel tanker carrying 35 million liters of fuel had recently arrived at the port of Tripoli. Fuel supplies to gasoline stations across Libya have already started, and the stations will work around the clock, the ministry added, as carried by Libya Herald.

Brega Oil Marketing Company said this weekend that the Anwar Africa tanker had arrived at the port of Tripoli, according to The Libya Observer. The fuel marketing company said that there was sufficient supply of both gasoline and diesel and that people shouldn't pay attention to rumors about an imminent shortage of fuel.

Rumors about a fuel crunch come just as Libya had managed to restore its crude oil production back to the levels last seen in January this year, before the eight-month-long blockade of the ports and oilfields.

Libya's crude oil production has already returned to 1.25 million bpd, the level the OPEC member exempted from the OPEC+ cuts was pumping before the port blockade in January.

The faster-than-expected increase in Libyan oil production is giving OPEC and its allies in the OPEC+ group another issue to discuss at their monthly meetings that will be held starting in January, on top of the outlook for oil demand early next year. OPEC's crude output jumped in November by 750,000 bpd, with Libya accounting for most of that increase, according to the monthly Reuters survey.

Earlier this month, Libya's UN-recognized government said that an urgent meeting of all stakeholders involved had agreed to work toward unfreezing Libya's oil revenues, an essential part of the OPEC member's budget income.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Brega']",Libyan Government Denies Gasoline Shortage | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyan-Government-Denies-Gasoline-Shortage.html,None,
11402236,2020-12-07,"Despite the OPEC+ decision to ease output cuts, oil prices have rallied over the past couple of weeks, supported by vaccine news and the start of vaccination campaigns across the world. Although the OPEC+ decision is seen as a compromise among the major group producers, the group has clearly realized that their decision is also a warning for the member states that are falling behind on their compliance targets. Adding 500,000 bpd starting from January will mean that many countries including Russia and Iraq which contributed to almost half of the 2.35 million barrels excess supply in 2020 will see their compliance exceeding 100% if they stick to their agreed new production targets.

Saudi Arabia and Russia will share 50% of the agreed ease of output cuts

According to Russian energy minister Novak, his country's share of the incremental rise will be 126,000 bpd while Saudi Arabia is expected to have an equal share. This means that Saudi Arabia and Russia will have a quota of 9.119 million bpd in January, followed by Iraq at 3.857 million bpd and UAE at 2.626 million bpd. The total OPEC production quota is estimated to be 22.119 million bpd, up by 304,000 bpd from its quota between August - December , while the rise in non-OPEC quota is estimated to be 196,000 bpd.

On the other hand, the risks associated with this decision will include a slow demand recovery, especially in Q-1 2021 as COVID cases continue to surge, and uncertainty about the speed and effectiveness of the global COVID vaccination campaigns continues.

Another risk is the rise in production especially from Libya and Norway. Libyan production currently stands above 1.2 million bpd and is likely to keep on rising, while Norway will be ending its voluntary output cuts at the end of 2020, which means its production will return to 1.75 million bpd in 2021, up by 134,000 bpd. The production capacity of Norway's huge Johan Sverdrup field alone is already expected to reach 720,000 bpd by Q-4 2022

As a whole, OPEC+ is expected to add 500,000 bpd on a monthly basis to reach a total of 2 million bpd in additional production in April 2021. Yet, this plan will be subject to recommendations of JMCC, the committee that monitors OPEC+ production, which is set to hold its next meeting in January 2021.

From now till Christmas, we expect oil markets to keep the current momentum going, propped up by news of vaccine developments, and a weaker dollar. The recent move by Saudi Aramco to raise its OSPs to Asia by $0.80 should support this momentum further. Another pillar of support is the investor exodus from safehaven assets such as gold and the US dollar to high risk equities and commodities.

Demand seen weaker in the US, but future looks bright

US oil demand is slowing, and despite the decline in crude oil stocks in the United States last week, gasoline and diesel inventories have risen mainly due to persistent lockdown measures and end of year winter season demand.

Current apparent demand in the US stands at 15.96 million bpd, down by 705,000 bpd w/w, falling to the lowest level in four weeks. The last EIA inventory report was somewhat bearish as it revealed unexpected growth in gasoline and diesel inventories, which rose by 3.5 million barrels, and 3.2 million barrels, respectively. Current crude oil stocks stand at 488 million barrels, just within the five year average, 52.7 million barrels below their peak levels last July, yet 37.5 million barrels above their level a year ago. Nonetheless, the trend has been quite stable over the last four weeks, reflecting a much slower pace of decline compared with the pace of decline seen between August-October. Although it is still early for OPEC+ to celebrate, current levels should provide some relief if they are compared with the market's abysmal status earlier this year, which shows that the group is on the right track.

The number of US rigs continues to rise, reaching 246 rigs, up by 74 rigs from its lowest level seen last August, yet with a muted effect on prices as the bullish news continue to outweigh a potential rise in US production. Meanwhile, prices are near $50, something we had predicted back in June, pointing at what looks like the beginning of a real recovery.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Norway', 'Libya', 'Iraq', 'United States', 'United Arab Emirates']",The OPEC+ Mission To Balance Oil Markets Is Just Getting Started | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-OPEC-Mission-To-Balance-Oil-Markets-Is-Just-Getting-Started.html,None,

""We expect prices to be, on average, at $45 next year for Brent,"" Fitch senior director Dmitry Marinchenko told CNBC today.

""This assumes that the demand will remain weak until at least the second half of the year, because the progress with mass vaccination probably will not be very quick,"" he added.

Vaccine news sent oil prices higher at the end of last month, and the fact that OPEC+ had achieved an agreement on the next steps in the production cut deal after long debates helped them stay higher this week.

However, this may soon change as the challenges around vaccine distribution and the fact that there will be more OPEC+ oil coming into markets next year sink in. And that's without counting Libya, which continues to boost its production, unbound by the OPEC+ deal.

Vaccines are unlikely to significantly affect oil prices, Marinchenko told CNBC, going counter to widespread expectations that once a vaccine is widely available, oil demand will quickly rebound.

In evidence that mass vaccination will not be as simple as many may want to believe, Pfizer said earlier this week it will only ship half of the vaccine doses it originally planned for this year because of supply chain problems.

""With weak demand, and with OPEC trying to manage supply ... to avoid large surpluses or deficits in the market, we expect prices to be at $45 next year,"" Fitch Ratings' Marinchenko said.

If you recall, this was General Haftar's biggest issue: He controlled the oil but all the revenues were going to the Central Bank and essentially being used to undermine his authority.

A meeting earlier this week of representatives of the internationally recognized government, the Central Bank of Libya, and the National Oil Corporation (NOC) decided to ""Look into mechanisms to lift the current freeze and restore matters to normal, with emphasis on activating the monitoring mechanisms and adherence to the standards of disclosure and transparency,"" the Tripoli government said, as carried by Libya Herald.

Libya has restored the level of oil production back to volumes it was pumping before the blockade of its oil ports and oilfields in January this year, but the revenues from oil sales have been the sticking point in returning to normal operations.

At the end of last month, NOC said it would not be transferring the revenues from crude oil sales to the Central Bank of Libya until the bank adopts transparent policies on the spending of those revenues.

NOC was responding to a statement from earlier in November from the Central Bank, which, the oil firm says, provided false and misleading figures about the revenues and expenditures between January and October this year.

Hedge funds and other money managers have been net buyers of the most important petroleum futures and contracts since November 9, when Pfizer and BioNTech started the race to take vaccines to approval within weeks and to people within months.

At the end of the most recent reporting week to November 24, portfolio managers held the most bullish overall position in oil in three months -- since the end of August, suggesting that the market hopes that vaccines will help global oil demand.

The overall net long position -- the difference between bullish and bearish bets -- in futures and options in the six most important petroleum contracts was equivalent to 617 million barrels on November 24, according to data from exchanges compiled by Reuters market analyst John Kemp.

That's the most bullish net long position in oil held by money managers since the end of August, just before the second COVID-19 wave swept through the United States and major economies in Europe, forcing renewed lockdowns and curfews in the biggest European economies Germany, UK, France, Italy, and Spain, to name a few.

Despite the gloomy outlook for oil in the nearest term because of the virus and continued restrictions in major economies, the oil market has been looking a few months further down the road since vaccine announcements started giving hope to speculators that some form of normality of life and travel could return after the middle of 2021.

The question now is: how much of that hope has been already priced into the recent oil rally over the past three weeks, considering that the actual direct correlation of mass vaccination on oil demand is likely to manifest itself in the second half of 2021, at the earliest.

Hope could sustain oil prices through the first half of 2021, but the market will also have to look at the supply-demand picture, which is less rosy, especially if OPEC+ doesn't deliver the expected extension of the current oil production cuts. At the time of writing early on Wednesday, OPEC and OPEC+ had adjourned talks about the future of the cuts until Thursday as disagreements persist.

In the week to November 24, money managers boosted their bullish bets on WTI Crude and Brent Crude by 67,000 lots to 542,000 lots -- a three and a half-month high. Some of the 183,000 bullish lots added since the first vaccine announcement on November 9 ""could be at risk should OPEC+ unexpectedly fail to deliver a cut extension,"" Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Tuesday.

Beyond the OPEC+ group's immediate decision, oil prices and the mood on the market will also be dictated by the alliance's decisions all throughout 2021, as well as supply and demand issues.

On the supply side, the risks are skewed to the downside, with oil production from Libya -- exempted from the OPEC+ cuts -- surging, and Norway ending its oil cuts at the end of this year and adding 134,000 bpd to global oil supply as of January 1.

On the demand side, vaccines could boost oil demand in the latter half of 2021, but a weaker rebound in demand early next year because of the second COVID wave could slow down the drawing down of oil and product inventories which, at least in the United States, are still above the most recent five-year averages.

11402241,2020-11-30,"While there was a lot of uncertainty about the OPEC+ meeting, this headline (from Bloomberg) was not one of them...

*SAUDI ARABIA MULLS RESIGNING ROLE AS CO-CHAIR OF OPEC+ JMMC The reaction in crude prices was insta-selling, pushing WTI back below $45...

While the headline is unclear, it strongly suggests that the discord within OPEC+ is far greater than was believed; and the fact that it is only these relationships that are holding the entire energy complex up in the face of lockdown-inducing demand slumps is worrisome.

The move is likely simply a negotiating ploy to drive UAE to agree to extend production cuts (which will require prices to drop first to apply that pressure).

OVERVIEW:

OPEC and OPEC+ producers are meeting on November 30th and December 1st respectively, to discuss and draft a potential tweak to the current Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), rolled out in light of the pandemic to recalibrate the demand /supply imbalance. Monday's meeting is slated for 13:00GMT, subject to delays. The current DoC is split into three phases:

Market expectations are still leaning towards the second tranche (7.7mln BPD cuts) being extended through Q1 2021, a view which was also backed by Goldman Sachs, ING, and UBS, despite positive vaccine developments and amid rising production in Libya. Recent sources also noted OPEC+ is still leaning towards a rollover of the current tranche notwithstanding the recent oil price rally, albeit with some sources suggesting by 2-3 months and some through Q1 whilst the most recent sources suggested 3-4 months- with Russia also likely to agree to the full quarter if necessary. However, enthusiasm for cuts is not universal - with some OPEC+ officials cited by EnergyIntel to not be on board with the full ""plan"" on Sunday. Russia is also said to insist on gradual monthly increases in output from January, sources stated.

SUNDAY JMMC MEETING

The informal consultation between Russian, Saudi, and JMMC heads was moved to Sunday ahead of the decision-making meeting. The panel of OPEC+ ministers could not reach an agreement on the extension of current cuts, with most participants reportedly supporting a delay of hikes through Q1 2021, but UAE and Kazakhstan opposing. Tass citing sources said Russia and Saudi Arabia have reached consensus on extending the current level of cuts through the first months of next years, but the two producers still had to ""coordinate 'certain details and the mechanism' of the extension"". Meanwhile, sources cited via Argus Media on Sunday said ""A rollover would most likely be for one quarter... This would avoid flooding the market in January-March - a period of typically slower demand.""

NOVEMBER JMMC FALLOUT

The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) statement on November 17th gave no detail on its recommendations but said it will be provided on December 1st. The Committee reiterated the ""critical importance of adhering to full conformity and compensating the overproduced volumes, in order to achieve the objective of market rebalancing and to avoid undue delay in the process."" There was also chatter that OPEC+ is mulling deeper production cuts, though this was dismissed by delegates on Sunday who suggested no talk of collective deeper cuts.

COMPLIANCE COMPLICATIONS

Compliance among producers remains an issue as the latest October figures from the JMMC suggest sub-par conformity, namely from UAE, Nigeria, Iraq, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, and Azerbaijan for a total group cumulative overproduction of 2.346mln BPD (see Figure 1).

Some sources suggested that OPEC+ compliance could still be an issue, however, EnergyIntel's Bakr noted that ""The expectation among delegates is that the ""'catch up cuts' plan will be extended into 2021 to allow a number of states to reach their quotas""

Desks did not expect these compliance difficulties to be a near-term risk given the ""vigilant and proactive"" stance signaled by OPEC+ in recent meetings, with the group likely to reaffirm its stance on full compliance and specifics likely to be ironed out in the coming months with further compensation quotas.

DEMAND AND OIL PRICE DEVELOPMENTS

The positively received vaccine updates from Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE /BNTX), Moderna (MRNA), AstraZeneca (AZN/Oxford), and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) have provided a rosier (or less dire) demand outlook for the complex due to the prospect of a recovery in activity and jet fuel demand. Still, re-emerging COVID-19 cases and uncertain timeframes for mass rollouts of approved vaccines continue to cloud the near-term outlook. Analysts at Goldman Sachs indicate that this solidifies the argument for an extension of current cuts. Further, IEA's November OMR also suggested ""it is far too early to know how and when vaccines will allow normal life to resume. For now, our forecasts do not anticipate a significant impact in the first half of 2021."" Nonetheless, the vaccine fanfare this month has provided the crude market with a boost, resulting in the Brent curve edging back into backwardation (theoretically a near-term bullish signal) - Figure 2 below indicates the shallowing contango following the releases of each of the three major vaccine updates.

However, ING is skeptical about the recent Brent backwardation into early 2022 given the soft near-term demand outlook and fragile balance sheet over Q1 2021, whilst the WTI curve makes more sense, with timespreads in contango in the near term (reflecting weaker fundamentals) but with backwardation commencing from the May 2021 contract.

The oil producers will have to factor in supply-side developments since the rollout of the DoC, events that were not foreseen nor assumed at the time:

FORECASTS:

Analysts at GS forecast Brent to average USD 47/bbl in Q1 2021 assuming a three-month extension of current cuts, whilst an adherence to the current DoC (i.e. a 2mln BPD production increase) would warrant USD 42/bbl in the period. ""This illustrates once again how short-term revenue maximization always comes through production cuts, as a 2 mb/d production increase but $5/bbl negative price impact would end up reducing core-OPEC and Russia's 1Q21 fiscal revenues by more than $5 bn"", GS says. Meanwhile, UBS sees a Brent average of USD 45/bbl in Q1 next year (see Figure 3 below), with the assumption of a vaccine rollout in 2021.

11402242,2020-11-30,"Driven by a faster-than-expected comeback of Libyan oil production, OPEC's crude output jumped in November by 750,000 barrels per day (bpd), the fifth consecutive increase in the cartel's production, the monthly Reuters survey showed on Monday.

The 13 members of OPEC have produced a total of 25.31 million bpd in November, a massive 750,000 bpd increase from October as Libya's oil production rose by nearly 700,000 bpd, according to the Reuters survey of ship-tracking data and sources from OPEC, consultants, and oil companies.

OPEC's crude oil production in November was the fifth increase in output since the 22.69-million-bpd low the cartel was estimated to pump in June -- the lowest level of OPEC production since the 1991 Gulf war.

According to the Reuters survey for November, top producer Saudi Arabia kept its production steady compared to October, as did Kuwait. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been rumored to be reconsidering its position in OPEC, increased its oil production by 90,000 bpd, but was complying with its quota.

Libya, which is exempted from the OPEC+ production cuts, single-handedly offset the compliance with the cuts, which, as per the Reuters survey, stood at 102 percent in November.

Production in the other two OPEC members exempted from the OPEC+ pact -- Iran and Venezuela -- also increased, according to the survey.

Libya's oil production has returned to 1.25 million bpd, the level it was pumping before the port blockade in January. This poses another conundrum for the OPEC and OPEC+ members whose energy ministers meet virtually on Monday and Tuesday to decide how to proceed with the current production cuts. Libya has said that it would not join the OPEC+ quotas until its output stabilizes at 1.7 million bpd.

The Libyan surge in production and the weaker outlook about oil demand in view of the surging COVID-19 cases in major developed economies are complicating the OPEC+ task this week. The market largely expects the current cuts of 7.7 million bpd to be rolled over for another three months to March 2021, instead of eased by 2 million bpd from January 2021, as originally planned.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Kuwait', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Venezuela', 'Iran']",OPEC Oil Output Soars As Production Cut Decision Looms | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/OPEC-Oil-Production-Soars-As-Production-Cut-Decision-Looms.html,None,

The U.S. benchmark WTI Crude is set to average $46.40 per barrel next year, compared to $46.03 a barrel expected in the previous month's poll, according to the survey of 40 economists and oil analysts.

The experts see Brent Crude averaging $49.35 a barrel in 2021, slightly down from $49.76 per barrel expected in October's survey.

So far this year, Brent Crude prices have averaged $42.50 a barrel.

According to most analysts polled by Reuters at the end of November, the positive news about vaccine breakthroughs in recent weeks will not help global oil demand much early next year, as the coronavirus cases surge in major economies, leading to renewed lockdowns.

A potential vaccine rollout is set to help fuel demand in the latter half of next year, analysts believe.

Despite the recent bullish sentiment on the markets because of encouraging news about vaccine development, the outlook for global oil demand remains weak for next year, especially in the early months.

Growing supply out of Libya, exempted from the OPEC+ cuts, could also weigh on oil prices, the analysts said in the Reuters poll.

Libya's oil supply and the demand outlook for the short term are also the key issues that the OPEC and OPEC+ meetings will be considering on Monday and Tuesday when deciding how to proceed with the oil production cuts.

There have been reports that the group is leaning toward extending the current cuts of 7.7 million bpd by another three months to March 2021, instead of easing those cuts by 2 million bpd as of January 2021.

OPEC+'s meeting that was put on the books at the last minute for Saturday is now being delayed to Sunday, according to anonymous Reuters sources.

No reason for the meeting delay has been given.

The group had decided to get together at the last minute, ahead of the November 30 and December 1 full meetings, to discuss things about the plan for oil production starting in January.

The group is expected to come to some sort of agreement on relaxing the current production quotas that OPEC+ is currently tasked with meeting. Most analysts expect that the group will extend the current agreement into 2021, for a period of three months.

But one item that is less clear is the by-country quotas -- whether all countries will have the same quotas for the additional three months, or whether there will be changes for specific countries -- with some being asked to cut more and some being allowed to cut less.

One country that is currently in question is Libya, which has been adamant that it not be part of any efforts to curb production until it reaches a point where it can consistently produce 1.75 million barrels of oil per day.

Other questionable matters include Nigeria, which has asked -- much like Russia -- to have condensates (a lighter-gravity crude that if often blended with other crude grades and is typically harder to refine in large quantities) backed out of its calculations. This would no doubt ensure Nigeria's compliance without having any effect whatsoever on the group's attempt to drawdown oil inventories.

The UAE is another country that may give OPEC a headache, signaling that it might be unhappy with its current OPEC membership and quota.

State giants China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) are interested in buying ExxonMobil's entire operating stake in one of the largest oilfields in Iraq, West Qurna 1, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.

The potential stake sale of Exxon's 32.7-percent interest in West Qurna 1 could be worth at least US$500 million, but final decisions haven't been made yet, and a possible deal could be hampered by geopolitical uncertainties in OPEC's second-largest producer, Bloomberg's sources said.

ExxonMobil signed in 2010 an agreement with the South Oil Company of the Iraq Ministry of Oil to rehabilitate and redevelop the West Qurna I field in southern Iraq. Exxon is the lead contractor, while a Royal Dutch Shell affiliate was also holding a stake under the 2010 agreement.

In 2018, Shell sold its stake in West Qurna 1 to Japan's Itochu Corporation. The Japanese firm currently holds 19.6 percent in the oilfield. Apart from Itochu and the lead contractor Exxon, the other shareholders in West Qurna 1 are PetroChina with 32.7 percent, Indonesia's Pertamina with 10 percent, and Oil Exploration Company with 5 percent.

11402252,2020-11-19,"While the OPEC+ group considers extending the production cuts for three months, oil output in Libya continues to increase and has returned to 1.25 million bpd, the level the OPEC member exempted from the cuts was pumping before the port blockade in January, Argus quoted Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) as saying on Thursday. The state corporation has also discussed potential fresh investments from France's supermajor Total in Libya's oil industry, NOC said, as carried by Argus.

If Libya's current level of production holds, it will give OPEC+ another headache next year, considering that Libya is exempted from the cuts and at the time the new OPEC+ pact was agreed, the North African producer was pumping less than 100,000 bpd due to the eight-month-long blockade that ended in September.

At the end of last week, Libya's production was already exceeding 1.2 million bpd, sources in the Libyan oil industry told Reuters.

Production in Libya started to rise in the middle of September after the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) of General Khalifa Haftar lifted the blockade on Libyan oil fields and terminals. Since mid-September, Libya's NOC has gradually lifted force majeure on the oil terminals and oilfields, and Libya's crude oil production rose from below 100,000 bpd during the blockade to as much as 500,000 bpd in the middle of October.

Within a month, Libya's production could reach 1.3 million bpd, NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla told the Wall Street Journal last week.

Even though Libya's oil production has hit 1 million bpd, the OPEC member will not join the OPEC+ quotas until its output stabilizes at 1.7 million bpd, Sanalla told Wall Street Journal reporter Benoit Faucon.

French Total plans to increase its investments in Libya's oil industry, the National Oil Corporation said, adding it had discussed with the company raising Libya's production to ""the highest levels.""

Total has stakes in several Libyan oil fields, including the nation's biggest, Sharara. The field, along with many others, was shut down for more than eight months this year after groups affiliated with the eastern government blockade oil export terminals, which pushed Libya's oil output from above 1 million bpd to less than 100,000 bpd.

In late September, when the Libyan National Army started lifting the blockades from the terminals, production began increasing and has to date topped 1.2 million bpd. However, earlier this month, NOC warned that this level of production may not be sustainable.

""The National Oil Corporation asserts that it may not be able to sustain the current production levels and these levels may be reduced or totally ceased under the reluctance of some entities and their hindering of NOC's efforts to increase production and restore the prosperity of the national economy,"" the company said in a statement.

Even so, Libya has signaled it would not be joining the OPEC+ production control effort, from which it has been exempted due to the frequent production outages caused by the conflict between the eastern-affiliated LNA and the Government of National Accord, which was recognized by the UN.

In fact, NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla recently said that Libya might consider joining the cuts only when it reaches a production level of 1.7 million bpd. This would be more than the country produced prior to the 2011 civil war that saw the end of the rule of Muammar Ghadaffi.

Libya's fast production ramp-up has added one more pain to OPEC's already substantial load as the cartel still grapples with a global oil supply overhang that has been slow to decline amid the continuing pandemic.

11402254,2020-11-16,"OPEC+'s technical meeting finished on Monday with widespread support for a three-month extension of the current level of oil production cuts, sources told Reuters on Monday.

OPEC sources hinted last week that many members were in support of extending the production cuts that were supposed to ease 2.0 million bpd in January, to 5.7 million bpd.

Other members were in favor of even more drastic measures, which included cutting deeper come January.

While the agreement of the group to keep at it seems to have the support of most members of the group, challenges remain. Some members, including Iraq, have signified that they may not be onboard with an agreement unless it garners unanimous support from all members.

Meanwhile, Libya, which has intimated that it demands to continue to be exempt from the production cuts until its production stabilizes around 1.7 million bpd, keeps adding production to the mix now that the blockade that has plagued the country for months has ended. This reality has added nearly a million barrels per day into the mix at a time when OPEC+ is desperately trying to remove barrels from the market.

No matter how many barrels of oil the extension of the current level of cuts actually removes from the market, any move by OPEC+ to extend the cuts beyond January will be received favorably by the market and should life oil prices.

Despite OPEC's best efforts to rebalance the oil markets, the cartel has been under the gun with oil demand falling considerably with the pandemic lockdowns.

Oil prices were eagerly waiting for direction from the group, and by 3:15 p.m. ET, Brent was trading up $1.08 (2.52%) at $43.86 per barrel.

The compliance last month has been estimated at 101 percent, three sources at OPEC+ told Reuters on Friday.

This assessment is subject to official review by the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of OPEC+, which is meeting on Monday, November 16, a day before the monthly meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) scheduled for Tuesday.

In September, the overall compliance of the OPEC+ pact participants was at 102 percent, the highest since May 2020, the JMMC said after its meeting in October, when it urged full compliance with the quotas and ""reminded all participating countries of the necessity to be vigilant and proactive given the precarious market conditions and prospects.""

The market conditions and prospects have become even more precarious in the month since the mid-October meeting, as major economies in Europe re-imposed various forms of lockdowns and curfews to fight the renewed spike in COVID-19 cases. Earlier this week, OPEC revised down its expectations for global oil demand -- its fifth consecutive downward revision -- as the coronavirus resurgence is slowing down the oil demand recovery.

Slowing demand recovery and a surge in production among OPEC's own, exempt member Libya, after an eight-month-long port blockade, is prompting the OPEC+ group to reconsider its plans for easing the current cuts by 2 million bpd in January.

Next week's JMMC meeting doesn't have the authority to change a deal, but it can recommend actions to the full OPEC+ meeting scheduled for December 1, with an OPEC meeting set for November 30.

11402258,2020-11-12,"With Europe and North America falling ever deeper into the quagmire of second-wave coronavirus lockdowns and curfews, caution has become the universal buzzword. In Asia, however, the anticipation of worse things to come has given way to a cautious optimism that has prevented Middle Eastern differentials from falling. Amidst Libya coming back to the global markets and OPEC+ discipline weakening, that is a remarkable feat attesting to the robustness of the Asian market. Buttressed by the market contango, refiners in India and China are ramping up imports to meet increasing demands for gasoline and diesel, nudging Middle Eastern differentials higher.

Saudi Aramco's front-month official selling price routinely set the mood for other Middle Eastern producers, too, providing the general direction prices will be heading in the upcoming weeks. The Saudi national oil company has adopted a policy of minimal month-on-month twitching with its Asia-bound December 2020 official selling prices to Asia (the biggest move was a 20 cent per barrel m-o-m cut to Arab Super Light, brought about by light distillates margins weakening lately). At the same time, Asian demand has become much more oriented towards Middle Eastern supplies on the back of Urals arbitrage closing down and US grades becoming a tad less competitive than previously. Europe-bound Saudi OSPs have been hiked to match Urals' appreciation, US-bound prices were dropped 20 cents per barrel across the board.

By the time the Saudi OSPs reached the market, a change of mood was already present within the trading community, reflected in the cash-Dubai futures spread moving into positive territory on November 06, the day after Saudi Aramco's issuance of its December 2020 OSPs. Given that other Middle Eastern producers are overwhelmingly lacking the lighter end of grades, their December 2020 differentials have largely gone up. ADNOC has raised its Asia-Pacific prices of flagship grades Murban and Upper Zakum by 10 cents per barrel from November 2020. The Iraqi SOMO went even further and seeing the positive developments around increased the December OSP for Basrah Light by 15 cents per barrel month-on-month, to a $0.45 discount against Platts Dubai/Oman (Basrah Heavy rose by 10 cents per barrel).

There are several reasons why it is only now that Chinese demand is bouncing back. Chinese crude imports in October 2020 reached a 6-month low at 10.4mbpd, however this was to a large extent due to China digesting the massive crude stocks it kept floating next to its terminals. Roughly 4 million tons of crude were cleared off the port congestion list, tangibly easing the pressure on the relevant ports in the Northeast. Cognizant of the risks refiners were running if they were to store the crude offshore for a period longer than financially expedient, Chinese authorities have also facilitated the discharge of crudes - from now on, cargoes can be discharged before the quality inspection is finalized by the customs staff. November, largely free from the constraints of past month, will witness a solid rebound in imported volumes to China, to the extent of 11.2-11.3mbpd.

Crude demand from India and South Korea has also been instrumental in turning the tide of the Asian market. One of the star performers of the COVID pandemic, South Korea has managed to pull off the unthinkable and return to pre-COVID levels of crude imports - in August 2020 it was importing some 2.5mbpd crude, by October 2020 the rate rose to 2.93mbpd. Although India has managed to increase its crude imports by 20% from the July low-point of 3.26mbpd, the world's biggest democracy still has untapped capacity to work with. Before COVID, India's average monthly refinery runs used to hover in the 5-5.2mbpd interval yet currently they are somewhere around 4.3mbpd, meaning some 0.7-0.9mbpd refining capacity remains unused. This gap might be narrowed in November 2020 as the 360kbpd Vadinar refinery will come back from a month-long maintenance.

There are two ways to assess crude exports - either from the seller's point of view (i.e. taking the vessel's departure date as the basis of reference) or from the buyer's one (in such a case it is the date of arrival that matters). Now if we look at China's crude imports from the perspective of their arrival, November 2020 will mark the highest-ever volumes arriving from Saudi Arabia. From the seller's perspective, October was alright but by no means ground-breaking. Considering the 20+ days voyage from Ras Tanura, the outstanding result is due to the buying spree of Chinese refiners in the second half of October - from October 13 onwards, 25 vessels have loaded and sailed to China (roughly equivalent to the total number of vessels moving to China in the good old pre-COVID times). Ras Tanura departures in November are already weaker, therefore the October peak of Saudi imports is highly unlikely to be maintained for long.

Simultaneously to the above-mentioned Saudi developments, October 2020 seems to have attained an all-time record in volumes sailing from the United States towards Asian refiners. In general terms American exports have been sagging a bit globally in the past 3-4 months, having lost 20-25 million barrels in monthly aggregate terms from levels seen in H1 2020 (to some 130 MMbbls), however Asia is one of the few destinations that have witnessed a tangible ramp-up for US exporters. Provided there is no major disruption on the receiving side, imports from the United States to Asia will amount to 2.15mbpd in November 2020, more than half a million barrels per day higher than the previous peak marked this September. Similarly to Saudi volumes, a part of the US export momentum will peter out in the upcoming weeks, although not to the extent that exports from Europe did (dropping to a mere 8 MMbbls in the whole of November as the arb ran out).

In a concurrent development, Abu Dhabi's national oil company ADNOC and the newly formed ICE Futures Abu Dhabi (IFAD) have been making headway in using the emirate's Murban futures contract, assumed to be launched in late March 2021, as a market benchmark for US crude exports to Asia. Having only signed memoranda of understanding with leading US oil firms, ADNOC and IFAD still cannot be sure of Murban's success despite promising early signs.

11402259,2020-11-12,"The five largest producers of crude oil in Africa face a combined production decline of 19 percent as a result of the pandemic's effect on oil demand and the acceleration of energy transition efforts, according to a new report by PwC.

The Africa oil and gas review 2020 notes that the pandemic has caused the worst oil industry crisis in history and that oil demand will likely never recover to pre-pandemic levels.

This demand loss will also drive lower revenues for oil exporters, the authors of the reports said, helped in no small measure by the green transition.

""With the oil price at approximately $40 per barrel, oil-exporting countries will experience long-term decline in their export revenues as a result of the renewed weakness in global oil prices, coupled with the accelerated transition to renewables in key importing countries,"" the authors said.

""Covid-19 has not only caused the biggest global oil demand slump in history, at nearly 40 times worse than the global financial crisis of 2007, but has, in fact, accelerated the global energy transition by as much as five years, as the developed world uses the renewable energy transition to anchor economic stimulus packages and new economic diversification,"" the report also said.

The report suggested that African countries -- particularly the oil producers, including Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Libya, and Algeria -- could benefit if they choose to use their oil revenues for the early adoption of renewable energy.

Overreliance on oil revenues is known to be a problem, especially for developing economies but weaning an economy off petrodollars has proved challenging even for affluent Gulf producers. This means African oil exporters have a tough challenge to overcome if they are to diversify away from oil and into renewable energy, especially since governments there cannot afford to be as generous with green-focused economics stimulus as EU governments.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Nigeria', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Algeria', 'Angola']",African Oil Producers Face Slump In Production | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/African-Oil-Producers-Face-Slump-In-Production.html,None,

The OPEC+ group is getting closer to deciding how to proceed come January, according to several delegates who shared this insight with Bloomberg.

After discussing the options, which included deepening the existing production cuts, OPEC+ is now considering a three- to six-month delay to the originally scheduled ramp up that was set to begin in January.

The deeper cuts option, however, failed to gain much traction, according to one delegate.

On November 30 and December 1, OPEC+ will make its final determination in how it will proceed come January.

Currently, the group is cutting about 7.7 million bpd, and some OPEC members are ready for the nightmare that is the production cuts to be over -- like the UAE and Iraq.

Libya, too, has stated that it would not join in any production cuts until its production had rebounded and stabilized at 1.7 million bpd -- from its current 1 million bpd.

If Libya's production does rebound to 1.7 million bpd in the next couple of months, it would make OPEC's production cuts even more critical for oil prices.

While vaccine news has been promising OPEC's MOMR failed to put much stock in a speedy oil demand recovery in 2021, and actually reduced its oil demand outlook for next year by another 300,000 barrels per day.

Even if the group decides to delay the lifting of some of the group's oil production in January, it could change its strategy if the market gets too far out of whack.

However, the market watches all OPEC moves closely, and if they decide to add more production in at a faster pace than they decide at the end of November, it could send prices downward again -- something many OPEC members cannot afford.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Iraq', 'United Arab Emirates']",OPEC+ Getting Closer To Hatching January Plan | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Getting-Closer-To-Hatching-January-Plan.html,None,
11402261,2020-11-11,"The major participants at ADIPEC 2020's ADNOC Trading Forum expressed a wide range of sentiment, but the general message was one of caution or even outright pessimism when it came to oil price movements. The Virtual Conference, which was held in Abu Dhabi, was dominated by three main topics, the impact of COVID-19, global oil and gas demand destruction, and the U.S. election results. With a wide range of speakers including representatives from Abu Dhabi's national oil company ADNOC, the major storage company VITOL, Japanese company ENEOS, Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), and OMV amongst others, the forecasts for 2021 were plentiful and varied. The main takeaways for observers were that markets may be growing increasingly optimistic about a COVID recovery, but oil prices are unlikely to see a real recovery before the end of 2021. Oil market fundamentals are very weak at the moment and even if a COVID-19 vaccine is produced, the impact on fundamentals will be slow. Furthermore, any oil market recovery could easily be halted by a change in the strategy of OPEC+ or any other supply increase before demand picks back up. According to Energy Intelligence, Platts and Argus, the overall expectation for oil prices in 2021 is in the high $30s to mid $40s per barrel. In a panel with Martin Fraenkel, Euan Craik, and Alex Schindelar, all three industry leaders agreed that they expected a more optimistic situation in 2022. The three oil analysts emphasized that much will depend on the success of tackling COVID globally and the resilience of the market in the face of a possible supply boost.

Russel Hardy, the CEO of Vitol, argued that 2020 has shown how resilient the hydrocarbon sector still is. Despite the major breakdown of demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hardy claimed that Vitol has been able to ride out the storm and is fully prepared for 2021. While a combination of negative prices, demand destruction, and a storage glut means that a return to normal is still a long way away, an industry recovery is well and truly underway. Kajo Fujiwara, the Executive Officer of Crude Trading and Shipping for Japanese company ENEOS emphasized that ""work continued even in COVID time"". He said that was particularly difficult as a state of emergency had been put in place in Japan as its refineries were forced to cut, exports decreased and margins were very low. The company's investment plans were also altered as several projects were delayed. In H2, however, ENEOS saw refinery runs increase and signs of demand recovering.

When asked about ADNOC Trading, Khaled Salmeen, the Executive Director, stated that the company ""has not stopped doing what we wanted to do....we wanted to go strong on trading and we are as ADNOC Global Trading is going to go live in the coming weeks"". When asked about the impact of COVID on trading, Salmeen stated that for his company it had been an opportunity, as working on risk management and pricing has allowed the company to become more resilient. ADNOC Trading is developing well, with the crude book having gone live in September and the products book via Global Trading set to go live in the coming weeks. ADNOC is now starting to train and support the next generation of traders in the UAE. An ADNOC Trading official added that ADNOC Trading plans to set up representation internationally, including in the U.S. As well as trading, Salmeen confirmed that ADNOC Trading is also looking at entering the shipping space. ADNOC has always been an FOB seller. Shipping is now going to be a major part of the company. The cost of both second hand and new vessels in the current climate is extremely attractive for those with capital.

Overall it was a mixed takeaway from the event. COVID is once again hovering over markets with a second round of lockdowns in the EU, and price volatility has increased. For some, such as Hardy, real optimism could return to markets in H1 2021. There doesn't seem to be any significant demand increase set to take place in winter and even if a COVID vaccine is produced, the real impact won't be felt in the market before end H2 2021. At the same time, all participants agreed that the OPEC+ strategy is one of the major factors to watch. Vitol expects normal stock levels by Summer 2021, but even that will depend on OPEC+ strategies. New additional production, such as from Libya or Iran, could set markets back. A return to normal stock levels would see prices rising at the end of 2021. Hardy is cautiously optimistic but admits that it all depends on a continuous flow of ""good news"". The Vitol official expects oil prices to recover to the high 40s or even the 50s in H1 2021, although any demand reduction would hurt that prediction.

When asked about Biden, Hardy said that any U.S. supply response would be price related. He stated that if Biden rejoins JCPOA and Iranian oil flows again, prices will be hit hard. He doesn't expect the Biden Administration to have much of an impact on U.S. shale production though. While new regulations would impact production by increasing overall costs, the sector itself is largely non-political.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Abu Dhabi', 'Japan', 'United States', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Libya', 'Iran']",An Oil Market Recovery Is On The Horizon | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/An-Oil-Market-Recovery-Is-On-The-Horizon.html,None,

Oil prices skyrocketed on Monday after Pfizer announced that its vaccine would be more than 90% effective for the coronavirus. The announcement rippled across financial markets, with the share prices for Zoom crashing, but the stocks for cruise lines, airlines, and automakers, among other sectors, all shooting up. With markets contemplating the possible end of the pandemic sometime next year, optimism returned in a big way. Needless to say, crude oil had its best day in months, soaring more than 10%. The uplift also led to huge gains for the share prices of many oil companies.

Covid cases surging. Vaccine optimism will be tempered by the negative short-term outlook, with Covid-19 cases out of control in the U.S. and in Western Europe. ""The market has now priced in an effective vaccine in the near future,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research, told Bloomberg. ""There's still the problem of the second wave and that's going to affect demand in the near-term.""

Citibank cuts 2021 forecast to $49 WTI. Citi revised down on Monday its outlook for the WTI Crude price for next year by $5 to $49 a barrel, citing the global spike in coronavirus cases that is set to impact oil demand. Vitol CEO Russell Hardy said he sees Brent going to $50 in the next few months.

Mountain Valley Pipeline sees construction blocked. A circuit court temporarily blocked the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline over concerns about its impact on waterways. The court issued a stay while an appeal of permits makes its way through the legal process. The MVP project would carry Appalachian shale gas to the U.S. southeast.

BP and Orsted team up on green hydrogen. BP (NYSE: BP) and Orsted A/S (CPH: ORSTED) said they would work together on developing an industrial-scale electrolyzer to make green hydrogen at an oil refinery in Germany. If successful, 50 megawatts of North Sea wind would help produce enough hydrogen to power 20% of the refinery's needs.

Peabody warns of Chapter 22. Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) warned that it faces the possibility of its second chapter 11 bankruptcy in five years.

Energy lobbyists line up at Biden admin. While election drama continues, energy lobbyists are wasting no time switching over from the Trump administration to the Biden administration. The Washington Post reports that lobbyists from multiple sectors - coal, oil, gas, renewables, trucking - are flipping their scripts from deregulation to something that could work under the Biden administration, such as big stimulus on infrastructure and reduced trade tensions with China.

Texas RRC tightens flaring rules. The Texas Railroad Commission said it would shorten times that companies are allowed to flare and it also said companies would be required to disclose more detail on why they need to flare. The tweak is relatively minor, and the RRC is under pressure from big oil companies themselves to tighten the rules.

NextEra Energy bids $15 billion for Evergy. NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), the world's largest solar and wind developer, is hoping to purchase Evergy Inc. (NYSE: EVRG) in an all-stock deal worth $15 billion. Evergy rejected the offer.

U.S. Midwest utilities shift to renewables. Six Midwest utilities said they would spend a combined $15 billion on renewables over the next several years with the aim of building more than 4 GW of solar, 3.6 GW of wind, and 1 GW of energy storage. They also said they plan on continuing to shutter coal plants.

IEA: Renewables growing faster than expected. The IEA published its Renewables 2020 report, in which the agency predicted that wind and solar capacity will double over the next five years globally. By 2023, solar and wind capacity will overtake natural gas capacity, and renewables will surpass coal by 2024. The agency also said that while much of the energy sector was hit hard due to the pandemic, renewables proved ""more resilient than previously thought."" The IEA revised up its 2020 forecast for renewables by 18%.

Wall Street flocking to EVs. At least nine EV startups have gone public, or will soon, according to Axios. Companies span the sector, including EV cars, heavy-duty trucks, parts manufacturers, infrastructure, etc., and capital is pouring in.

U.S. LNG to China to grow substantially. After a year of non-existent liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from one of the fastest-growing global suppliers, the United States, to the fastest-growing world importer, China, American LNG cargoes started to travel again to China in March this year. Cheniere Energy (NYSE: LNG) has recently signed a framework agreement with China's Foran Energy Group to sell 26 LNG cargoes to the Chinese company over the next five years.

11402264,2020-11-09,"Oil prices jumped in early Monday trading on a new wave of optimism that a Covid-19 vaccine could be closer than ever to becoming a reality. WTI Crude was up 10.8% to trade at $41.16 per barrel after dropping to $35.80 about a week ago on news that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's (NASDAQ:BNTX) Covid-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, has been more than 90% effective in preventing infections in early efficacy tests. The oil and gas sector in general is showing major strength, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) having surged 11.8% in the pre-market in what is shaping up as the sector's best one-day performance in the year-to-date.

Big Oil has not disappointed either, with the two biggest names Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp.(NYSE:CVX) up 11% each in pre-market trading.

There is good reason to be optimistic because the two companies' plan to make an emergency use authorization (EUA) application as early as the third week of November if the vaccine passes safety tests.

However, whether those gains will stick remains to be seen, bearing in mind that the Pfizer study was done on just 96 participants, and the vaccine has yet to pass the critical safety milestone. Further, the energy sector's long-running supply/demand imbalances are not going anywhere.

Current indications are that another glut could soon come calling unless OPEC+ agrees to reverse its earlier decision. The organization has plans to ease output reductions on January 1, a move that will effectively add another 1.9 million barrels a day to the market. This is not being helped by events in non-OPEC markets. For instance, a succession of storms crossing the Gulf of Mexico has curtailed American production by some 500,000 barrels/day since the end of August, but most of the production that was cut during the hurricanes has already been restored. The situation could become murkier as Libya ramps up production -- which has already recovered to roughly 1 million barrels per day.

No Green New Deal to Texas?

Stocks of Exxon, Chevron, and other Texas oil producers have been soaring after Republican businessman Jim Wright trounced Democratic challenger lawyer Chrysta Castañeda to retain control of the Texas Railroad Commission. Castañeda had sought to put climate change on the energy regulator's agenda but failed to break the Republican Party's 26-year stranglehold on TRC despite receiving the backing of former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg who poured $2.6M into the race. Wright mainly received contributions from political action committees for energy companies such as ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV).

Exxon has been desperately pulling on all the levers in a bid to get through the oil slump with its dividend intact but could be running out of options. The company has announced that it will cut 15% of its workforce in order to protect its fat dividend (10.6% yield) and also slash capital expenditure--again. During its Q3 earnings call, Exxon revealed that revenues had cratered 29% Y/Y to a below-consensus $46.2B while Q3 GAAP loss totaled $680M compared with a profit of $3.17B for last year's comparable quarter with its refining business especially hard hit. Further, the company says it expects 2021 Capex to be as low as $16B after cutting 2020 Capex from $33B to $23B in the current year.

Exxon has resorted to doing something that's a bit out of character with its proud tradition: Begging for aid. The oil giant is urging Australia's government to start releasing aid to oil refineries days after its British peer, BP Plc. (NYSE:BP), announced a decision to close its Australian refinery--the country's largest. XOM says the proposed six-month time frame for talks with the government is way too long given how dire the situation has become.

Exxon is also pondering something else unExxon-like: A major asset writeoff. The company is currently reassessing its North American natural gas holdings and could impair a staggering $25B-$30B. Wall Street has been hard on XOM for the company's earlier refusal to lower its capital spending and reluctance to adjust the book value of its assets to reflect the current reality. Writeoffs on such a massive scale are likely to be jarring for a company that's already deeply out of favor with XOM stock down 51% in the year-to-date.

Given this backdrop, here are three energy stocks that could be better bets than Exxon.

Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) is a pure-play LNG operator of facilities that liquefy natural gas. U.S. LNG exports are one of the few sectors of the energy market that remain in decent shape. LNG exports have been soaring since August, thanks to weather-related demand. Cheniere and other natural gas players have also been gaining after China's Foran Energy Group signed a deal with the company to export LNG starting 2021 through 2025. The deal is a clear signal that Chinese firms expect business relations between the two countries to normalize under Biden after a choppy period under Trump. Chinese firms had eschewed longer-term contracts with U.S. exporters after the Trump government imposed heavy tit-for-tat tariffs on shipments.

Although the fate of Biden's $5 trillion Green New Deal hangs in the balance after Democrats failed to win the Senate outright, natural gas has been rapidly replacing coal in power generation in the U.S. and throughout the world. Natural gas is being viewed as an important bridge in the shift to renewables, a powerful secular trend that's bullish for LNG operators like Cheniere.

Iowa-based Renewable Energy Group (NASDAQ:REGI) is a biodiesel production company operating 13 biorefineries and a feedstock processing facility. The company manufactures biodiesel and renewable diesel from biomass feedstocks such as animal fats, distilled corn oil, and even used cooking oils.

REGI stock has been enjoying a torrid run, up 117.3% YTD and 243.2% over the past 12 months, thanks in large part to Biden's victory

At a time when demand for transportation fuels has been drastically reduced by the coronavirus pandemic, diesel fuel demand has generally held up better compared to the demand for gasoline and jet fuels. Renewable Energy Group has also been benefiting big time from California's newly reinstated Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits when it sells biomass-based diesel in the Golden State, even if the fuel is manufactured in Iowa.

During its latest earnings call, REGI reported that it produced 132M gallons of biodiesel and renewable diesel during the quarter, a 4% increase. The company also reported a surprise Q2 profit as well as better-than-forecast revenues of $546M. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue climbed to 5% vs. -5% of revenues a year ago. REGI was also able to sidestep volatile feedstock markets by increasing its use of soybean oil 126%, which gave a nice boost to the bottom line.

Overall, with the largest and most efficient operating footprint in its history, REGI appears well-positioned to increasingly invest in profitable growth and lower its reliance on amorphous tax credits.

Few energy companies are growing their top lines in this environment, let alone make any kind of profits--and Canacol Energy (OTCQX:CNNEF) has been able to do both. Canacol is a Canadian firm involved in the production of oil and natural gas in South America, primarily in Columbia and Ecuador.

During its latest earnings call, Canacol reported revenue of $54.41M (+14.1% Y/Y) and GAAP EPS of $0.10 thanks to its liquid natural gas sales increasing 46% Y/Y.

Libya's crude oil production topped 1 million bpd, the National Oil Corporation said this weekend, although it added this level of production may not be sustainable.

""It is worth mentioning that the National Oil Corporation faces very big financial difficulties and a huge shortage of its budgets which led to accumulating of debts on the sector's companies and significant delay for the salaries of its service companies,"" the NOC said.

""The National Oil Corporation asserts that it may not be able to sustain the current production levels and these levels may be reduced or totally ceased under the reluctance of some entities and their hindering of NOC's efforts to increase production and restore the prosperity of the national economy,"" the company added.

Libya has been ramping up its crude oil production since late September when the LNA blockade on oil ports began to be lifted. In less than six weeks, then, NOC managed to bring average daily production from less than 100,000 bpd to 1.03 million bpd.

The state oil company has already called on the Government of National Accord to release the budget funds that it needs to pay off the debts it accumulated during the nine months of the blockade. It also incurred losses of some $10 billion for the duration of the blockade, the NOC said in October.

At the moment, the GNA is negotiating a ceasefire with the Libyan National Army, and the latest reports point to progress being made. The question remains, however, whether there is enough money in Tripoli's coffers to keep the oil pumps going.

Libya's returning production has added considerable pressure on oil prices as it comes at a time when demand growth is once again in jeopardy because of the resurgence in Covid-19 cases and when OPEC+ is discussing deepening its production cuts to stabilize prices.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli']",Libya's Oil Output Hits 1 Million Bpd | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyas-Oil-Output-Hits-1-Million-Bpd.html,None,
11402266,2020-11-06,"When the pandemic pummeled the oil industry in the spring, many called the situation unprecedented. Prices were falling because of oversupply, but demand was failing to react to lower prices because of the pandemic. Then China's lockdown ended, and the industry breathed a sigh of relief. Things were going to get back on track. But now lockdowns are being implemented once again and a return to 'normal' seems as far away as it has ever been. The UK enters a month-long lockdown today. The country is nowhere near as essential for oil demand as China or India, but that is not what is important. What's important is the fact the UK - and Germany and France before it - needed a second lockdown to handle the coronavirus that wrecked global oil demand in the spring. That's why the announcement sent oil prices falling and even an 8-million-barrel weekly draw in U.S. crude oil inventories couldn't bring benchmarks higher.

Reuters' Kemp noted in his weekly column on oil that sentiment among traders had flipped from optimism to pessimism for the next six months. Earlier, there appeared to be a decent level of confidence that supply will tighten over the period, and this would push prices higher. Now, fear is resurging that consumption could remain lower than supply amid the current wave of infections. And it seems China is unlikely to come to the rescue this time.

Earlier this year, Asia's largest economy went on an oil-buying spree, taking advantage of historically low prices. Refiners ramped up their run rates as industrial activity returned to life. And then storage space began filling while demand for the products refiners churned out remained weak. After hitting all-time highs in late spring and early summer, China's oil imports started declining. According to analysts, this quarter, oil imports will be lower than in the third quarter, but traders will be keeping a close eye on developments to see just how weak they will be.

Meanwhile, in the Middle East, OPEC producers are discussing something that just a couple of months ago would have been unthinkable. They are considering deepening their production cuts instead of relaxing them as planned earlier this year or extending the current rate of production curtailments.

It was agreed in April that the current production cuts, a historic 9.7 million barrels per day, would be relaxed to 7.7 million barrels per day from July. Then, as per the original agreement, the cuts were to be further relaxed to 5.7 million bpd from January 2021. Those plans were thrown out the window when prices failed to rebound, and the cartel stuck with the original cuts through July. The moment they started ramping up production, prices fell. Now, some OPEC members want to keep ramping up, and one of them isn't even asking for permission.

Libya has been exempt from OPEC+ oil production control deals because of its domestic troubles that have seen numerous production outages at its oil fields and export terminals. Those ports were blockaded in January this year, leading to a slump in oil production from over 1 million bpd to less than 100,000 bpd. And then, in September, the blockade ended, and Libya started ramping up. To date, the country is producing 800,000 bpd that is flowing into a market that already has too much oil.

Meanwhile, travel restrictions remain, stumping any potential oil demand recovery. OPEC doesn't have a lot of options amid budget deficits and austerity measures, so it is not really a surprise that it is talking about returning to the 9.7-million-bpd cuts. Unfortunately, even this might not help prices: traders are already prepared for an extension of the current production level, and they will quickly factor in a return to 9.7 million bpd. Prices may inch up for a while, but to hold higher, they would need some reliable, good news, such as a successful vaccine for Covid-19.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United Kingdom', 'China', 'United States', 'India', 'France', 'Germany', 'Libya']",The Oil Price Rally That Never Was | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Oil-Price-Rally-That-Never-Was.html,None,
11402267,2020-11-05,"Oil prices dropped on Thursday morning as a highly contested presidential election continued to be too close to call as of 11 a.m. ET, although Democratic candidate Joe Biden was within six electoral votes to win.

As of 11:37 a.m. ET on Thursday, WTI Crude was down 1.53 percent at $38.47, and Brent Crude was trading down 1.50 percent at $40.74, as Biden was in the lead in electoral votes over President Donald Trump.

A Trump win would be more bullish for oil, analysts say, because of the President's continued pro-oil policies. Biden, on the other hand, has said he would seek a path of diplomacy toward Iran, which could potentially bring Iranian barrels back to the oil market at some point next year under a Biden Administration.

Yet, a President Biden would not be as bad for oil prices as it would look on the face of it, analysts say. First, they expect a weaker U.S. dollar, which typically boosts oil prices because crude becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies. In addition, Republicans are set to keep the majority in the Senate while Democrats have lost a few seats in the House -- this, according to analysts, would keep a President Biden from passing climate policies that could be too harsh on the oil industry.

""A Trump win will likely to be bullish for oil, at least more bullish than under a Biden administration,"" Tamas Varga at oil brokerage PVM told Reuters.

Oil prices jumped on Wednesday after the EIA reported an 8-million-barrel draw in crude oil inventories in the United States last week.

This draw, a weaker U.S. dollar, and surging risk appetite after the 'blue wave' in the U.S. election failed to materialize, supported oil on Wednesday.

""However, with Biden on the brink of a narrow win, a continued surge in Covid-19 cases in Europe and the U.S. and rising production from Libya, the recovery stalled overnight with focus returning to what support OPEC+ can give at a time of weakening fundamentals.

11402268,2020-11-05,"By reporting a 44.6% decrease in profits in Q3 2020, Aramco has put a major damper on Saudi Arabia's economic diversification strategies and overall stability. Saudi Aramco reported that its Q3 2020 profits decreased to Riyal 44.21 billion ($11.79 billion) from Riyal 79.84 billion ($21.29 billion) in Q3 2019. Worryingly, even those disappointing financials were helped by several royalty changes that boosted profits. The results from OPEC's largest oil producer contradict the optimism being expressed by the oil cartel's leaders in the media. While the results are arguably better than those reported by IOCs such as Shell, BP, Total, and Chevron, they are still very disappointing. The upcoming Q4 results are expected the be even lower. It is now apparent that Saudi Arabia is in serious economic trouble. Looking at this most recent report, it becomes very difficult to justify the optimism expressed by OPEC+ during the last JMCC meeting in Vienna, Austria. Suggestions that there are signs of improvement in the market seem to be largely based on the disputable figures presented by China. When looking at OECD markets, the USA, India, and even the MENA region, there is very little to be hopeful about for OPEC+.

The world's most valuable oil company is clearly fighting an uphill battle as it attempts to control global oil markets while providing Saudi Arabia with a much-needed cash injection. The ongoing market crash and the slump in demand due to the COVID pandemic, which is once again driving large-scale lockdowns across Europe and elsewhere, doesn't bode well for the Oil Kingdom's revenue generator. Looking at current global developments, Q4 and H1 2021 are on course to be as bad as Q3 2020 or possibly even worse. All of that is before taking into consideration a possible election victory for Joe Biden and the re-emergence of oil production from Iran, Libya, and Iraq.

Aramco's CEO Amin Nasser, however, remains optimistic, stating that he sees ""early signs of a recovery in the third quarter due to improved economic activity, despite the headwinds facing global energy markets."" Aramco seems to be backing up its aggressive words with actions, as it maintains its total dividend payments. Nasser stated that ""we maintained our commitment to shareholder value by declaring a dividend of $18.75 billion for the third quarter."" The company's free cash flow, however, was $12.4 billion in the third quarter, falling short of its dividend commitment. The current dividend position is based on Aramco's IPO promise that it will issue $75 billion in dividends annually for five years. If this promise is not kept, the repercussions for Aramco are likely to be very steep. It's important to remember that Aramco is listed on the Saudi stock exchange Tadawul, making up the overwhelming majority of the total listing. The strength of Aramco is the main reason for the share price rally on the exchange. Any doubts about Aramco's future dividend and profitability will not only hit the value of the NOC but directly affect the Tadawul. A share price decline and lower Tadawul could result in a major domestic financial crisis, as Saudi nationals have been betting on share price increases. A hit to the Tadawul is a hit to the entire Saudi economy.

Saudi Aramco's financial strength is a key factor in the overall stability of Saudi Arabia. Without a stable oil and gas sector, Saudi Arabia could be heading towards a crisis. Lower revenues, which can be expected due to lower global demand in the coming months, will heavily impact both Saudi Arabia and the position of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Without generating cash, the country will struggle to maintain its economic diversification efforts, and unemployment, which is already on the rise, will likely spike. While Saudi Arabia's overall hydrocarbon production for Q3 was 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which crude oil made up 9.2 million bpd, there is no guarantee that the Kingdom can retain that level of production. For 2020, Aramco indicated that its total CAPEX is expected to be at the lower end of the $25 billion to $30 billion range for 2020. It is possible that the oil giant will see further delays in new projects or even some cancellations. Observers should keep an eye on Aramco's investments and operations in the Red Sea region, and its flagship Ras Al Khair Shipyard project.

The COVID pandemic, a global recession, and lower crude oil demand are problems that are unlikely to go away any time soon. The market strategy of OPEC+ is clearly failing and some OPEC members such as Libya and Iraq appear determined to increase production volumes. A combination of more oil from Libya and Iraq with the possibility of more Iranian oil coming online after January 2021 would be disastrous for oil markets. Saudi Arabia must face the reality that demand is unlikely to recover any time soon and supply could increase greatly. VLCCs and other maritime offshore storage options are already starting to fill up. NOCs like Aramco will have to cope with the pressure of their own governments, which need higher revenues to counter deficits, but at the same time have to be able to stabilize the global market. At present, those two issues are directly opposed to one another. OPEC+ is a major market force but it is not able to control demand. If low-cost producers such as Saudi Aramco are feeling the pain, then you can be sure the rest of the OPEC+ alliance is also in trouble.

Saudi Arabia's current budget requires an oil price of around $50 per barrel. Mainstream advisors such as Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg are warning of consequences if no measures are taken to restructure the oil giant. Moody's Investors Service has stated that Saudi Arabia cannot afford to rely on annual dividends of almost $75 billion from Aramco after 2021, especially if oil prices remain in the low $40s. Aramco's dividend has, until now, managed to plug the government deficit. But now Aramco needs to find the cash to sure up its falling CAPEX and also to pay for the acquisition of SABIC.

Facing a fiscal gap of more than $11 billion in Q3, the government of Saudi Arabia is massively cash strapped. Indications are that the fiscal gap has increased by 27% in 2020 compared to a year earlier.

Last month, the Saudi government stated that it expects a budget deficit close to 12% of GDP in 2020 and 5.1% of GDP in 2021 before balancing in 2023. This assessment suggests that higher government revenue will come from the high dividend paid to the state by the national oil company, enabling Saudi Arabia to delay large spending cuts. But this may be putting too much reliance on a currently uncertain dividend. Aramco's financial buffers are also eroding. There is also the potential of international rating agencies lowering the overall ratings of Saudi Arabia. With a budget based on $50 per barrel, a crisis seems to be almost unavoidable.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Libya', 'Iraq', 'Vienna', 'United States', 'Iran', 'India', 'China']",Aramco's Profit Drop Is A Dire Warning For Saudi Arabia | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Aramcos-Profit-Drop-Is-A-Dire-Warning-For-Saudi-Arabia.html,None,

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported on Tuesday a major draw in crude oil inventories of 8.01 million barrels for the week ending October 30.

Analysts had predicted an inventory build of 890,000 barrels.

In the previous week, the API reported a surprise build in oil inventories of 4.577-million barrels, after analysts had predicted a draw of 1.11 million barrels.

Oil prices were trading up on Tuesday afternoon before the API's data release in the runup to the U.S. election. Bearish factors this week include a ramp-up of oil production in OPEC producer Libya, the resolution to the latest storm that has disrupted oil and gas production on the U.S. Gulf Coast over the last week, and additional lockdowns in Europe.

In the runup to Tuesday's data release, at 2:07 p.m. EDT, WTI had risen by $0.97 (+2.64%) to $37.77, down roughly $2 per barrel on the week. The Brent crude benchmark had risen on the day by $0.89 at that time (+2.28%) to $39.86 -- down roughly $1.50 on the week.

Oil production in the United States rose last week, closing the gap between production this week and the all-time high this year down to 2.0 million barrels per day. U.S. oil production currently sits at 11.1 million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The API reported a surprise build in gasoline inventories of 2.45-million barrels of gasoline for the week ending October 27 -- compared to the previous week's 2.252-million-barrel build. Analysts had expected an 871,000-barrel draw for the week.

Distillate inventories were down by 577,000 barrels for the week, compared to last week's 5.333-million-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories rose by 981,000 barrels.

The world is holding its breath as American voters head to the polls. The oil market, however, likely won't see much influence on prices either way, at least not immediately. Near-term price movements will be much more influenced by COVID-19 and other market fundamentals. Prices sank over the past week due to renewed lockdown orders in Europe, although crude rebounded rather strongly in early trading on Tuesday on hopes of OPEC+ action.

Oil industry sees opening with Biden. Former Vice President Joe Biden is ahead in the polls, and the oil industry is maneuvering to prepare for more regulation. Biden recently said that he wants to U.S. to transition away from oil, but the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's most powerful lobby, said it would ""seek to engage a Biden transition team."" Two areas of potential opportunities include tax credits for carbon capture technologies, and easing trade tensions with China, which would boost oil and gas exports.

Oil and gas industry hope for continuity. If Biden wins, energy analysts say that there may not be dramatic changes affecting oil and gas drilling. Biden has pledged not to ban fracking, except on new drilling on federal lands, a comparatively small slice of the industry. Other analysts suggest Biden could be bullish for oil prices - federal stimulus and a renewed trade focus could be beneficial. CNBC looks at other areas of potential change or continuity. Meanwhile, if Trump defies the polls and wins reelection, analysts say the industry will see more of the same: deregulation, a push for maximum production, friendly treatment, but uncertainty on trade.

11402271,2020-11-03,"The main oil benchmarks fell below $40 a barrel again this week as clouds gathered over the outlook for demand and supply amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in Europe and the United States. And they might have further to fall. Reuters' John Kemp reported on Tuesday that hedge funds had sold enough oil last week to offset the previous week's purchased that supported prices at around $40 a barrel. But now, the resurgence in Covid-19 is fueling fears of a double-dip recession in two key markets, driving a warier attitude to crude oil.

Rystad Energy, meanwhile, said on Monday that it expected global oil demand to peak in eight years. This was the latest in a string of pessimistic forecasts on oil demand, all of them citing the pandemic as a major factor determining future trends. The forecast is a revision on an earlier one that expected peak oil demand to occur in 2030, with the company citing the rush to a greener energy future as another determining factor.

At the same time, OPEC appears to be divided on the next steps in oil production control. While some members are determined to keep a lid on output to support prices, others are getting impatient to resume production growth. According to a recent Reuters report, citing sources from the cartel and the oil industry, some OPEC members wanted to start producing more oil from January.

""The countries are being suffocated with those cuts, it is very tough to continue with them next year too,"" one of these sources told Reuters.

It is telling that some OPEC members would prefer to pump more and sell the oil at weaker prices than keep the curbs and sell at higher prices. It also suggests that the internal division in OPEC could deepen if prices continue down as Covid-19 cases continue up.

According to Reuters' Kemp, investors and traders don't seem concerned about the OEPC+ cuts. There is optimism there. Yet it is not sufficient to motivate more oil buying because of the demand outlook. The demand outlook, for its part, is tied fast to the pandemic outlook, and that one is pretty pessimistic right now.

This week, of course, one more factor would add to oil market volatility, and it is the U.S. presidential election. A Trump win is likely to be bullish for prices in the short term but perhaps not in the long term because of his support for the oil and gas industry that could mean an increase in production down the road.

A Biden win could be the opposite: negative in the immediate term but bullish for oil in the long term as increased regulation, and a partial ban on fracking would tighten supply, as per Goldman Sachs. On the other hand, Biden could seal a deal with Iran, which would mean more Iranian crude coming into the market.

Analysts, meanwhile, expect oil to continue trading within a range until the end of the year, with Brent averaging $42.32 per barrel for full-2020 and rising to a bit above $49 per barrel in 2021. The only thing that could move benchmarks substantially higher would be some good news from the vaccine development front or a production outage in Libya, which has been ramping up production with lightning speed: the country reported output of 800,000 bpd most recently, from below 100,000 bpd in late September.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Iran', 'Libya']",Why Oil Prices May Be Set To Fall Further | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Why-Oil-Prices-May-Be-Set-To-Fall-Further.html,None,
11402272,2020-11-02,"The top executives of Russia's oil companies discussed on Monday the future of the OPEC+ deal with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, including an option to extend the cuts as-is for three months until March 2021, instead of easing the cuts from January as planned, sources with knowledge of the matter told Russian news agency Interfax.

The OPEC+ group, in which Russia is the leader of the non-OPEC producers, currently plans to taper the 7.7-million-bpd collective cut by 2 million bpd beginning in January 2021. But the second coronavirus wave sweeping across the United States and Europe -- and already prompting the return of lockdowns in major European economies -- is further delaying the global oil demand recovery. In recent weeks, concerns about demand and rising supply from Libya have weighed on oil prices and intensified market speculation that the OPEC+ group may not have a choice but to roll over the current cuts and delay the plans to ease those cuts in January.

Russian oil firms have openly criticized at times the OPEC+ deal in the past because, they argue, it burdens them with production cuts aimed at supporting oil prices, which in turn help U.S. producers to pump more oil.

At the meeting with minister Novak on Monday, the companies discussed several options, as usual in those meetings, Interfax's sources said. The Russian companies supported the baseline option discussed at the meeting -- keeping the terms of the OPEC+ deal as they are now, which means the group relaxing the cuts by 2 million bpd from January 2021, one of Interfax's sources said.

Russian oil firms are against the idea aired recently by some partners in the deal that OPEC+ should even deepen the current cuts in the first quarter next year. Russia's oil companies are not ready and willing to deepen the cuts; the maximum they could agree to would be extending the current production cuts through the first quarter of 2021, a source told Interfax.

Russia's oil firms, however, will not have a final say in Moscow's options in the OPEC+ deal, as the ideas discussed today will also be discussed at a higher level. Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely have the final say.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Russia', 'Libya', 'Moscow']",Russia Discusses Three-Month Extension Of OPEC+ Oil Production Cuts | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russia-Discusses-Three-Month-Extension-Of-OPEC-Oil-Production-Cuts.html,None,
11402273,2020-11-02,"Libya's crude oil production has reached 800,000 bpd, Reuters has reported, citing sources in the know. This is a 100,000-bpd increase in just a few days, the report added.

Libya started ramping up oil production in late September when the Libyan national Army agreed to a ceasefire with the Government of National Accord and lifted its blockade from oil facilities.

During the more than eight months of the blockade, Libya's oil output slumped from over 1 million bpd to less than 100,000 bpd. Since the lifting of the blockade, however, the National Oil Corporation has been restoring production in leaps and bounds.

Within a month, production rebounded to 500,000 bpd, with the largest field in Libya, Sharara, restarting in October. Now, NOC seems to be on track to reach its stated target of 1 million bpd before the end of the year. This flies in the face of expectations that it would take the North African country several months to restore its oil production and has pressured oil prices significantly.

Meanwhile, Libya's finance minister has put a price on the oil terminal blockades that have plagued the industry for years after the official end of the civil war. This price is $130 billion in lost revenues, according to Faraj Boumtari.

The most recent blockade in Libya, between January and the middle of September, has cost the country almost $10 billion, the National Oil Corporation said, describing it as ""a devastating loss most especially during this period of national crisis.""

Not everyone is confident that the rebound will last, however. As Cyril Widdershoven pointed out in a recent analysis for Oilprice, the political situation in the country remains highly volatile, which makes more blockades and production outages very likely based on recent history. The most recent news in this respect came from Tripoli: the Prime Minister of the GNA cabinet, Fayez al-Serraj, had withdrawn his resignation, remaining at his post until a replacement is found as negotiations with the LNA about the future organization of power in Libya continue.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli']","Libya Oil Output Hits 800,000 Bpd | OilPrice.com",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libya-Oil-Output-Hits-800000-Bpd.html,None,

The current price action indicates that chart-watchers are recognizing the importance of a key 50% to 61.8% retracement zone of the entire late-April to late-August rally.

Does this week's price action mean the selling is out of control? No. All we can surmise is that the fundamentals have worsened enough since about August 26 to take away about half of the entire rally from April.

Since that high was reached, we've seen U.S. stimulus funds evaporate as fiscal coronavirus aid expire, the end of the U.S. driving season, increased U.S. production, a failure to pass new fiscal stimulus legislation, increased production from Libya, OPEC+'s plan to continue to reduce its production cuts and a resurgence of the coronavirus in the United States, Europe, and Russia.

Given all that bearish news, traders really had no choice but to liquidate longs or go short since nearly all of the reasons to stay long had evaporated.

11402275,2020-10-30,"Crude oil collapsed earlier this week after France and Germany announced new lockdowns in response to surging Covid-19 cases, and now it is set for its worst month since late spring.

Cases are also on a fast rise in the United States as well, threatening to overwhelm some states' healthcare systems. This, combined with the fact that a new stimulus bill is highly unlikely to be agreed before next week's election, pressured West Texas Intermediate to some $35 a barrel, the lowest since April when prices took a nosedive on the first round of national lockdowns.

Those, apparently, did not work as hoped for, and although they proved to take a severe toll on economies, fears are rising that more countries could follow in the footsteps of France and Germany. This has understandably darkened the outlook on oil demand and pressured already crippled prices.

Meanwhile, some members of OPEC appear to be reluctant to extend the production cuts that were supposed to be relaxed by some 2 million bpd beginning this January. According to a report citing sources from the cartel and the oil industry, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait -- OPEC's numbers two, three, and four, respectively -- were not realty on board with another extension of deep cuts. That level of production, the source told Reuters, could not sustain their economies.

Currently, OPEC+ is enforcing production cuts of 7.7 million bpd, distributed proportionately among members of the group. This means that Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait are among those with the deepest cuts. And while Saudi Arabia and Russia have signaled they would be willing to extend these cuts for another three months, this is not the case with the other three.

Libya, meanwhile, has reached a production level of 680,000 bpd and is ramping it up further, eyeing 1 million bpd in a month. The country is exempt from the OPEC+ cuts agreement.

To top it all off, the possibility of a Biden win in next week's vote is also a possibility for a new deal with Iran and an end to sanctions. This would mean more oil coming into the market.

According to 41 analysts and economists surveyed by Reuters, the second wave of coronavirus cases in major economies will further delay the economic and oil demand recovery, while growing supply out of Libya will also weigh on prices.

The only factors that could take oil out of range-bound trade for the rest of the year are the U.S. presidential election next week, and some very good news about a vaccine, Raiffeisen analyst David Olzant told Reuters.

The election next week is set to increase volatility in all markets, including the oil market. A Joe Biden win on November 3 could be positive for oil prices in the long run because more regulations and a ban on new leases on federal lands could lead to a decline in U.S. oil production, Goldman Sachs said earlier this month. But a President Biden could also pave the way to the U.S. returning to the Iran nuclear deal with potential sanctions relief. A return of Iranian oil supply would be bearish for oil prices.

In the shorter term, concerns about demand in the second pandemic wave are the biggest factor for oil prices, according to analysts, and those polled by Reuters do not expect that prices will rise too much until demand is firmly on the track to recovery.

The analysts expect Brent crude prices to average $42.32 per barrel this year, slightly down from the $42.48 projection in last month's poll and almost in line with the average price of $42.45 so far in 2020. Next year, the analysts polled by Reuters expect Brent prices to average $49.76 per barrel, down compared to $50.41 expected a month ago.

WTI Crude prices are seen averaging $38.53 per barrel this year, slightly down from $38.70 a barrel expected last month.

Oil prices extended their 5-percent slump from Wednesday into Thursday morning, plunging by another 5 percent, with WTI Crude sliding to $35 a barrel, as major economies in Europe renewed lockdowns to fight the second wave of the coronavirus.

As of 10:07 a.m. EDT on Thursday, WTI Crude was plunging by 5.27 percent at $35.11, and Brent Crude was plummeting by 4.98 percent at $36.89. The U.S. benchmark slid to its lowest level since June, while the international crude benchmark Brent dropped below $37 a barrel to its lowest price since May this year.

The sell-off in oil intensified this week with market sentiment souring by the day since the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported on Tuesday a bigger build than expected in crude oil inventories of 4.577 million barrels for the week ending October 23. The build was confirmed on Wednesday by the EIA, and oil prices dived 5 percent on concerns about oil demand with surging COVID-19 cases. Brent prices had already slid below the $40 a barrel mark on Wednesday, and on Thursday, the rout extended with Brent prices slipping to $36 -- the lowest level since the middle of May.

Oil market participants are concerned that the return of lockdowns in Europe will significantly weigh on economic recovery and fuel demand. Two of the largest economies in Europe, Germany, and France, announced lockdowns, which the market was not expecting two or three weeks ago. Industry professionals and executives did not believe that countries would resort again to nationwide lockdowns. Yet, France did, and as of Friday, people will be allowed to go out only for shopping for essential items, for medical reasons, or for an hour-long exercise. The measure will last until the end of November, French President Emmanuel Macron said.

Germany, the biggest economy in Europe, is also restoring a form of lockdown, although a partial one, for the month of November, restricting social gatherings and closing bars and restaurants except for takeaway.

Both crude benchmarks ""slumped to the bottom of their respective ranges with surging virus cases in Europe and the U.S. as well as a bigger-than-expected jump in U.S. crude stockpiles taking its toll on the market.

For most of the period through August, Russia was part of the OPEC+ agreement to curtail supply to the market, except in March and early April, when Russia and Saudi Arabia disagreed on how to manage oil supply to the market when demand was crashing due to the pandemic. The current production cuts began in May 2020 and are much deeper than in the previous deal.

Russia's crude oil exports also dropped in terms of value due to the slump in oil prices. Between January and August, the value of Russian crude oil exports plunged by 38.9 percent compared to the same period last year, to US$48.8 billion, according to data from the Russian federal customs service.

Currently, Russia's economy is suffering the consequences of the oil price crash that it helped create with the temporary rift with its OPEC+ partner Saudi Arabia. Russia's oil income shrank as a result of the plunge in oil prices.

Due to the restrictions under the OPEC+ deal, Russia plans to export 16.4 percent less crude oil this year compared to 2019, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at the budget committee at Russia's Parliament last week.

Crude oil production is expected to drop by 10 percent in 2020 from 2019, Novak said, adding that output could return to the levels before the pandemic by 2023, but this would depend on global oil demand and the OPEC+ agreements.

OPEC+ is set to ease the current cuts by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) as of January, but weak demand and rising supply from exempt OPEC member Libya could derail those plans.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week he is not ruling out OPEC+ delaying the easing of the cuts, or even making further reductions.

""We are of the opinion that nothing needs to change right now. However, we are not ruling out either maintaining existing production limits or not lifting them as soon as we had intended earlier.

OPEC and its Russia-led partners will likely consider ""a lot of demand issues"" before tapering their cuts, he said in an interview with Gulf Intelligence. OPEC+'s decision will depend on how economies recover, including the U.S. economy from a potential stimulus, Al-Buainain added.

The OPEC+ group is set to relax the current collective cut of 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to 5.8 million bpd beginning in January next year. However, the second COVID-19 wave in Europe and the United States is threatening economic and demand recovery and has increased market talk and speculation that OPEC+ may not and/or should not increase oil supply at the start of next year.

Currently, the only bright spot in demand is China, which is expected to sustain solid demand in the fourth quarter and into the start of 2021, Aramco Trading's Al-Buainain told Gulf Intelligence.

While demand in China is holding up and is back to nearly normal levels, demand in the developed economies in Europe and in the United States doesn't look so bright at all, due to the spike in new coronavirus cases. The second wave is a threat to demand and is delaying the recovery from the slump in the second quarter, oil industry executives and OPEC itself have warned recently.

The API also reported a surprise build in gasoline inventories of 2.252 million barrels for the week ending October 23 -- compared to the previous week's 1.622-million-barrel draw. Analysts had expected a 2.0-million-barrel draw for the week.

If confirmed by the EIA later on Wednesday, another gasoline build could point to further weakening in U.S. gasoline demand. For the previous week, the EIA reported the largest gasoline draw since June, even as refineries cut utilization rates and gasoline production for the week to October 16.

The bearish signals drove down oil prices lower late on Tuesday and into Wednesday, even though oil producers in the Gulf of Mexico continued to shut in production ahead of Hurricane Zeta. As of late on Tuesday, as much as 49.45 percent of the oil production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was shut-in, according to data from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).

This compares with a decline of 1 million barrels for the previous week, which helped prop up prices for a short while before concerns about demand prevailed once again amid surging Covid-19 cases in Europe and the United States.

At 492.4 million barrels, crude oil inventories are 9 percent above the five-year average for this time of the year, when demand declines for seasonal reasons, so more builds are to be expected.

Yet the biggest factor contributing to inventory movements right now remains the coronavirus, which is again infecting record numbers of people in the United States: the seven-day average of newly diagnosed cases for last week hit 70,000.

Against this worrying background, the EIA also reported a surprising inventory decline in gasoline inventories for the reporting period. At 900,000 barrels, the decline compared with an increase of 1.9 million barrels for the prior week.

Gasoline production last week averaged 9.1 million bpd, which compared with 8.9 million bpd a week earlier.

Distillate fuel inventories shed 4.5 million barrels in the week to October 23. This compares with a draw of 3.8 million barrels for the previous week. That draw followed an even heftier one for the first week of October in a rare good sign about distillate fuels.

Distillate fuel production last week averaged 4.1 million bpd, which was almost unchanged on the previous week.

Oil prices were trading up on Tuesday afternoon before the API's data release, despite the depressed demand outlook that persists in the market. Bearish factors this week include a ramp-up of oil production in OPEC producer Libya. Bullish factors include another storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast that is shutting down oil production. The increase in the number of new Covid-19 cases serves as a chronic bearish undertone in the market.

11402285,2020-10-26,"Portfolio managers increased their bullish bets on crude oil futures and options in the week to October 20 by the most since April, according to the latest commitment of traders report with data from exchanges.

The jump in longs in Brent Crude and WTI Crude coincided with increased market speculation earlier this month that OPEC+ would likely postpone the easing of the ongoing production cuts until global oil demand strengthens, Reuters columnist John Kemp commented on Monday.

In the week to October 20, money managers bought the equivalent of 55 million barrels of oil in the six most important petroleum contracts, with the buying focused heavily on WTI Crude and Brent Crude, according to Kemp's estimates from the commitment of traders (COT) report.

The buying in the crude contracts was not only short covering but also establishing new long positions, the report showed.

The overall net long position -- the difference between bullish and bearish bets -- in crude futures and options has now jumped to the equivalent of 464 million barrels, up from a low of 380 million at the beginning of the month, Reuters' Kemp noted.

According to estimates from ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao, the increased bullish bets in Brent futures and options was mostly the result of fresh buying, while the rise in long positions in WTI was driven fairly evenly by both fresh buying and short covering.

""Speculators added the most crude oil length since April with the combine net long in Brent and WTI crude oil rising by 58,453 lots to 472,390 lots, a seven-week high,"" Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Monday.

""The increase occurred during a week where prices recovered back to the top of their established ranges before trading lower again on a surprise U.S. stock build and continued concerns about the pandemics impact on fuel demand at a time of rising production from Libya, now forecast to reach 1 million barrels/day within weeks,"" Hansen added.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Libya']",Hedge Funds Boost Bullish Oil Bets | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Hedge-Funds-Boost-Bullish-Oil-Bets.html,None,

""We remain cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue. It may take longer, maybe at lower levels, but we are determined to stay the course,"" OPEC's chief said.

The market is increasingly concerned about the pace of demand recovery as the second coronavirus wave is sweeping through the U.S. and Europe. Additional supply out of Libya and the OPEC+ plan to ease the cuts by another 2 million barrels per day (bpd) as of January 2021 have put more pressure on oil prices in recent weeks.

""We are determined to assist the market to restore stability by ensuring that the stock drawdowns continue in order to restore the supply-demand balance,"" OPEC's Barkindo said today, while speculation is growing whether the group would delay the easing of the cuts by several months until global oil demand shows positive trends.

Earlier this month, Barkindo sought to assure the oil market that the OPEC+ group would look to ensure that prices do not plummet again as they did in the spring. Keeping market stability is the top priority of the OPEC+ agreement, but ""We have no illusions this recovery will take a long time,"" Barkindo said on the Energy Intelligence Forum.

The UN-led mediation by the 5+5 Joint Military Commission, representing the UN-recognized Government in Tripoli and the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) of General Khalifa Haftar, agreed to a ceasefire, which UN Acting Special Representative, Stephanie Williams, said could help secure ""a better, safer, and more peaceful future for all the Libyan people.""

According to Williams, all foreign fighters and mercenaries in Libya should leave the country within three months. In addition, there were ""good indications that the oil installations of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider will be ready to resume production in the near future, in a very short period of time,"" Williams said at a news conference, as carried by Reuters.

Haftar, whose troops, with help from affiliated groups, had blockaded Libya's oil ports in January, announced the end of the blockade on September 18.

Since then, NOC has gradually lifted force majeure on some of the oil terminals and oilfields, and Libya's crude oil production has increased over the past month from below 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) during the blockade to as much as 500,000 bpd last week.

Earlier this month, NOC announced that it had lifted the force majeure on the largest Libyan oilfield, Sharara, which has the capacity to produce more than 300,000 bpd. As of last week, Sharara was pumping around 100,000 bpd and has further increased output to some 150,000 bpd early this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.

The return of Libyan oil to the market has weighed on oil prices in recent weeks, and even the OPEC+ group is closely monitoring the supply increase from the country.

11402289,2020-10-23,"- ISIS is calling on its supporters to attack Westerners and oil pipelines and economic infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, based on a recorded message carried by the media but otherwise not confirmed as authentic. In the message, alleged ISIS spokesman Abu Hamza Al-Muhajir urges the targeting of Westerners in Saudi Arabia and attacks against the Kingdom's economic infrastructure because of its support for the normalization of relations between Gulf countries and Israel. This is an attempt by forces (likely beyond ISIS) to ensure that Saudi Arabia does not openly follow the UAE's move to officially and publicly normalize with Israel.

- In relation to that, Israeli state-owned pipeline company Europe Asia Pipeline Company (EAPC) has signed an MOU to store and transport oil and distillates from the UAE to Europe. Under the agreement between EAPC and MED-RED, a company with both Israeli and Emirati owners, a land bridge will be established between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, enabling a massive increase in the volume of oil that can be transported annually.

- The US has officially expanded sanctions on companies involved in building that last bit of the Russian-led NordStream2 pipeline. The expanded sanctions target companies providing series or facilities for upgrades or installation of equipment for those vessels, as well as funding for such initiatives.

- An official ceasefire has been declared in Libya, with two Libyan delegations on Friday signing the makings of a permanent ceasefire. Both sides in the dispute will evacuate fighters from the frontlines, and both will require their foreign mercs to leave the country within three months. In perhaps an even bigger show of solidarity, the two sides will create a joint military force under a single command, which will police any ceasefire violations.

- Sinopec has broken the directional drilling record in Asia--at 8,874 meters--in its Shunbei oil and gas field. The field is the deepest onshore oil and gas field in Asia. Shunbei is known for its ultra-deep wells (it has almost 40 of them), and boasts production of 1 million tonnes of crude and 400 million cubic meters of natural gas each year. It is aiming to increase its oil output to 1,7 million tonnes within five years.

Regulations and Legislation

- Alberta is handing out a generous three-year tax break on municipal property taxes for oil and gas companies for property on which they are drilling wells or building pipelines. The province will also lower property tax assessments on property that has less-productive wells and will discontinue the provincial tax on drills. For Alberta's industry, it will mean a total tax break of about $61 million in the first year for the industry. The breaks will start in 2022.

- Norway's Supreme Court is set to decide on November 4th whether the country can explore for Arctic Oil. The court will determine if the court has the ability to tell the government to stop issuing licenses for more oil exploration.

11402290,2020-10-23,"The frequent oil blockades in Libya over the past few years have cost the country a total of US$130 billion in lost revenues, Finance Minister Faraj Boumtari told Al-Jazeera on Thursday.

Libya's oil industry has been plagued by on-and-off blockades as rival factions have been fighting for control over areas in Libya and its oil terminals and ports since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The most recent blockade in Libya, between January and the middle of September, has cost Libya almost US$10 billion, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said, describing it as ""a devastating loss most especially during this period of national crisis.""

The head of the Libyan National Army (LNA), General Khalifa Haftar, whose troops, with help from affiliated groups, had blockaded Libya's oil ports in January, announced the end of the blockade on September 18.

NOC started to gradually lift force majeure on some of the oil terminals and oilfields, and Libya's crude oil production has increased over the past month from below 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) before the blockade was lifted to as much as 500,000 bpd last week.

11402291,2020-10-22,"U.S. gasoline demand is weakening, prompting refineries to additionally cut capacity utilization and crude processing in a sign that resurging coronavirus cases are derailing fuel demand recovery.

According to this week's petroleum inventory report from the EIA, gasoline stocks in the United States increased by 1.9 million barrels for the week to October 16. Gasoline production last week averaged 8.9 million bpd, compared with 9.2 million bpd a week earlier.

U.S. refinery runs averaged 13 million barrels daily, compared with 13.6 million bpd a week earlier, operating at 72.9 percent of capacity, versus 75.1 percent of capacity during the previous week.

The level of gasoline supplied in the U.S. has now declined to 9 percent below the previous five-year average, compared to 4 percent below the five-year average at the beginning of October, according to estimates from Reuters columnist John Kemp.

The lower gasoline production and the jump in U.S. gasoline inventories point to falling gasoline demand in the country this month.

The jump in gasoline inventories and the renewed concern that U.S. demand is now falling sent oil prices down by 4 percent on Wednesday, with WTI Crude breaking below the $40 a barrel mark.

Some of the rise in gasoline inventories could be attributed to Hurricane Delta, but ""the market overall remains troubled by a resurgent coronavirus raising concerns about demand, as mobility is being restricted, at a time of rising supply from Libya and a potential but now doubtful increase from OPEC+ from January,"" John Hardy, Head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Thursday.

11402292,2020-10-21,"The world's largest oil importer, China, will continue to have a significant impact on the oil market in the coming months, as most of the rest of the world continues to battle a second coronavirus wave that has stalled the already fragile global oil demand recovery.

China is likely importing now the last of the cheap crude its refiners snapped up in the spring when it took advantage of the lowest crude oil prices in nearly two decades.

With the last of the delayed cargoes likely to discharge and clear customs in October, the market now looks with apprehension at signs about China's oil-importing policies for the rest of the year, seeking signs of how much the 'normal levels' of crude imports could be.

That's one of the known unknowns for the oil market and oil prices going forward, alongside some volatility in prices around the U.S. presidential election in two weeks.

China's crude oil imports were strong in Q2 and Q3 this year, while the rest of the world went through a fragile demand recovery only to see it flatten at the end of the summer as COVID-19 infections started to rise again in major oil consumers, including in the United States, Europe, and Asia excluding China.

Customs import data from the world's top oil importer continue to show strong arrivals of crude as ports and customs continue to process cargoes that have waited for weeks to discharge. But as the remainder of the backlogged cargoes clears customs this month, Chinese oil imports for the rest of the year are expected to drop off the high volumes seen between April and September, analysts say.

Falling Chinese imports compared to Q2 and Q3 will not be unexpected, considering that oil prices are now double the level of around $20 a barrel in April. The question for the market and analysts now is how much China's normalized import rates will be after the buying binge earlier this year.

Much lower Q4 import volumes than in the previous two quarters will send a negative signal to the market at a time when economic recovery and, by extension, oil demand recovery elsewhere is weaker than in the summer and weaker than everyone had predicted three months ago.

Over the past five months through September, China's crude oil imports haven't fallen below 11 million barrels per day (bpd), with June arrivals of 12.9 million bpd smashing the previous record from May by more than 1.5 million bpd.

In September, China likely increased its crude stockpiling compared to August, according to estimates from Reuters columnist Clyde Russell, based on official data for oil imports plus domestic production, less refinery processing rates. China probably sent around 1.75 million bpd into storage last month, up from 1.1 million bpd in August.

China's rate of stockpiling crude oil this year has been much higher than in 2019 due to the ultra-low prices in the spring, expansion of storage sites, and the policy to ensure energy security. It's likely, therefore, that Chinese refiners have a lot of crude around and may opt to process part of the oil stashed in recent months than keeping purchases very high. Fuel demand in the rest of Asia is still sluggish, which couldn't be much of an incentive for Chinese refiners to process high volumes of crude into fuel for exports.

China's crude oil imports in Q4 could drop by between 1.2 million bpd and 1.7 million bpd compared to Q3 import levels, analysts told Reuters last week.

A large decline in China's crude oil imports is the last thing oil bulls (and OPEC) need in the last quarter of the year, while fears of stalled demand are front and center together with rising supply from Libya and recovering drilling activity in the United States.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['China', 'United States', 'Libya']",China's Crude Imports Become Backbone Of Oil Price Recovery | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Chinas-Crude-Imports-Become-Backbone-Of-Oil-Price-Recovery.html,None,
11402293,2020-10-06,"In 2019, Scottish politician Michael Ancram, Marquess of Lothian, requested of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) the information they held on the installation plans of Russian military bases in Africa, particularly in Zimbabwe. There was concern that Moscow's influence might collide with London's. Another major actor in Africa, Paris, became alarmed in 2018 as Russian Wagner and GRU security consultants started to appear in political circles in countries such as the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Libya alongside Khalifa Haftar's troops. In Libya, Russian security forces reportedly suffered heavy losses in the battle for Tripoli.

Part of Russia's engagement with Africa is military. The Russian army and Russian private military contractors linked to the Kremlin have expanded their global military footprint in Africa, seeking basing rights in a half dozen countries and inking military cooperation agreements with 28 African governments, according to an analysis by the Institute for the Study of War. U.S. officials estimate that around 400 Russian mercenaries operating in the Central African Republic (CAR), and Moscow recently delivered military equipment to support counterinsurgency operations in northern Mozambique. Russia is the largest arms exporter to Africa, accounting for 39 percent of arms transfers to the region in 2013-2017.

The fact that the Russian ambassador to Mali, Igor Gromyko, was one of the first officials to be received by the Junta is thus unsurprising. Local media source aBamako.com reports that the military leaders of the coup had just spent a year training in Russia. While this kind of activity is not extraordinary, with countries such as the U.S. training armies from more than 20 African countries and shaping its military leaders, it indicates that Russia considers its security presence in Africa necessary. The coup is a blow to French diplomacy, as Paris had heavily invested in Mali security through a tight alliance with former Mali President, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. Keita's time in office, which began in 2013 after a coup in 2012 ousted Amadou Toumani Toure, coincided with a French peacekeeping mission, and the Kremlin may seek to supplant France in West African countries where Paris has a stronghold and influence. Russia could also leverage the Mali coup to secure economic deals while bolstering its geopolitical standing in West Africa.

According to FPRI, Russian nuclear energy giant Rosatom, which directly competes with its French counterpart for contracts in the Sahel, could benefit from favorable relations with Mali's new political authorities. Nordgold, a Russian gold company that has investments in Guinea and Burkina Faso, could also expand its extraction initiatives in Mali's gold reserves.

However, Professor Irina Filatova, Research Professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, who specializes in Russian Foreign Policy, insists on caution about assuming Russian interference in Malian politics:

""It's difficult for me to judge how reliable this information is because Moscow has said nothing about it.""

Indeed, even though Russia has been a long term partner with Mali since Mali's independence from France in the 1960s, no significant diplomatic agreement has recently been passed, outside of weapons trade. Moreover, the shift in the Junta's alliance from France to Russia might also be related to distrust of its more traditional allies, with France unable to stabilize Mali so far. To take further advantage of the coup in Mali, Russia has positioned itself as a counterinsurgency partner for countries in the region.

In a September 9 interview with Sputnik, Cote d'Ivoire's Ambassador to Russia Roger Gnango called for increased military cooperation with Russia, due to instability resulting from the Mali coup.

Russia's growing involvement in Africa can also be explained by its vital need to establish new commercial roads and diplomatic alliances after the Crimea-related Western sanctions imposed on Moscow in 2014. According to CSIS, an American think tank, Moscow recently tripled its trade with Africa, from $6.6 billion in 2010 to $18.9 billion in 2018. Russia also broadened its economic strengths beyond arms sales, adding investment in oil, gas, and enhancing nuclear power across the continent, while also importing extractives, such as diamonds in CAR, bauxite in Guinea, and platinum in Zimbabwe.

Politically, Russia has been aiming to build new alliances and make new friends, both to rebuild its image as a world power and decreasing Western influence in a region where socialism has often been part of the political culture of independence leaders. This policy has already borne fruit, with Russia persuading in 2014 more than half of the African governments to oppose or abstain from a UN General Assembly Resolution condemning the annexation of Crimea. Russia signed deals with regional bodies, such as the Southern African Development Community, and fortified its multilateral relationship with African leaders through the organization of Russian-African Summits. Central African Republic officials have summed up the core of these new alliances: ""We presented our problem and Russia offered to help us.""

Most African leaders have taken into account the advantages of aligning with Moscow to pursue political, security, and economic objectives. It allows them to have a more considerable margin of maneuver against international rules, by playing U.S. and Russia against each other; if Washington presses too hard on democracy and human rights-related topics, African nations can threaten to increase their relationship with Moscow and favor more east-centered commercial relations.

However, the influence of Russia, which relies on its security expertise and the use of the Wagner contractors group in conflicts, presents a risk to the stability of Africa as a whole. Moscow may try to rely on the toppling of reluctant governments to advance its diplomatic agenda, which may have been the case in Mali.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Paris', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'Mali', 'Libya', 'France', 'Central African Republic', 'London', 'Scotland', 'Zimbabwe', 'United States', 'Tripoli', 'Sudan', 'Mozambique', 'Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo']",Russia Is Expanding Its Energy Influence In Africa | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Russia-Is-Expanding-Its-Energy-Influence-In-Africa.html,None,

After six months of port blockades and no exports, Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Friday that it lifted force majeure on all oil exports from Libya.

NOC placed the oil terminals at Hariga, Brega, Zueitina, Es Sider, and Ras Lanuf under force majeure at the beginning of this year, after forces affiliated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern Libyan strongman General Khalifa Haftar occupied Libya's oil export terminals and oilfields.

As a result of the blockade, oil production in Libya plummeted to just 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared to 1.2 million bpd before the blockade.

However, just two days after lifting the force majeure, NOC declared force majeure again, citing a renewed blockade on its oil export terminals and blaming it on interference from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

""This is gravely disappointing, especially following repeated statements by very senior representatives of the UAE last week in support of international efforts to restart oil production in Libya. Wagner and Syrian mercenaries now occupy Es Sider oil port and Wagner and Sudanese mercenaries are camped within the vicinity of the Sharara oil field, preventing Libyan oil from flowing,"" NOC said on Sunday.

The U.S. Embassy in Libya said it ""regrets foreign interference against Libya's economy.""

""The door remains open for all who lay down weapons, reject foreign manipulation, and come together in peaceful dialogue to be a part of the solution; however, those who undermine Libya's economy and cling to military escalation will face isolation and risk of sanctions,"" the U.S. Embassy said.

On Monday, the UAE's foreign minister Anwar Gargash said on Twitter:

The blockade at the ports lasted for more than six months, but parties were negotiating - and apparently reached - an agreement, for the re-opening of the oil terminals and the restart of oil production, which had plummeted to just 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared to 1.2 million bpd before the blockade.

Last Friday, NOC lifted the blockade, possibly sparking concern among fellow OPEC members that more supply would be coming online.

""We are very glad finally to be able to take this important step to national recovery, and I wish to thank all the parties to recent discussions for helping to bring about this successful outcome,"" NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement.

11402725,2020-10-16,"Libya's oil production has jumped to around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) this week after the country's largest oilfield resumed pumping crude over the weekend, sources with knowledge of the operations told Bloomberg on Friday.

The return of Libyan oil to the market has weighed on oil prices in recent weeks, after the head of the Libyan National Army (LNA), General Khalifa Haftar -- whose troops, with help from affiliated groups, had blockaded Libya's oil ports in January -- announced the end of the port blockades on September 18.

Even the OPEC+ group is closely monitoring the supply increase from Libya, which is exempted from the production cuts and could derail the alliance's efforts to prop up oil prices and the plans to have the ongoing cuts eased by another 2 million bpd as of January.

Libya's production was already exceeding 300,000 bpd last week, before the National Oil Corporation (NOC) announced this past weekend that it had lifted the force majeure on the largest Libyan oilfield, Sharara, after reaching an agreement with the Petroleum Facilities Guard to ""end the entire obstacles that face Al Sharara Field in a way that guarantees there will be no security breaches and in a way that enables the National Oil Corporation to lift the force majeure status and resume production in Al Sharara Oil Field.""

According to Bloomberg's sources, Sharara -- whose production capacity exceeds 300,000 bpd -- currently pumps around 110,000 bpd.

According to tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg, Libya's oil exports have picked up the pace this month and have so far averaged 385,000 bpd. This compares to 213,000 bpd exported in September. Since the lifting of the blockade in the middle of September, most of Libya's exports have come from the full storage tanks at ports, not from crude oil that has been just pumped.

Production at the 70,000-bpd El Feel oilfield, which is linked to Sharara and typically follows closely the biggest field in reopening, is also set to restart soon, Bloomberg's sources say.",OilPrice.com,energy,,['Libya'],"Libya's Oil Production Jumps To 500,000 Bpd After Biggest Field Restarts | OilPrice.com",https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyas-Oil-Production-Jumps-To-500000-Bpd-After-Biggest-Field-Restarts.html,None,

Libya is currently producing about 300,000 bpd and Sharara could add up to 200,000 bpd more after the lifting of an oil port blockade by the eastern-affiliated Libyan National Army. From below 100,000 bpd, oil output reached close to 300,000 bpd in a matter of two weeks. And plans are to continue ramping up: the governor of Libya's central bank has called on the industry to raise oil production to 1.7 million bpd, which would be more than the country produced before the oil port blockade - 1.2 million bpd.

The National Oil Corporation, which has been saying for months the blockade is costing Libya billions in lost oil revenues, earlier this month reported it had booked in July the smallest monthly revenue this year. At $38.2 million, the July figure was down from $2.1 billion a year earlier. In August, the NOC said, revenues improved thanks to a temporary lifting of the force majeure it had imposed on exports for the duration of the blockade, to $90 billion. This was down from $2 billion for August 2019.

Libya's production ramp-up plan fly straight in the face of OPEC's plan to continue keeping a lid on production amid still sluggish demand improvement and persistently low oil prices. In fact, following Libya's production increase, reports have emerged that Saudi Arabia was mulling over cancelling a planned relaxation of the cuts by about 2 million bpd from January next year. The relaxation is part of the April agreement between OPEC+ members but that agreement probably factored in higher prices as a result of the deep cuts so far this year.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Saudi Arabia']",Libya Restarts Oil Production At Its Largest Oilfield | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libya-Restarts-Oil-Production-At-Its-Largest-Oilfield.html,None,

At 11:06 a.m. EDT, the price of the WTI benchmark had risen by 6.15% to $39.33. While the gains are substantial for the day, they are still under the $40 per barrel mark, and still under where prices were just a week ago, as both major benchmarks stumbled on Friday as reports came in that President Trump had tested positive.

But by Monday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows suggested that the President was improving, and was ready to return to work as usual. Meadows also indicated that President Trump could return to the White House later today. The U.S. President also took a few moments out of his hospital sequestration on Sunday to appear in a motorcade to wave to his supporters.

While Trump took criticism for his brash move on Sunday, his appearance instilled confidence in the markets.

The Brent crude benchmark was trading up 5.65%, at $41.49.

Prices were also supported by strike action in Norway that shut down six offshore oil and gas fields on Monday, including four of Equinor's. More oil and gas field shutdowns are possible in Norway as the strike continues to escalate over pay.

The strike, while painful for Norway, is a welcomed addition to the oil markets who are grappling with low demand and increasing supply out of Libya. Production has ramped up in Libya to almost double following a lifting of the months-long blockade.

11402728,2020-08-31,"Two tankers will be the first since January this year to load oil for export at the Libyan port of Brega, Bloomberg reports, citing unidentified source in the know.

One of the cargos, of 600,000 barrels of crude, will be shipped to Austrian OMV. The other is of a similar size but its destination has not been disclosed.

Libya's oil ports have been frozen by a blockade since January, when groups affiliated with the Libyan National Army of General Khalifa Haftar took over, suspending all exports and, as a result, most of the country's oil production. The National Oil Corporation declared force majeure on oil exports following the blockade while the LNA led an offensive against Tripoli and the Government of National Accord. This force majeure has cost it billions in lost oil revenues.

Earlier this month, the GNA announced a ceasefire and if it holds, more oil might start leaving the war-torn North African country. Even though Libya's production has been decimated, plunging from over 1.2 million bpd to less than 100,000 bpd, there is a lot of oil in storage at the oil ports.

While any news of the reopening of ports is good for Libya, it is not that good for the global oil market. Libya's production deterioration has been positive for prices as OPEC+ fought oversupply with severe production cuts. Indeed, according to Rystad Energy, Libya's oil port blockade could help shrink the global oversupply by as much as 65 percent this year.

Yet for Libya, the blockade has been anything but positive. NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla has recently said that ""The illegal oil blockade has had disastrous effects on our national economy and damaged the living standards of Libyans. Our reservoirs are suffering permanent damage, and stagnant fluids are corroding our pipelines, which will cost us huge amounts to repair.""",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Brega', 'Tripoli', 'Austria']",Libya Set To Export First Crude From Oil Ports Since January | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libya-Set-To-Export-First-Crude-From-Oil-Ports-Since-January.html,None,
11402729,2020-07-07,"Libya's oil production that has dropped sharply in recent months is set to nearly halve in the coming years thanks to an oil blockade that has been in force since January.

Libya's production has dropped from 1.186 million bpd last November to 796,000 bpd by January 2020, before slipping to 82,000 bpd in June, according to OPEC's Monthly Oil Market Report.

Libya had planned to increase production to 2.1 million bpd by 2024, but those plans are now in jeopardy due to recent skirmishes that have embroiled the country's oil facilities and wealth into a pawn in the skirmish between General Haftar's Libyan National Army, which controls the oil, and the Turkish-backed Government of National Accord, which controls the oil revenues.

""We now estimate production will decline to 650,000 b/d in 2022, in the absence of an immediate restart of oil production and because of the state's failure to provide the requested budgets to address the many challenges resulting from the blockade,"" Libya's National Oil Corporation said on its website on Tuesday, adding that some of the damage it has suffered ""is permanent and can never be repaired.""

Oil reservoirs that are shutdown suddenly, according to NOC, ""undergo mechanical, structural, chemical and even microbiological changes. These changes can result in early water production and death of oil wells."" It can also cause bacteria to grow, which can actually change the characteristics of the oil.

NOC is calling for an immediate end to the blockade.

One of the leaders, Ahmed Idris al-Senussi, said in a statement that the terminals were reopened and that his and other leaders' groups had given LNA's leader, General Khalifa Haftar, a mandate to renegotiate the restart of oil production at fields shut down because of the blockade.

A spokesman for Haftar said the LNA welcomed ""any popular mandate to protect oil installations.""

A group of tribes and paramilitary groups occupied Libya's oil export terminals in mid-January as LNA's Haftar launched an offensive against the UN-recognized government pledging that the country would soon have a single government. The LNA is affiliated with the eastern Libyan government.

Soon after the blockade, NOC declared force majeure on oil exports, with Sanalla warning that the blockade could end up costing Libya $55 million daily. At the time, the losses in production were estimated at between 500,000 bpd and 800,000 bpd. By the end of January, Libya's production was around 300,000 bpd, but Sanalla told Bloomberg it could go as low as 72,000 bpd. That's down from over 1.2 million bpd before the blockade.

By April, production had gone below 100,000 bpd, and NOC's Sanalla said losses had reached $4 billion. In early June, there were reports about restarting production at the country's largest field, El Sharara, which has a capacity of 300,000 bpd. Initial production was to be set at 30,000 bpd, however, to gradually ramp up to maximum over 90 days.

11402731,2020-05-06,"Coronavirus coverage might overshadow the recent developments in Libya, yet rarely has the situation on ground been more complex and difficult to predict. Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar first announced that he is about to take control of entire Libya, allegedly spearheading a ""popular mandate"" to consolidate the North African country, only to later declare a month-long ceasefire for the entire holy month of Ramadan. The internationally-recognized government of National Accord (GNA) riposted by declaring that it does not trust Haftar and that its fighters would continue fighting, disregarding the unilateral ceasefire announced by the Field Marshal. More fighting, less long-term certainty and no thought for Libya's ailing oil sector - a combination of things that Libya needs the least on its road to recovery.

Field Marshal Haftar's army has been fighting to wrest control over Tripoli for 13 months already, yet the last 2-3 weeks witnessed a series of military victories of militias associated with the GNA. Sorman and Sabrata, two cities on the Mediterranean coast, have come under effective GNA control, complicating Haftar's quest of besieging Tripoli. The alteration in the ongoing civil war's course might be very well linked to Turkish armed forces increasing their involvement by means of drone reconnaissance flights and airstrikes against Haftar airbases, as well as military equipment and means of transport. It is against this background that the ceasefire should be assessed, just as the May 01 shelling of the Zanata neighborhood in Tripoli, fighting has reached an impasse and both sides see more benefit in taking the heat out of the fighting so that they can prepare for further military action.

With his strategic position weakened, Field Marshal Haftar is creating some smoke and mirrors for the international community, another round of lengthy deliberation on how the unified post-civil war Libya should come about. Even countries generally assumed to favor Haftar as the new Libyan national leader have lobbied against the sudden announcement - the UAE which has just recently supplied a sophisticated air missile defense system to Haftar has called upon all Libyan parties to stick to political process, French authorities claimed that unilateral action will not solve the conflict.

Russia also protested against the unilateral character of Haftar's announcement, saying that whatever future Libya is to have, it must take place with a social support across all sectors.

Yet all relevant parties are cognizant of the fact that absent any proper UN brokerage the political process is at best frozen, if not dead entirely. UN talks, the (seemingly) only international platform for constructive dialogue has seen its capacities debilitated this spring, with the position of the UN special envoy on Libya having been vacant for more than 2 months already. The spread of coronavirus might also render constructive talks difficult - heretofore Libya has only had 60-odd cases with 3 reported casualties, however the deadly virus might become a much bigger threat than it is now, especially in Tripoli where most previous cases were diagnosed. With no real prospect of a mediated outcome, where does this leave Libya's embattled oil sector?

Graph 1. Libya's Oil Production in 2020 (million barrels per day).

Since January 18 when Field Marshal Haftar started the ongoing blockade of all Libyan ports and export terminals, Libyan oil output has been in a freefall. Back in the day the chairman of the Libyan NOC Mustafa Sanalla predicted that if no measures are taken to counteract Haftar, Libya's oil production would plummet to 72kbpd, all the way from 1.2mbpd in mid-January. It might have seemed a very implausible proposition back in the day, but it turned out to be a prophetic one - as of April 30, Libya's production stood at 95kbpd. The CEO of the Italian oil firm ENI Claudio Descalzi stated during one of his most recent executive calls that he expects Libyan production to come back to normal around end June. It remains to be seen what could potentially kickstart such an output rebound.

Currently only two oil-producing objects are safe from any military blockade - Libya's offshore assets, Bouri and Al Jurf, both located along the Tunisian maritime border. The ENI-operated Bouri field was Libya's first offshore venture, having decommissioned the previous floating storage and offloading vessel, Bouri is now utilizing a brand new FSO with 1.5 MMbbls of storage capacity. The Total-operated Al Jurf has a production capacity of 45kbpd and is using the Farwah FPSO, wielding an aggregate storage capacity of 0.9 MMbbls. Given that the Libyan national oil company holds 70% of Bouri and 50% of Al-Jurf, its share of Libya's total output stands around 60kbpd, which has left an indelible mark on NOC's financial stature.

According to data provided by the Libyan NOC, the cumulative financial losses arising from the production blockade amount to $4.35 billion as of end-April. In terms of output lost, some 110 million barrels have been missing, with Libya's output effectively consisting exclusively of offshore fields. The Libyan NOC's income revenues have parched up compared to last year's relative financial bounty, February incomes were at a mere $555 million, roughly a quarter of last year's average. With oil production decreasing to the lowest minimum possible, nationwide availability of transport fuels has been deplorable.

11402732,2020-03-05,"As the coronavirus spreads fast outside China, dampening consumer and business sentiment, analysts continue cutting their forecasts of oil demand growth this year.

In one of the latest downward revisions, Rystad Energy slashed on Thursday its global oil demand growth projection to just 500,000 bpd for this year, down from an initial pre-outbreak estimate of 1.1 million bpd, which was cut by 25 percent in February.

""Our data now point to a much more pessimistic outcome, with growth likely to fall to merely 500,000 bpd, and this is assuming that the Covid-19 epidemic will largely be contained by the end of June, which in turn implies a further downside risk,"" Rystad Energy said on Thursday.

Rystad's revised oil demand growth forecast comes after IHS Markit warned that oil demand in Q1 would likely register the largest decline on record, larger even than the slump that accompanied the 2008 financial crisis.

Even if the OPEC+ coalition agrees on Friday to deepen the current cuts by 1.5 million bpd in Q2, this will not be enough to rebalance the market and prop up prices, according to Bjørnar Tonhaugen, Rystad Energy's Senior Vice President, Head of Oil Markets.

The OPEC+ group is meeting on Friday in Vienna, where OPEC will be trying to persuade Russia to sign up to a massive 1.5 million bpd cut in Q2.

If Russia agrees to this proposal, Brent Crude prices could stay above $50 a barrel, as long as Libya's 1 million bpd production remains shut in, Rystad says.

All three scenarios Rystad has modeled include the assumption that Libya's production will return to normal in April.

If OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners reach a kind of a 'low-level compromise' -- agreeing to deepen the cuts by 600,000 bpd in Q2 and extending the current agreement -- Brent Crude prices could fall to the low $40s in the second quarter.

At 27.84 million bpd, the cartel's February average was 510,000 bpd lower than the January average, with Libya's production at a little over 120,000 bpd, down from over 1.2 million bpd at the start of the year. Only Iraq and Nigeria pumped more oil than they had agreed to, but this still kept production cut compliance levels above 100 percent, at 128 percent.

Just days before the meeting of OPEC and its partners in Vienna, sources from the organization said OPEC was discussing even deeper cuts, adding another 1 million to the current cuts of 1.7 million bpd, up from an earlier proposal to deepen the cuts by 600,000 bpd.

Also, the group could go ahead and deepen the cuts even if Russia decides to sit this round out, the sources, who spoke to Reuters earlier this week, said.

""Saudi Arabia wants to hold prices from falling, but Russia is still not agreeing. So the only way might be for OPEC to cut alone, which will not send a good signal to the market,"" one source said, while another added, ""There should be a cut, there is no other option.""

After on Friday OPEC slashed its oil demand outlook for this year by 230,000 bpd, the Energy Information Administration followed, revising its global oil demand forecast by as much as 378,000 bpd on the back of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak.

The authority said it expected the outbreak to reduce China's oil demand by some 190,000 bpd this year due to travel restrictions prompted by the outbreak.

OPEC last Friday said it expected global oil demand to rise by 990,000 bpd this year, most of which will come from non-OECD countries. OECD demand, the cartel said in its February edition of its Monthly Oil Market Report, will grow by a modest 100,000 bpd.

The International Energy Agency went further: it warned that global oil demand will actually take a dip during the first quarter of the year because of the coronavirus outbreak. The dip will be significant, the IEA said, at 435,000 bpd, representing the first contraction in demand in a decade.

As for the rest of the year, the IEA said it expected demand to grow by 825,000 bpd, a downward revision close to that made by the EIA, at 365,000 bpd.

These updates should be worrying for oil producers even though some observers are already talking about a quick recovery.

11402736,2020-02-12,"Crude oil prices hesitated today after the Energy Information Administration reported a U.S. oil inventory build of 7.5 million barrels for the first week of February.

The report came a day after the American Petroleum Institute estimated an inventory build of 6 million barrels. Analysts had expected a build of 2.93 million barrels for the period, after the EIA reported an inventory increase of 3.4 million barrels for the prior week.

Refineries processed 16 million bpd last week, the EIA said, and produced 9.2 million bpd of gasoline and 4.8 million bpd of distillate fuel. This compares with a processing rate of 16 million bpd a week earlier, gasoline production of 9.9 million bpd, and distillate fuel production of 5 million bpd.

Gasoline inventories last week shed a modest 100,000 barrels, after a draw of the same size for the previous week.

Distillate inventories fell by 2 million barrels in the week to February 7, after a 1.5-million-barrel decline reported a week earlier.

Oil began regaining ground earlier today after reports from China suggested the coronavirus outbreak may have peaked, with new case reporting slowing down. Medical experts, however, have warned against harboring great hopes that the spread of the disease has peaked, saying the virus can yet surprise forecasters.

Even so, investor sentiment seems to be improving and this is being reflected in oil prices. At the time of writing Brent crude was trading at $56.09 a barrel, up by almost 4% from yesterday's close before the release of EIA's report, and West Texas Intermediate was trading at $51.62 a barrel, up by over 3 percent.

Yet before we call it a true oil price rally it would have to continue for more than a day and there are factors that could end said rally before it properly begins.

11402737,2020-02-07,"Russia will support deeper oil production cuts across OPEC and its partners, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told media at an event in Mexico.

""We support this idea,"" the top diplomat said, adding that President Putin had recently discussed the coronavirus outbreak with the King of Saudi Arabia.

""Of course it will have some consequences for the oil market,"" Lavrov said.

Yesterday, sources from the oil cartel told Reuters that the joint ministerial panel overseeing the current cuts had recommended adding 600,000 bpd to the total in response to the oil price flop that followed the coronavirus outbreak. Russia, the source said then, was against additional cuts, but supported an extension of the current ones.

Currently, the production cuts are around 2.1 million bpd after Saudi Arabia willingly cut its production more than it had committed to, adding 400,000 bpd to its cut quota. This means that with another 600,000 bpd off the market, the effective cuts could reach 2.7 million bpd at full compliance. They could also last until the end of the year if the group agrees to extend them beyond March - something that would be easier to agree on with Russia.

According to OPEC sources, the decision to recommend these additional cuts took into account not just the weaker demand following the Chinese outbreak, but also a return of Libya's production on the market at some point this year.

""The 600,000 bpd has taken into consideration the expected return of Libya oil production and all scenarios for oil demand growth,"" the source told Reuters.

The news about Russia backing the additional cuts was positive for prices, but not by much at the time of writing. The full effect of the development should become evident later today, but it may turn out to be more limited than OPEC+ is hoping for as concern about the coronavirus outbreak continues to trump any positive news for oil.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Russia', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Mexico', 'Libya', 'China']",Russia Supports Deeper OPEC+ Output Cuts | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Russia-Supports-Deeper-OPEC-Output-Cuts.html,None,

""The recommendation is for a cut of 600,000 bpd. Russia has asked for more time for consultations,"" one of the Reuters source said.

Yesterday, Bloomberg cited participants in the meeting as saying that Russia remained opposed to deeper cuts although it was not against the extension of current ones. This opposition is hardly surprising: Russia has consistently budgeted for lower oil prices than the actual ones since the 2014 price collapse, and as a result is much more resilient to price drops than Saudi Arabia. It has also signaled repeatedly it is making a compromise with its oil industry in supporting the cuts as they are.

""If it were intractable they would have left by now,"" RBC Capital's Helima Croft told Bloomberg. ""It's a quest for consensus still. But certainly it shows that this is not easy.""

The meeting in Vienna was called as an emergency response move after oil prices took a nosedive following the outbreak of the coronavirus in China. Soon after news of the virus spread, analysts began warning of a negative impact on China's oil demand and, consequently, on prices. Prices anticipated the drop in demand, however, falling before the first data about lower fuel sales came in.

Saudi Arabia is pushing for additional cuts of half a million barrels daily, according to reports cited by Al Jazeera. Russia is against it and this time it may have an additional reason for its opposition; additional cuts may simply not work.

Libya's production recently went from some 1.3 million bpd to about 300,000 bpd because of a continuing blockade of its oil export terminals that also led to the shutdown of several fields. This means a production decline of as much as 1 million bpd. Prices, however, have remained indifferent to this drop in global output.

One could argue that traders are much more responsive to concerted actions by OPEC+ but this response will not last long. Even the December agreement to extend the existing cuts failed to push oil prices lower for more than a week.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Russia', 'Saudi Arabia', 'China', 'Vienna', 'Libya']","OPEC Aims For 600,000 Bpd Cut, But Russia Remains Reluctant | OilPrice.com",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Aims-For-600000-Bpd-Cut-But-Russia-Remains-Reluctant.html,None,
11402739,2020-02-04,"Libya is producing about 204,000 bpd of crude oil at the moment, an unnamed source has told Bloomberg, as a blockade of the country's export terminals and several fields enters its third week.

This is the lowest production level since 2011, when Libya's civil war began, and a drop from about 1.2-1.3 million bpd pumped before the blockade. Last month, the head of the National Oil Corporation warned that production could fall to zero if the blockade continues.

Forces affiliated with the Libyan National Army, itself affiliated with the eastern Libyan government that is fighting the UN-recognized one in Tripoli, seized Libya's oil exporting terminals in mid-January as well as several pipelines feeding oil from the nearby fields. This in turned prompted the shutdown of the fields, dealing a severe blow to Libya's production that was on its path to recovery after years of outages.

Following the blockade, NOC declared force majeure on oil exports with Sanalla warning that losses could reach $55 million daily. New outlets estimated lost barrels at between 500,000 and 800,000 daily. Yet the current production number, as revealed by the Bloomberg source, shows losses have exceeded 800,000 substantially, reaching 1 million bpd.

As of the end of January, the blockade had cost Libya some $560 million, Petroleum Economist reported last Friday, adding that NOC's Sanalla had once again appealed for help to Western powers. So far, however, help has come in verbal form only, the West unwilling to engage directly in Libya.

The blockade could continue for months, according to one analyst. ""There is...potential for the oil blockade to stretch on for months as both sides refuse to back down,"" Hamish Kinnear from Verisk Maplecroft told Forbes' Scott Carpenter.

The LNA under General Khalifa Haftar, last year began a surprise offensive against the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord with the ambition to oust it and establish the control of the eastern government and get access to the oil money of Libya. The offense is ongoing, with peace talks failing miserably to produce any results.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli']","Libya Oil Production Slips To 200,000 Bpd | OilPrice.com",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libya-Oil-Production-Slips-To-200000-Bpd.html,None,
11402740,2020-01-28,"Libya is facing the risk of its oil production grinding to near full stop if a blockade of its export terminals and several fields continues, the chairman of the country's troubled National Oil Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla, told Bloomberg.

A group of paramilitary formations affiliated with General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army occupied the export terminals last week along with pipelines and fields. The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord, which is recognized by the United Nations.

Soon after the blockade, NOC declared force majeure on oil exports, with Sanalla warning that the blockade could end up costing Libya $55 million daily. At the time, the losses in production were estimated at between 500,000 bpd and 800,000 bpd. Now, Libya's production is around 300,000 bpd but Sanalla told Bloomberg it could go as low as 72,000 bpd. That's down from over 1.2 million bpd before the blockade.

So far, according to NOC's chairman, the blockade has cost Libya $318 million but it has also cost NOC a budget that the GNA had previously approved to pursue oil production growth. Plans were to boost the daily average to 2.1 million bpd by 2024.

Losses will continue accumulating until the situation is resolved quickly as Libya does not have storage capacity for whatever oil is still being produced. In this context, there might even be a possibility for a complete halt of oil production.

Meanwhile, things are not looking up. At a round of peace talks in Germany last weekend that continued in Moscow on Monday, General Haftar refused to even meet the Prime Minister of the GNA, Fayez al-Serraj, let alone accept a peace deal. Instead, the LNA launched an attack on the city of Misrata, which is loyal to the GNA.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Misrata', 'Moscow', 'Germany']",Is Libya's Oil Production Heading To Zero? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Is-Libyas-Oil-Production-Heading-To-Zero.html,None,
11402791,2020-07-12,"Global oil market analysts are carefully watching the latest news emerging from Africa's (potentially) largest oil producer. In an unexpected move, Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) stated lifted the force majeure on crude exports from its key terminals. The national oil company indicated that it expects a gradual revamp of production, but emphasizes that overall production levels will be less than 50 percent of its historic highs. The company indicated that significant damage to reservoirs and oil and gas infrastructure in the country, caused by the blockade that has been in place since mid-January 2020, has left a segment of its production at risk. The removal of the force majeure by NOC surprised many observers as the security situation in the country doesn't appear to be improving. The move has left some analysts wondering if NOC has been able to set up a deal between the UN-supported GNA government and some parts of general Haftar's LNA forces. Others have suggested that significant pressure from third parties may have forced the two groups to agree to an oil deal. The North African oil producer has seen oil production collapse due to the conflict between the UN-backed GNA and the self-styled Libyan National Army of Khalifa Haftar. Since mid-January, a force majeure was declared by NOC on crude loadings out of the ports of Marsa El Hariga, Brega, Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Zueitina, and Zawiya. Total Libyan oil production fell to between 70,000 and 100,000 bpd in the past few months, from over 1.10 million bpd before the blockade. Despite the positive news from NOC, optimism about Libyan oil production should be tempered. The situation on the respective oil-producing fields is far from positive, while damage to infrastructure and possible reserve issues are expected to keep production very low in the coming months. NOC also stated that the forced closure of several of Libya's oil fields has affected the oil reservoir quality, which has undergone mechanical, structural, and chemical changes.

The broader geopolitical situation in which Libya finds itself is another reason for analysts to temper optimism. UN chief Guterres stated that foreign interference in Libya has reached 'unprecedented levels,' without directly stating the main culprits. It is looking increasingly likely that we will see a military operation by GNA forces, backed by Turkey, on the Sirte region. Any military action in the Sirte region would be a direct danger to NOC's future plans, as oil production and exports in the region would likely be halted. The GNA and Turkish officials have openly stated that they are preparing a move against Sirte, currently in the hands of LNA forces, to regain control of the area's strategic oil reserves. Indirectly Turkey has stated that it wants to regain power over the Sirte area in order to deliver a major blow to Haftar's LNA and its backers, Russia, UAE, and Egypt. The UN is currently trying in vain to set up a possible political solution for the crisis, but the developments on the ground suggest that there is no political will for such a deal at the moment.

As things stand, two major external forces are on track to clash in a military conflict within Libya. Turkish forces have recently put their full backing behind the GNA, while Egypt has promised the protect Haftar's forces. Egyptian President Sisi has stated that any violation of Sirte and Al-Jufra will result in direct intervention from the Egyptian military as per international norms. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry stated that ""these threats clearly and currently endanger Egypt, and we will not tolerate these types of threats which are close to our borders, at a time when foreign interference provides those militants with support.""

To show their readiness to intervene, Egypt has held a military drill near the Libyan border called ""Hasm 2020"". This drill was a direct reaction to a Turkish statement that the Turkish navy will hold exercises off the Libyan coast. Egyptian defense sources have stated that Hasm 2020 involved Egypt's Armed Forces' land, maritime, and air defense. Some analysts expect more Egyptian naval maneuvers near Libyan waters in the coming days. The Turkish Navy said the maneuvers, called ""Naftex"", will take place off the Libyan coast, involving 17 warplanes and eight naval vessels. Ankara has reportedly reserved an area for military exercises in the Mediterranean, according to Turkish news Yeni ?afak, slated to be three different regions, named Barbaros, Turgut Reis, and Çaka Bey, off the Libyan coast. On June 11th, Turkish armed forces held a maneuver in the Mediterranean with eight naval ships and 17 fighter jets.

A possible conflict between Egypt and Turkey is now a very real possibility. Such a conflict would likely draw in other forces as Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus are indirectly involved already. Turkish military moves, including a possible Sirte operation, will need to be backed up by Turkish naval forces. These naval forces would need to go via the maritime areas of the East Med countries, regardless of Libya and Turkey signing a bilateral EEZ agreement. Cairo is unlikely to back down any time soon as Ankara has been supplying armed drones, military advisors, and Syrian mercenaries to the U.N.-recognized GNA. On July 4, Al Watiya airbase, where Turkey had started to deploy some of its MIM-23 Hawk air defense missiles, was attacked by unidentified airplanes. There are rumors that this attack involved Rafale fighters, which would suggest that Egypt is already involved as the country has a large fleet of such fighters. Military analysts clarified that Egypt's Rafales are equipped with long-range air-to-surface Storm Shadow missiles, able to evade any low to medium-altitude air defenses.

Until now, there are a lot of open questions, but Turkey's willingness to take part in the Libyan conflict has put it on a collision course with Egypt, the UAE, and possibly even Israel. Turkish Airforce and Navy capabilities are impressive, but Egypt and its partners have a geographic advantage. A significant Egyptian military intervention in Libya would be a litmus test for Ankara's resolve. In the end, Turkey will have to transport its armor across the Mediterranean while Egypt would just have to drive or fly across the border.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Sirte', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Zawiya, Libya', 'Brega', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Ankara', 'Russia', 'Israel', 'Greece', 'Cyprus', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Cairo', 'Syria']",Libya Is On The Brink Of A Major Military Conflict | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Libya-Is-On-The-Brink-Of-A-Major-Military-Conflict.html,None,
11402792,2020-07-05,"The rosy future of the offshore East Mediterranean (East-Med) gas boom is in jeopardy. The current COVID-related economic downturn, combined with the dramatic drop in demand for oil and gas worldwide, has already led to several delays for major offshore gas projects in Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, and Greece. Offshore E&P budgets have been cut by all oil and gas companies, leaving no room for high-risk natural gas developments in the East Med in the coming years. At the same time, geopolitical and military tensions between Turkey and the other players in the region, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, and even Israel is rising fast. Ankara's unexpected but strong support for the Libyan Tripoli-based government which is fighting out a long-lasting conflict against East Libyan general Haftar's LNA forces has not only tilted the power structure in Libya, but has also put Ankara, as a NATO member, on a collision course with Russia and the UAE.

At the same time, Turkish military moves in Libya, aiming to not only open up Africa's largest oil reserves to Turkish companies but also to expand its sphere of influence in the East Med, have put a confrontation with Egypt and possibly France on the table. In 2020, a military confrontation between NATO members (Turkey-France) or allies of NATO (UAE, Egypt, Israel) in the Middle East is no longer unthinkable. Ankara's approach in Libya suggests an aggressive Turkish military strategy intended to set up military bases in the region.

On July 3, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar and Chief of General Staff Gen. Yasar Guler have visited Libya to review the activities carried out under a memorandum of understanding between the two countries. The main focus during the visit was the expansion of the Defense Security Cooperation and Training Assistance Advisory Command, which was created within the scope of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Turkey and Libya on November 27, 2019. In the same MOU, Turkey and Libya signed the highly contested EEZ agreement, that asserts Turkey's rights in the Eastern Mediterranean, putting Ankara on a full collision course with Cyprus, Egypt, and Greece. A military confrontation of some sort has been a distinct possibility since that moment.

Turkey-Libya maritime deal, via trtworld.com Ankara's aggressive moves, however, may have reached a point of no return in the last few days.

On June 10, Turkish navy vessels conducted radar-targeting on a French warship trying to approach a Turkish civilian ship suspected of skirting a NATO arms embargo on Libya. French government sources have reported that France's Courbet frigate was ""lit up"" three times by Turkish radar. The incident has led to the end of French support for the NATO naval mission, while officially requesting a NATO investigation.

France, and indirectly other NATO countries, such as Italy and Greece, are now openly discussing supporting the Eastern Libyan general Haftar, whose forces have come under pressure after his latest military assault on the GNA ruled region around Tripoli ended in an unexpected defeat. Egypt has also now openly warned Turkey and the GNA forces not to cross the Sirte line, a key threshold in the Libyan oil sector. If Ankara and Tripoli continue their military advance, Egyptian president Sisi has warned that the Egyptian armed forces will enter Libya to support Haftar.

The current crisis within NATO (and the EU), sparked by Turkish actions is a major concern.

A military conflict within the alliance will not only weaken its position with regards to Russia's power projections, but also puts security in the (East) Mediterranean at risk. France at present lobbying to put sanctions on Turkey. On July 13, a council of EU foreign ministers will discuss EU-Turkish relations.

While all eyes are now on Libya, Turkey's military moves in the East Med are even more worrying. As some have indicated already, Turkey's Libya adventure falls within the strategy of squeezing the Middle East into submission. Ankara's military projects in Qatar, the Horn of Africa, Sudan, and now Libya, set up a circle of military power threatening Arab nations, at least in their views. East Med military moves, officially to support Turkish oil and gas companies to search for offshore reserves, are a direct threat to Greece and Cyprus. The so-called ultra-nationalist ""Blue Homeland"" military strategy adopted by Turkey is clear in its goals. Erdogan's military doctrine targets the domination of the Aegean, most of the Mediterranean, and of the Black Sea. The ongoing provocations in the East Med, which doesn't only include Greece-Cyprus but also Egypt and Israel, are the evidence.

The current chaos in NATO and the EU could hamper a joint concerted action in case of unwanted Turkish action in the region. During the last couple of years, analysts have focused on perceived U.S./Washington support for East Med economic and energy integration via the East Med Gas Forum.

The U.S. Senate and Congress have even supported some anti-Turkish moves, such as the end of military sanctions on Cyprus. Washington, especially via its thinktanks, such as Atlantic Council, has been painting a positive pro-East Med (Greece, Cyprus, Egypt-Israel) picture of economic, political, and military support. This policy, as has been stated by some, needs to be taken with a truck-load of salt, as the Trump Administration is once again opening up to Ankara.

A U.S.-NATO intervention or a concentrated EU move in the case of Turkish action seems unrealistic, and Erdogan seems to know this based on his recent actions. As long as Europe and NATO, both of which have their HQs in Brussels, keep a low profile without countering Turkish moves, Greece and Cyprus will be the next targets for a Turkish military move.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Ankara', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Israel', 'Greece', 'France', 'Egypt', 'Cyprus', 'Russia', 'Lebanon', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Tripoli', 'Washington, D.C.']",Turkey's Latest Geopolitical Gamble Could Result In Catastrophe | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Turkeys-Latest-Geopolitical-Gamble-Could-Result-In-Catastrophe.html,None,
11402793,2020-07-05,"We are now at a crossroads in Libya where a military solution is temporarily off the table, as factions and their external allies wrangle over oil revenues--the distribution of which will now decide when the pumps are turned back on and force majeure lifted. For the first time in seven years, there is a light at the end of the Libyan tunnel, but with open and backdoor talks being brokered by various external allies, sorting rumor from fact and wishful thinking is tricky.

What we know for sure is this: It's all about leverage, and the Turkish-backed GNA doesn't have nearly enough to call the shots on this one despite recent territorial gains in and around Tripoli against General Haftar.

Now, with Egypt stepping up to the plate and drawing a red line in Sirte, the strategic gateway to the Libyan oil facilities, the potential for oil revenue negotiations is emerging.

Haftar controls the oil, but not the revenues, and if everyone now has the right balance of leverage for talks to proceed, he could turn the pumps back on in return for a different setup for the distribution of oil revenues.

Right now, all the revenues go to the central bank in Tripoli, where Haftar has no access.

Depending on the source, talks are going on behind the scenes that would split up these revenues before they hit the central bank in Tripoli.

According to the Guardian, ""proposals in the talks include that the revenues be split between as many as three banks representing different regions, with an agreement not to use them for military purposes. Eastern tribal leaders are being consulted on the plans.""

This version of events is also being spread about through various other media, and the National Oil Company (NOC)--a neutral source in all of this--takes issue with the scenario as presented.

While the NOC confirms that talks are in progress and that it is optimistic that the result will be to turn on the taps and remove the force majeure on exports from the Hariga, Brega, Zueitina, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports, it denies there is any talk of splitting revenues in the manner described above.

""We categorically deny all the rumours about opening new accounts and distributing those revenues to three regions by percentage. Those rumours are spread by people who are not involved in the negotiations and only reflect their personal points of view. NOC adheres to Libyan laws and procedures"", said NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla.

The NOC claims that all oil revenues will continue to go to the ""same accounts of the corporation"", but will be ""preserved for a specific period of time during which two parallel tracks are launched"". In other words, the oil revenues will be dealt with differently, but the NOC says they will not be divided up into three regions by percentage.

The NOC defines those ""parallel tracks"" as one that will ""ensure financial transparency"" (which was lacking) and one will ""focus on the restructuring of security arrangements to protect oil facilities"".

""Our position consists of working to resume production in order to preserve the wealth of the Libyan people and serve its interests, and to avoid war at oil sites. We subscribe to the unity of Libya. We are against anything that would harm its unity and sovereignty and we will not be part of any action against that"", the NOC chairman added.

But the devil, as always, is in the detail. Both are essentially saying the same thing, but one sounds less controversial. It's similar to the logic of not negotiating with terrorists. If a deal is cut to redistribute oil revenues away from the Tripoli Central Bank and into the hands of a bank controlled by Haftar, then Haftar's hijacking of the country's oil facilities effectively worked--and would work in the future.

So any solution concerning oil revenues needs to be structured--and worded--very carefully in order to avoid the NOC's biggest fear: That the oil facilities will continue to be used for political capital, which means they will always be under threat.

That notion becomes even clearer with the arrival of Russian mercenaries at the giant Sharara and El-Feel oilfields, on behalf of General Haftar. That's another move by Haftar to secure his leverage, and is meant to prevent the NOC from restarting production until there is a revenue deal in place--in his favor.

The move follows the NOC's brief attempt to resume production at the 300,000bpd field last month--an event that sparked a massively exciting flurry of trading speculation only to be scuttled in a matter of days when it was forced to shut down again and reinstitute force majeure.

Major alliances such as NATO and the European Union mean nothing in this conflict.

On the sidelines, the European Union is suffering a bit of an existential crisis over Libya. Divided, and picking sides based on oil prospects, the European Union itself is not a player, which means it's largely leaving things up to Russia on the Haftar side and Turkey on the GNA side. And Libya is far too close geographically for the EU to so dangerously ignore.

NATO ""allies"" are also on different sides in this war.

And now, France, having gone head-to-head with Turkey over Libya, is pulling out of a NATO security operation in defiance after Turkey was caught violating the arms embargo against Libya.

France's ruffled feathers won't matter much.

11402794,2020-06-06,"Under pressure in Libya--where it's gone head-to-head with General Haftar in an ongoing battle to decide who gets to ultimately control the country's oil revenues--and floundering in Syria, Turkey is once again upping the ante in the Mediterranean, this time preparing to issue new oil and gas exploration licenses in direct confrontation with the European Union.

It's not just about Cyprus, anymore. Turkey's state-run oil and gas company has been given licenses from the Turkish government to explore for oil and gas in 24 locations in the East Mediterranean. Seven of those locations are just off the coast of key Greek islands.

It's a direct provocation that has Greece infuriated, and experts worried that this could lead to direct clashes once Turkey starts exploration drilling.

On Monday, Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said in a statement that the country ""stands ready to deal with this provocation should Turkey decide to implement this decision"".

The draft plan explicitly violates Greek sovereignty, and it is designed to take advantage of a new maritime boundary agreement Erdogan wrangled last year with the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya. This was the trade-off for Libya's aid in fighting back General Haftar in his push to take the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

The maritime boundary is meant to perform a pincer movement against Cyprus, which is drilling offshore in its EEZ where Turkey has also provocatively deployed drillships. In the Greek Cypriot EEZ alone, there are an estimated 120 billion cubic meters of natural gas, for which drilling began in 2011. The first license here was granted in 2008 to American Noble Energy (the same company behind the massive Israeli discoveries).

Erdogan's desperation is born out of the fact that Turkey is being squeezed out of a role in the oil and gas riches of the Mediterranean, which is arguably the world's next biggest, untapped oil and gas hotspot.

This brewing confrontation took root most noticeably in 2010/2011 when Israel made a massive discovery of gas offshore in the Levantine Basin, with the Leviathan and Tamar fields, both of which are now pumping and exporting and threatening to shift the balance of power from Turkey all the way to Egypt and everywhere in between. His latest move to issue more exploration licenses, even encroaching on Greek maritime territory, comes after Israel, Greece and Cyprus signed an agreement to build an underwater pipeline to carry Israeli gas to Europe, cutting out Turkey altogether.

This $7-billion underwater pipeline would run for some 2,200 kilometers to Italy, running by the coast of Cyprus and the Greek island of Crete and through the Egyptian maritime zone and the Libyan maritime zone.

Prior to this maritime deal, Turkey, Libya, and Greek Cyprus had agreements with Lebanon and Egypt in terms of oil and gas exploration. But the new demarcation scoops up 39,000 square kilometers of EEZ held by Greece.

Source: Middleasteye.net

Turkey will find itself (as usual) rather alone in this fight with the exception of Russia which finds its own designs aligning with Turkey because this Israeli gas would undermine Russian gas in Europe. But Turkey is a fickle (at best) ally.

Erdogan will want to use this leverage to force the pipeline coalition to include a Trans Anatolian tie-in for passing through the newly demarcated maritime zone between Libya and Turkey. His new licensing of exploration for Turkish Petroleum in Greece's maritime zone is intended to send a specific message: Cut me in or I will make trouble, both offshore Greece and offshore Cyprus.

Erdogan, and his desire to restore Turkey's Ottoman Empire prowess, is making a play for leverage in order to be a part of this new energy equation.

It won't be easy, but Erdogan is counting on a lack of effective response from the European Union, as well as from the UAE and Egypt--all of which issued a joint statement last month condemning the maritime territorial grab. Erdogan's response was to call the country signatories an ""alliance of evil"".

Tensions are expected to gain further momentum later this month, when the leaders of the pipeline coalition countries are due to meet in Israel, with Greece and Cyprus attending separately.

But in the meantime, much like Iran succeeds in provoking the United States without much of a response, Erdogan will continue to push EU buttons and get a slap on the wrist in return. EU Foreign Affairs Minister Josep Borrell has said that the bloc has sent a ""strong message"" to Turkey, but other than being ""in close contact"" with colleagues in Cyprus and Greece, and kindly calling on Turkey to ""stop drilling in areas where there is an EEZ or territorial waters of Cyprus and Greece"", the claws aren't out and the teeth aren't bared and Athens and Nicosia are likely wondering if they're going to have to get physical on their own.

Still, the tension between Saudi Arabia and Russia is manifesting in the public arena, with calls this week between the two indicating that while the Saudis may push for the deeper cuts to be extended through the end of the year, Russia may be leery of doing so--dragging its feet in signing up for more pain just to open the door for U.S. shale to catch enough of a breath to roar back into the market. Rumors surfaced this week that Rosneft is feeling the pain of the production cuts, and has questioned its ability to maintain contractual oil supplies as a result. But if oil inventories are indeed bloated as industries suggest, this is a hard sell to a market that has just survived negative pricing as global storage threatens to reach maximum capacity.

Second, Moscow has shown its hand in Libya. Last week we noted that General Haftar's external allies in the fight for Libya will either have to show their hand or let the Turks control this game with the GNA, while the UAE (a Haftar ally) would be happy to partition the country and have a foothold in a Haftar-run Eastern Libya.

11402797,2020-05-24,"The GNA's militias and Turkish forces backed by Syrian refugee-mercenaries in Libya are no match for the combined firepower of General Haftar's LNA, allied militias, and a host of powerful countries, such as the UAE and Egypt, with Russian mercenaries added in for good measure.

Yet, against all odds, with Haftar at the gates of the capital and ready to take control of Libya, the Turks have managed not only to halt his push into Tripoli but to force his retreat from key strategic areas.

Nearly everyone was in Haftar's corner in a conflict that featured a vast gathering of major external forces, all eyeing a piece of the balance of power in this post-Gaddafi oil-rich setup.

Turkey has been successful largely by default, as Haftar's allies have pressed the pause button. Erdogan has deployed surface-to-air missile defense systems to Libya, and that has been a bit of a spoiler for the UAE's armed drones for Haftar, making it difficult for the General to win an aerial campaign.

The past couple of weeks have seen Haftar lose so much ground that his goal of taking Tripoli now seems rather remote.

On Monday, the General lost a key airbase.

On Wednesday, the GNA captured a Russian-built, UAE-financed air defense system.

On Thursday, the Government of National Accord (GNA) launched airstrikes against Haftar's forces as they were withdrawing from the front lines of the capital, Tripoli. A key target was the General's stronghold of Tarhouna.

So what happens next?

Where it concerns Haftar, this isn't the end. The General will now specifically target Turkish forces.

Saqr Al-Jaroushi, Haftar's air force chief, has vowed to unleash the ""largest aerial campaign in Libyan history"" with all Turkish positions now ""legitimate targets for our airforce.""

Tripoli also says that a Russian base in Syria had recently delivered Soviet-era jets to Haftar. Russia, for one, has been humiliated in Libya--even though it has maintained plausible deniability for those mercenaries on the ground. Putin is now effectively fighting Turkey--its ally--in two venues: Syria and Libya, and while their goals sometimes align over desires to control the natural resources of the Mediterranean, it is difficult to imagine the Russian president allowing a scenario in which it is bested by the Turks. Hence the new shipment of jet fighters that will most definitely target Turkish forces.

So, what about the UAE? It also has a lot of skin in this game and has likewise been humiliated.

The UAE is eyeing a number of spoils from Libya, but the problem for Haftar is that it would also be content to see the country partitioned, with Haftar solidly in control of the east if he can't take and keep Tripoli on his own.

How Washington responds to Haftar's recent losses in Libya will depend on what the UAE wants to a large extent. That's because Washington is the benefactor of piles of cash from the UAE's immense lobbying power.

To put this into perspective, in 2018 alone, there were 20 firms registered as foreign agents for UAE clients in the US, and those firms received over $20 million just for public information campaigns in the United States.

What does the UAE want, exactly?

In Libya, for starters, it's the highly lucrative task of rebuilding the country post-conflict, and building influence in a new government along the way. This would still be lucrative for the UAE (and the Saudis, as well) if Haftar only manages to secure eastern and southern Libya, which would mean he would still control the oil production, if not the oil revenues.

The UAE would also like to gain sea access through Libya as its DP World port company is eyeing expansion in the eastern Mediterranean, which means access through Benghazi in eastern Libya.

The problem for Haftar is that the UAE--the biggest contributor to his war effort--is not exactly sold on the idea that Haftar can unify the entire country, so right now, it is hedging its bets, and control of eastern Libya is far more important for the UAE.

But the Turkish gambit will force the UAE into a more immediate decision on this.

And Haftar is now in trouble in the east, his power base, as well as his eastern allies waffle.

Earlier this month, armed militants linked to General Haftar stormed the headquarters of the Brega Oil Marketing Company in Benghazi, removing the company's director by force because he was supporting the eastern government's efforts towards a political agreement with the GNA in Tripoli.

Such an agreement would go against Haftar's recent declaration of a ""popular mandate"" to rule all of Libya.

If the UAE steps up to the plate to enforce a partition of Libya into east and west, Haftar doesn't need Tripoli because he would control the bulk of the oil production and the ports, and eventually, he would begin exporting without the GNA. UAE lobbying money would likely see to it that he is recognized as the legitimate exporter in the end.

What the UAE won't stand for is a Turkish move on spoils in the eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey's state-run oil firm has applied for an exploration permit--a move condemned roundly by Cyprus, Egypt--another power player in the Libyan conflict on Haftar's side--and Greece.

So, the ball right now is really in the UAE's court, but regardless, Haftar will now be regrouping for a major assault on the Turks.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Washington (state)', 'United States', 'Egypt', 'Brega', 'Benghazi', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Greece', 'Cyprus']",Turkey Headed For An Unexpected Victory Libya's Oil War | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Africa/Turkey-Headed-For-An-Unexpected-Victory-Libyas-Oil-War.html,None,

According to exchanges data compiled by Reuters market analyst John Kemp, portfolio managers sold the equivalent of 16 million barrels in the six most important and most traded petroleum futures in the week to February 18.

Although last week was another week in which the net long position in petroleum futures dropped, hedge funds sold the fewest number of barrel equivalents for the past month since the coronavirus outbreak made headlines and started seriously affecting market sentiment over concerns about global oil demand.

In the week to February 18, money managers were net sellers of 28 million barrels of WTI Crude and 1 million barrels of Brent Crude, according to the data compiled by Kemp.

The previous week to February 11 had already shown signs that although liquidation of longs continued, the pace of rising shorts slowed after the early market panic. In the week to February 11, money managers sold the equivalent of 74 million barrels in the six most important petroleum contracts.

With Putin in Turkey on Wednesday ceremonially launching the much-anticipated offshore pipeline TurkStream, which will supply Russian gas to Turkey and southern Europe, it's actually events in Libya and Syria that are at the top of contentious discussions.

But there appears to have been a breakthrough which may or may not have any real impact on the Libyan war, just days after Turkey controversially ordered troops to Tripoli to the condemnation of pro-Haftar forces and its backers Egypt, the UAE, and Russia.

The Turkish and Russian presidents have called for a ceasefire in Libya that will start from Saturday (Jan.12) midnight, according to Turkish FM Cavusoglu, cited in Turkish state media.

The two sides issued a statement Wednesday calling for Gen. Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) to immediately come to the negotiating table.

As Middle East Eye reports:

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, speaking alongside his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, said he hopes the ceasefire will embolden the Berlin process seeking to resolve the conflict.

Related: Oil Falls Further On Bearish Inventory Data

""In a joint statement Presidents Erdogan and Putin urge parties to stop violence"" Cavusoglu said. Lavrov added that they expect neighbouring countries to actively join the Berlin process to help end the conflict.

It's only the GNA which is recognized by the United Nations, and at least still on paper the United States as well -- though Trump over the past half-year has issued public praise for Haftar, a dual US citizen considered close to the CIA.

The crisis has escalated over the past months as Haftar has declared his forces are in the ""final offensive"" to wrest control of the capital Tripoli from the GNA. On Saturday an LNA airstrike slammed into a military academy in Tripoli, killing at least 30 and injuring nearly 40.

Site of Saturday's deadly airstrike on the GNA military academy in Tripoli, via One America News.

Previewing the urgency of the Libya matter as Putin was set to meet with Erdogan, Turkish media noted:

Perhaps topping the agenda is Libya - Turkey has deployed troops to support the U.N.-approved government in Tripoli against an assault by the Moscow-backed Libyan National Army, led by General Khalifa Haftar.

Russia has told Ankara that Turkish soldiers should not oppose Haftar's militias, Deutsche Welle said citing one unidentified official. Erdo?an will assure Putin at Wednesday's meeting that Turkish soldiers will not enter combat, other officials say.

But we doubt such ""assurances"" proved enough, given Turkey is already supplying the GNA with advanced military hardware such as drones to push back Haftar's own small air force, which includes MiG fighters.

11402815,2020-09-30,"Libya's oil production has more than tripled since the port blockade has been lifted, reaching around 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) after the restart of another oilfield in the country, creating a new headache for fellow OPEC members who are trying to rebalance the market while demand is still weak.

The 200,000-bpd Sarir oilfield resumed operations on Tuesday, Bloomberg quoted the operator Arabian Gulf Oil Co (Agoco) as saying. The field is currently pumping just 30,000 bpd, but it took Libya's total production to nearly 300,000 bpd, up from less than 100,000 bpd before the blockade was lifted in the middle of September.

The head of the Libyan National Army (LNA), General Khalifa Haftar, whose troops, with help from affiliated groups, had blockaded Libya's oil ports in January, announced the end of the blockade on September 18.

A week after the blockade was lifted, Libya was producing around 250,000 bpd as of Sunday.

As of Wednesday, Libya's oil terminals at Hariga, Brega, and Zueitina continue to be open for business and are welcoming tankers to ship oil, although the biggest port and the terminal typically exporting the oil from the biggest oilfield in the country are still under force majeure.

The 300,000-bpd Sharara oilfield, Libya's largest, is still closed, as are the nearby El Feel oilfield with 70,000 bpd capacity and the Zawiya oil terminal typically exporting crude from Sharara.

Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) has previously said that the oilfields would need repairs and time to resume pumping oil at full capacity.

Despite the fact that the return of a full 1 million bpd supply from Libya is not imminent and will likely take months, the African OPEC member exempted from the OPEC+ cuts could be a supply headache for the production group going forward, if the Libyan truce holds.

11402816,2020-06-12,"The U.S. federal government is investigating reports that Libyan General Khalifa Haftar had traveled to Venezuela to discuss oil contracts, Reuters has reported, citing a government official.

An earlier report by the Wall Street Journal said that the U.S. was not the only country investigating these reports, adding that Haftar had reached out to Venezuela, as well as to brokers in the United Arab Emirates in a bid to raise money for his Libyan National Army through deals for the sale of crude oil.

Libyan, European, and U.S. officials told WSJ at the time that the reports had prompted the UN and the UN-recognized Libyan government to launch an investigation into a Dubai-based ship-chartering company for its alleged help to Haftar to sell Libyan crude in the Mediterranean.

Libya's National Oil Corporation is the only entity legally allowed to market Libyan crude, as per UN sanctions leveled on Libya during the civil war. Until last year, Haftar's Libyan National Army was friendly towards the NOC, after the LNA wrestled control of the country's oil export terminals from the Petroleum Facilities Guard, which had blockaded them to use as bargaining chop against the UN-recognized government.

And then the LNA made a grab for Tripoli, in the course of which groups affiliated with it blockaded the oil ports and prompted the suspension of oil production, bringing Libya's total from over 1 million bpd to under 100,000 bpd. NOC has estimated the losses at more than $5 billion.

And yet there seems to be enough oil to sell, judging by these reports.

Libya's oil production took a nosedive to less than 300,000 bpd last week, from over 1 million bpd following a blockade of its main oil export terminals, which has in turn prompted the shutdown of several large fields, the National Oil Corporation said as quoted by Reuters.

At the end of the week this improved somewhat, rising to a little above 320,000 bpd.

Tribal groups affiliated with General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army, itself affiliated with the eastern government of Libya, occupied the terminals last week and seized several fields in Libya's main oil producing region.

Among the affected fields were Sharara -- Libya's largest -- and neighboring El Feel, the two contributing almost a third of Libya's total output.

The Libyan National Oil Corporation declared force majeure on oil exports soon after the news of the seizures broke and warned that the blockade could cost the country $55 million daily, the Libya Observer reported. The blockade will also cost Libya between 500,000 and 800,000 bpd in lost oil production, according to different reports.

Before the blockade, Libya was pumping around 1.3 million bpd.

The blockade took place ahead of peace talks between Haftar and the UN-recognized Government of National Accord. The talks ended with no definitive result, although the negotiators upheld a ceasefire and an arms embargo agreed earlier by a dozen foreign countries and several regional organizations, but not by the warring parties in Libya. The latest media reports from Libya suggest the ceasefire and the arms embargo have not held.

11402856,2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg) - The blockade on Libyan oil exports imposed by one faction in the country's civil war will be lifted, potentially adding large volumes of crude into a weak market if other parties in the conflict accept the move.

General Khalifa Haftar said on television that he has decided to allow the reopening of Libya's oil ports ""as per conditions and guarantees that ensure a fair distribution of wealth and spare it being plundered or used in terrorism financing.""

It's unclear how much of the 1.1 million barrels a day Libya was pumping prior to the blockade can return to the market, or how quickly. The Tripoli-based Government of National Accord wants production to resume immediately, according to a copy of the agreement with Haftar's forces seen by Bloomberg.

However, Libya's National Oil Co. has previously denounced the ""secretive"" talks that led to Haftar's offer and has said it won't resume exports until foreign mercenaries leave the country. A spokesman for the NOC declined to comment on Friday.

Oil erased gains, with Brent crude dropping 1.1% to $42.84 a barrel as of 1:10 p.m. in London.

There have been false dawns before in efforts to resolve the long-running conflict between forces loyal to Haftar, who control eastern Libya, and the government based in Tripoli. Parameters of the deal announced on Friday were unclear.

Haftar had conditioned resuming production on a mechanism being in place to distribute revenue, officials said. The NOC, backed by the U.S. and United Nations, had proposed freezing revenue until that mechanism is decided, and also conditioned lifting the export shutdown on the withdrawal of Wagner, a Russian mercenary force, and other armed groups.

Any additional supplies would be entering the market at an unfortunate time, just as the recovery from the historic slump triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic is faltering.

11402865,2020-12-12,"(Bloomberg) --Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was guest of honor at Azerbaijan's military parade Thursday to mark its victory with Ankara's help over Moscow ally Armenia. If Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin was angry at the incursion into his former Soviet backyard, he wasn't showing it.

It was only the latest challenge from the Turkish leader that the normally assertive Putin has tolerated. That's because, as Erdogan seeks to mend ties with incoming U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, the Kremlin is confident Turkey will remain a thorn in the side of its fellow NATO members, fueling divisions that Moscow relishes.

U.S. plans approved by President Donald Trump, who's boasted of his warm relations with Erdogan, to sanction Turkey over its purchase of a Russian S-400 missile-defense system will only further complicate the Turkish leader's efforts to rebuild links with Washington.

From Azerbaijan to Syria to Libya, Erdogan's drive to rebuild Turkey's influence as a regional power has forced Russia to roll back its ambitions. Even as Erdogan increasingly positions himself as a check on the Kremlin's geopolitical reach, Putin has nothing but warm words for his Black Sea neighbor in public.

""Relations are very tense right now, there's competition and even an element of confrontation,"" said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Kremlin-founded Russian International Affairs Council. ""Still, cooperation with Turkey is so important strategically that Russia's ready to close its eyes to this.""

NATO Rift

The measured Russian response reflects the desire to nurture ties with Erdogan, who triggered an unprecedented rift within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with the 2017 deal for the S-400 system.

Too many differences remain between Turkey and the U.S. and Europe to prevent friction, and Erdogan won't stand for others trying to dictate how he behaves, a senior Russian government official told Bloomberg, asking not to be identified discussing policy issues.

Russia has experience of managing a volatile economic and political relationship with Turkey, even as Erdogan has sent Turkish forces and proxies to thwart Putin in regional hotspots.

Erdogan watched about 200 of his troops join Azerbaijani forces in the center of the capital, Baku, who paraded Turkish-made drones that were decisive in defeating Armenia during the 44-day war over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.

He's effectively stymied a Russian-backed effort to wipe out the last rebel-held redoubt in Syria, said three people in Moscow familiar with the situation, after also confronting the Kremlin in Libya.

While Ankara has been telling Western partners that its growing footprint in the ex-Soviet arena and the Middle East is a bulwark against an expansionist Russia, that doesn't mean Turkey's on the same page with them, said Kortunov. ""Under Biden, Erdogan's problems are likely to mount,"" he said.

Ancient Rivalry

Still, the strains between Moscow and Ankara are rekindling centuries of rivalry between the two former imperial powers. In 2015 Russia slapped crushing sanctions on Turkey after it shot down a Russian fighter jet on the border with Syria. On Wednesday, it barred imports of tomatoes from Azerbaijan, the country's biggest export after oil and gas.

The Russian leader has championed a multi-polar world in which regional powers challenge Washington's traditional leadership, but Erdogan is proving more than a match as they wrestle for influence.

""We're allies in some respects but in others our interests are diametrically opposed,"" said Andrei Baklanov, a former Russian diplomat who's served in posts including ambassador to Saudi Arabia and is now affiliated to the Valdai club in Moscow. ""We have to learn to live with this situation.""

While Putin secured a cease-fire between Azerbaijan and Armenia that allowed him to send Russian peace-keepers to Nagorno-Karabakh, Erdogan's assertiveness in supporting Baku during the war gained Turkey a role in overseeing the truce agreement.

In Syria, where Putin ally Bashar al-Assad wrested back control of most of the country thanks to Russian and Iranian support, Turkey has blocked government efforts to retake the key rebel bastion of Idlib. Russia, which sent mercenaries earlier this year to spearhead an assault on the city, has suspended the operation because of Turkish opposition, the three people familiar with the matter said.

In oil-rich Libya too, a Russian ally, eastern-based military chief Khalifa Haftar, is losing ground amid renewed efforts to negotiate a political settlement with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli that enjoys Turkish backing.

Turkey is also a major energy customer for Russia, but even here it has proven problematic. Once Moscow's top customer outside the former Soviet Union, Turkey has reduced gas purchases in recent years by turning to rival suppliers like Azerbaijan.

Putin in public praises Erdogan for his independence in doing energy and weapons deals with Russia despite opposition from its NATO allies. ""It's not just nice to work with that kind of partner, it's reliable,"" Putin said in October. As for differences between them, Russia needs to ""be patient"" and ""seek compromise,"" he said.

11402866,2020-12-08,"(Bloomberg) --Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the European Union to ""get rid of its strategic blindness"" as Greece pushed the bloc to target Turkey with tougher sanctions that could unleash a full-blown crisis in the eastern Mediterranean.

The moves mark the latest deterioration in relations between Turkey on the one hand and Greece and Cyprus on the other over Turkish energy exploration in waters claimed by both EU countries. Recent actions by Erdogan in relation to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus have also fueled tensions.

The EU ""should not allow itself to be used as a ram by the Greek-Cypriot side and Greece,"" Erdogan said in a pre-recorded video message for participants of a workshop on the eastern Mediterranean held in Antalya on Monday. The comments were released as EU foreign ministers in Brussels discussed relations with Turkey before the bloc's Dec. 10-11 summit, where Greece hopes to extract a commitment to step up penalties against Ankara.

Greece wants EU leaders on Thursday to give the bloc's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, ""a clear mandate"" to present targeted measures next month, including an arms embargo and the prohibition of financing of Turkish banks and companies by European institutions, according to a note circulated before the meeting and seen by Bloomberg News.

Such severe action has previously failed to garner the unanimous support of EU governments. Borrell said that Monday's meeting of the bloc's top diplomats showed a widespread view that ""the situation is not a positive one,"" while declining to speculate about what the bloc's leaders will decide to do.

Careful Assessment

""We have not seen a fundamental change of direction in the Turkish behavior,"" Borrell told reporters afterward. ""On the contrary, in several aspects the situation has worsened"" and ""all member states were very much aware of the need to assess carefully the situation with Turkey.""

In February, the EU imposed asset freezes and travel bans on two employees of Turkish Petroleum Corp. in response to Turkey's natural-gas gas hunt off Cyprus. A Cypriot proposal to include Turkish entities and add individuals to that blacklist has been held up since June.

One option for EU leaders this week is to push forward the Cypriot proposal. Another is to flesh out possibilities for broader, economy-focused penalties against Turkey floated by Borrell in late August.

Loggerheads

The government heads pledged on Oct. 1-2 to ""take decisions as appropriate at the latest"" in December. The vow was part of an agreement that unblocked EU sanctions against Belarus by winning over Cyprus, which had pressed the bloc to take a tougher stance against Turkey.

Ankara is at loggerheads with Greece and Cyprus over maritime borders in the Eastern Mediterranean. Competing claims to sovereignty over waters rich in hydrocarbon reserves led to a standoff between the Greek and Turkish navy earlier this year, while an agreement in principle to begin dialog has so far failed to materialize.

Disputed Waters

While siding with Greece and Cyprus, the EU is wary of an escalation of tensions with Turkey that would severely harm ties with an important trading partner and with a country upon which the bloc relies to stem Mideast migration.

Highlighting the stakes, Greece may this week demand that Germany cancel a multi-billion dollar deal to sell Turkey advanced attack submarines, arguing such a move risks shifting the balance of power in the entire Mediterranean.

""It was made clear that there must be a reaction against Turkey,"" Greek Foreign Minister Nikolaos Dendias said after the discussion in Brussels.

The quarrel has regional implications, as the deterioration of ties between Turkey and the EU threatens to undermine the already-slim prospects for a resolution of the Cyprus dispute, after almost 50 years of failed attempts to reunify the island.

Crude futures were down 1.9% in New York, with the dollar trading higher and European stock markets declining. It follows a rally last week after OPEC and its allies agreed to add 500,000 barrels a day of output from January to a market that's showing signs of recovery.

In the short-term, there are indications that consumption in Asia remains robust. Saudi Arabia raised oil pricing for the region, a signal the kingdom is confident demand is strong enough to absorb the small boost in supply. China's economy appears robust, with exports rising the most since early 2018 last month to jump more than 20% in dollar terms.

The future path of crude prices now looks to be heavily dependent on how quickly Covid-19 vaccines can be rolled out, with indications most Americans will be able to get one by the second quarter of 2021. OPEC+ is facing more potential supply challenges, however, as Libya continues to ramp up production and as Iran prepares to raise oil exports in a sign the Islamic Republic expects the U.S. to ease some sanctions under a Joe Biden presidency.

The effects of the demand recovery in Asia are also rippling around the world. Rising buying interest from the region has pushed up physical prices for North Sea oil, with Forties crude climbing to the highest level since late August.

Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said last week the country would like to buy from more producers when asked if he would like to see an easing of White House sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. There's also been a rise in inquiries from China about purchasing a sludgy type of oil known as bitumen-mix, thought to be Venezuelan crude passed off as another grade, traders said.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['New York City', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Iran', 'United States', 'Libya', 'Venezuela', 'India', 'China']",Stronger dollar pushes oil prices from nine-month high,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/12/7/stronger-dollar-pushes-oil-prices-from-nine-month-high,None,
11402868,2020-11-27,"(Bloomberg) --Libya's oil industry, trampled by civil war and chaos, is roaring back.

Crude output has surged to nearly 1.25 million barrels a day from almost a dead start in September, thanks to a tentative peace between rival military forces. The OPEC member is already pumping about three-fourths as much as it did before the 2011 uprising that toppled strongman Moammar Al Qaddafi and triggered the country's political and economic collapse.

The speed of the recovery took oil markets by surprise. It's also causing anxiety for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia as they restrict global output to prop up crude prices. Libya is exempt from the cuts and currently supplies more oil than several of its OPEC peers. The so-called OPEC+ alliance is sure to weigh the impact of Libyan oil when it meets next week to assess its strategy as the coronavirus ravages fuel demand in much of the world.

The big unknown about Libya's production -- for traders, analysts and oil minsters alike -- is whether it can be sustained or even increased to pre-conflict levels of around 1.6 million barrels a day. The boost in output over the past two months may have been the easy part. To produce still more crude, the country will need buckets of cash to fix and upgrade its energy infrastructure. That in turn will require a lasting peace and political settlement.

""Libya will likely struggle to produce above 1.3 million barrels a day,"" said Mohammad Darwazah, an analyst at consultant Medley Global Advisors. ""There is not much upside from these levels in the absence of investment.""

Libyan officials have hinted that they won't discuss a potential OPEC quota for the country until it's pumping at least 1.7 million barrels daily. OPEC typically gives any member suffering from conflict several years to recover before trying to cap its output.

Although Libya holds Africa's largest crude reserves, years of strife and lost production have impoverished the government and state-run National Oil Corp. The NOC must repair damage to its oil fields, pumping stations and other facilities, many of which have been idle for years. The lack of routine nuts-and-bolts servicing has left pipelines corroding and storage tanks collapsing. Remedial work at wells alone could cost more than $100 million, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Bloomberg in June.

Sanalla said last month that the country targets pumping 1.6 million barrels a day by the end of 2021. The company has ambitions of eventually supplying more than 2 million barrels daily, an NOC official said to Bloomberg on Thursday, asking not to be identified because the matter isn't public.

To achieve that, the NOC will need more money from oil exports as well as investment from foreign energy partners who pulled out amid the fighting.

International oil companies, including Total SE, Eni SpA and Repsol SA, have stakes in the country. But they'll probably be loath to invest more until they see a durable peace accord and improvements in security. Many of them have withdrawn foreign staff.

In an incident highlighting the security risks Libya continues to face, the headquarters of the NOC itself came under attack in the capital Tripoli on Nov. 23. Armed men tried to storm the building but were stopped by guards.

Libya pumped 80,000 barrels a day in August, the thinnest trickle in nine years. It's now producing on par with Angola. The main reasons for the turnaround: A blockade of many of the country's ports and energy facilities ended in September, and Libya's warring factions signed a permanent cease-fire agreement in October.

Multitrack negotiations, led by the United Nations, are feeding hopes of an end to a conflict in which Turkey has backed the Tripoli-based government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia have supported eastern military leader Khalifa Haftar. The two sides have reached a preliminary agreement to establish a unified government and hold elections within 18 months.

Even so, there's plenty of room for doubt. Previous efforts to broker a lasting peace have faltered, and because the nation's strife has hardened into a proxy war involving regional powers, a lasting political solution also depends on events elsewhere.

The distribution of Libya's oil wealth has been a major sticking point. People in eastern Libya long complained that they received less than their fair share from the Tripoli government based in the west. Their grievance was one of the main reasons for the oil-ports blockade in January; left unresolved, it could once again shatter the country's relative calm.

Institutional infighting poses another risk. In an unprecedented step, the NOC this week said it won't deposit money from crude sales with the central bank, keeping it instead with another lender until rival sides in the country's civil war can reach a long-term political agreement. The NOC accused the central bank of issuing inaccurate data about oil revenue. This seemingly bureaucratic spat hints at a deeper dispute that could complicate efforts to move past the war and threaten Libya's oil recovery.

""As long as the cease-fire holds, and political progress continues to be made, Libyan production will likely remain on the market,"" Darwazah said. But if the NOC's disagreement with the central bank spills over into the political process, he said, ""that would be a warning sign.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Russia', 'Tripoli', 'South Africa', 'Turkey', 'Sweden', 'Egypt', 'Angola', 'United Arab Emirates']",Libya's comeback continues to surprise oil markets,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/27/libya-s-comeback-continues-to-surprise-oil-markets,None,
11402869,2020-11-25,"VIENNA (Bloomberg) --Angela Merkel's district on the Baltic coast was the site of the last major Soviet military project in communist East Germany and is now at the center of a deepening rift between Cold War allies.

Once a critical linchpin in the Soviet Union's power network, the low-lying beachhead near the Polish border has become known as a getaway for Germans, who flock to the island of Ruegen to bike along sandy dunes and dip into its chilly sea.

The European Union's largest infrastructure project was supposed to give one of Germany's poorer regions a path to the modern economy. But geopolitics intervened, with U.S. Congress passing a law that sanctions German companies involved in the Russian gas link. That transatlantic wedge is now threatening to splinter, with potentially costly outcomes to businesses.

No less than ""democracy in Europe"" and the EU's ""image of U.S. companies"" are on the line, a German industrial group warned House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week in a letter. ""The burden on the transatlantic partnership would be immense right at the beginning of Joe Biden's term.""

With broad-based opposition to the 1,239-kilometer (770-mile) pipeline in the U.S., German hopes that the president-elect will reverse sanctions may be misplaced. The friction is contributing to an array of issues fraying ties between Germany and the U.S., pushing Europe to chart its own course.

The fallout of the feud is hitting home in Sassnitz, site of Mukran Port -- dubbed a ""friendship bridge"" to the Soviet Union by East Germany's communist regime. The harbour on Ruegen is the key staging ground for the completion of pipeline, led by Russian gas giant Gazprom. It makes landfall nearby at Lubmin on the mainland, where it's supposed to flow into the European gas grid.

Gas Pipeline Politics

""We've done nothing wrong,"" said Frank Kracht, the mayor of Sassnitz, the biggest shareholder in Mukran, where workers and ships have been idled for months.

The question over whether Nord Stream is completed has focused the attention of investors from Europe's industrial heartlands to the shale fields of Texas. For Germany, it offers critical energy security as the country phases out nuclear and coal power at the same time. For the U.S., there's the risk of Russia gaining leverage over a key ally and the potential loss of a market for American liquefied natural gas.

Merkel has remained true to the controversial project, even as relations with Russia deteriorate. Germany said Monday it's coordinating a response to U.S. sanctions with other EU nations, as well as the companies involved in the project.

""People in Mukran who lived under Soviet authoritarianism are completely surprised by the threats that are now coming from the U.S.,"" said Wolfgang Klietz, the author of a book about the port. ""But the threat of sanctions won't stop the project. They're seen as inappropriate.""

After U.S. sanctions forced western European workers to retreat, Russian vessels have been plying the waters in and around Mukran for months, awaiting orders to install the last remaining sections of pipe. A specialized vessel, the Akademik Cherskiy, killed time by meandering the world's oceans, including rounding the Horn of Africa. It finally arrived in May.

Jutting into an area of the Baltic shared by Denmark, Poland and Sweden, the German base always had strategic value. One of Mukran's special features is the broad-gauge railroad tracks still preferred by Russia. The world's biggest train ferries -- massive ships built to haul railroad boxcars -- ran between Mukran and the Lithuanian port of Klaipedia.

During the last years of the Cold War, the German landing was a waystation for Soviet troops and military equipment, including nuclear weapons. The current dispute has echoes of those past tensions.

While Germany and the U.S. have had high-level policy differences in the past -- most notably over the use of force in places like Iraq and Libya -- this is the first time that disagreement has led to direct sanctions threats against installations in an allied country.

American policy makers have historically opposed European projects that lock-in economic ties to Russia, arguing that payments flowing toward the Kremlin destabilize military alliances. Donald Trump had repeatedly suggested European treachery at play in choosing Russian gas rather than LNG from an ally.

While Washington, former Soviet bloc countries and even some of Germany's European allies say Nord Stream 2 will give Russia too much leverage, the country insists the pipeline is critical and have protested U.S. threats of ""crushing legal and economic sanctions"" against the Baltic Sea port.

Even with the political wrangling, the project shows how deeply integrated the economies of Europe and the U.S are. Austria's Voestalpine AG manufactured the steel for the pipe with the help of its sponge ironwork in Texas -- built in Corpus Christi next to Cheniere Energy, America's biggest LNG exporter.

But U.S. opposition is likely to remain under Biden. ""There's American cross-aisle agreement"" against Nord Stream, Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president and Merkel's former defense minister, told Germany's Die Zeit newspaper earlier this month.

Biden has cautioned against the project in the past. At the Munich Security Conference in 2015, he said the U.S. needs to ""ensure that no country -- not Russia or any other nation -- can use energy as weapon of coercion.""

Amid the stalemate, activity at the Sans Vitesse, a vessel used to house gas and pipeline workers in Mukran, has fallen silent, and locals are feeling their chances of upgrading their economy slipping away.

""With just the threat of sanctions, there can be little doubt that multinational companies with units in the U.S are thinking twice about investments in this region -- stuck as we are in the middle of a global political standoff,"" said Sassnitz Mayor Kracht.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['East Germany', 'Sassnitz', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Lubmin', 'Rügen', 'Vienna', 'Poland', 'Texas', 'Washington (state)', 'Sweden']",German hopes for a U.S. rescue of Nord Stream 2 seem unlikely,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/25/german-hopes-for-a-us-rescue-of-nord-stream-2-seem-unlikely,None,
11402870,2020-11-19,"(Bloomberg) --France's Total SE is in talks to increase energy investment in Libya, where oil output has surged in the past two months amid a truce in the OPEC member's civil war.

Total and Libya's state-run National Oil Corp. held a virtual meeting and discussed efforts to increase Libyan production capacity and output ""to the highest levels,"" the NOC said Thursday. Daily output has already recovered to 1.25 million barrels, it said in a statement, the same amount Libya was producing before it collapsed into political chaos and civil war almost a decade ago.

The speedy resurgence in Libyan oil flows -- it was producing less than 100,000 barrels a day in early September -- has surprised oil traders and exceeded analysts' forecasts. Strife between rival military forces caused a near-total halt in its energy industry in January.

""The NOC and its companies, even during the shutdown, have not and will not stop working hard,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said. ""This explains the rapid return to previous production rates.""

Total has been active in Libya for decades and holds shares in key oil fields, including the nation's biggest -- Sharara -- and the offshore Al Jurf deposit. The Paris-based company also has a share in the Mabruk field, which has been closed for years because of political upheaval.

The North African country was producing 1.6 million barrels a day before a 2011 uprising toppled long-time dictator Muammar Qaddafi and led to civil war. Oil facilities have been caught up in the conflict, making Libya -- home to the continent's largest crude reserves -- an uncommonly volatile producer.

The nation was producing about 1.2 million barrels a day before Khalifa Haftar, a Russian-backed commander based in eastern Libya, blockaded ports and fields in January. Haftar, who was battling the United Nations-recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj, lifted his blockade in September after winding down hostilities amid a truce.

Libya's recovery is weighing on oil prices at a time when the coronavirus is sapping energy demand. At the same time, analysts and traders question whether the revival will last and if the truce can hold.

In what could be a big step toward stabilizing Libyan oil output and exports, Sanalla traveled to the eastern port of Brega this week to meet with the two main warring factions and discuss unifying the Petroleum Facilities Guard. The Guard was formed as a neutral force to defend oil ports and fields, but its members contributed to a crash in output in recent years by blockading installations on behalf of various groups and to press their own demands.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Sweden', 'France', 'Brega']",Total in talks with Libya to expand oilfield investment,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/19/total-in-talks-with-libya-to-expand-oilfield-investment,None,
11402871,2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg) --As OPEC+ began talks on whether to postpone January's oil-production increase, ministers sounded cautious about the strength of global demand.

Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said he could see a light at the end of the tunnel thanks to the development of Covid-19 vaccines, but the market had some way to go before getting there. His counterparts from Algeria and Russia talked about bumps in the road and an uncertain winter, adding to the impression that the group is open to considering a delay.

""There has been very good news of possible vaccines against the Covid-19 virus, allowing us to see some glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel,"" Prince Abdulaziz said at the opening session of an OPEC+ video conference on Tuesday. ""But the good news was counterbalanced by a surge in cases in the second wave of infections.""

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are considering whether to postpone a 2 million barrel-a-day production increase scheduled for January by between three and six months. The online talks of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee could make a recommendation, but the final decision won't come until a full OPEC+ meeting on Nov. 30 to Dec. 1.

In addition to the medical breakthroughs, signs of a strong demand recovery in Asia are giving cause for optimism, said Prince Abdulaziz. Yet he also emphasized the negative impact of another round of lockdowns in Europe and the supply increase from Libya.

""The world has a better understanding of how to fight the pandemic, new restrictions have a milder effect on demand and we see a significant progress in development of vaccines,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. ""We need to continue showing commitment to our obligations, taking into account today's uncertainties and the market situation amid winter demand.""

While crude prices rallied to $45 a barrel in London last week following news of a breakthrough on a Covid-19 vaccine, they remain far lower than most OPEC nations need to cover government spending. There's also a risk that oil demand will remain depressed for many months during the slow rollout of vaccines.

""There is still a way to go before we reach the other side of the long-awaited pandemic tunnel,"" Prince Abdulaziz said.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Russia', 'Algeria', 'Libya', 'London']",OPEC+ ministers warn of continued oil demand fragility,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/17/opecplus-ministers-warn-of-continued-oil-demand-fragility,None,
11402872,2020-11-16,"(Bloomberg) --Oil markets may be cheering the prospects of a coronavirus vaccine, but OPEC+ can't celebrate.

Crude prices have rallied to a 10-week high on hopes that Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE's breakthrough could soon revive the flights, car journeys and other economic activity that underpin fuel consumption.

Nonetheless, the alliance of producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia is discussing a delay of the supply boost they'd hoped to make in January. Oil demand is currently suffering a fresh blow from a resurgence of the pandemic.

Ministers are focused on a postponement of three to six months, according to delegates familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified. They'll hold an interim meeting on Tuesday to review the market, then make a final decision in a further two weeks.

Frightening Pullback

""This is the wrong time to be increasing crude supply,"" Bob McNally, president of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official, said in a Bloomberg television interview. ""They really almost have no choice now but to postpone. The demand pullback in Europe is frightening.""

While the vaccine progress relieves some of the pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, it won't provide a significant boost to demand until the second half of 2021 next year, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. Economic fallout from the latest wave of lockdowns will linger, OPEC said in a report.

The 23-nation alliance had intended to ease some of the unprecedented supply curbs introduced in May to offset the collapse in demand, restoring 2 million barrels a day of output at the start of next year. They made a similar increase over the summer as the global economy recovered, and hoped that the trend would continue.

But in recent weeks OPEC+ members have acknowledged those aspirations look unfeasible. Instead, the producers look set to keep about 7.7 million barrels a day -- roughly 8% of global supply -- off-line for a little longer.

Critical Cut

Deferring the supply boost -- and thus supporting prices -- may be critical for OPEC+ nations, many of which need oil prices far above the current level of $43 a barrel in order to cover government spending. It would also throw a lifeline to the wider industry, from majors like Exxon Mobil Corp. to independent companies in the U.S. shale patch.

Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman said on Nov. 9 the producers can ""tweak this agreement"" as required. Algeria, which holds OPEC's rotating presidency, and group Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo made similar remarks.

Even Russia, usually reluctant to forego oil sales, has signaled support. President Vladimir Putin said on Oct. 22 that delay was an option, and even gestured at the possibility of making deeper production cuts if necessary. Further curbs don't appear needed so far, delegates say.

""The lockdowns in Europe and what that will mean for demand will be very much on their mind,"" Daniel Yergin, vice chairman at IHS Markit, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""The easiest thing for them to do, and as President Putin signaled, is to roll it over.""

While the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee that convenes on Tuesday won't set policy, Riyadh and Moscow may give some insight into their thinking before the main ministerial meetings on Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. Updates on the different vaccines under development by pharmaceutical companies are expected in the meantime.

Supply Headache

Faltering demand isn't the only headache for the alliance, which is also having to reckon with a surprising increase in supply from one of its own members.

Libya, which is exempt from the agreement to restrain production, has revived output to the highest level in almost a year after a truce in its civil war. The North African nation tripled supply to 450,000 barrels a day last month, and is now pumping above 1 million a day.

The case for extending curbs, though persuasive, could still run into opposition.

The United Arab Emirates, which has recently chafed at its OPEC commitments, emphasized on Nov. 9 that consensus is necessary for the deal to be amended. ""We have to be all convinced that tweak is required,"" Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said.

One flash-point may be the millions of barrels of outstanding cuts still due from some members, which were supposed to be completed by the end of the year.

OPEC+ nations that flouted their output quotas in the initial months of the agreement, such as Iraq and Nigeria, have been tasked with ""compensation cuts."" After making some tentative efforts at these, Baghdad defiantly ramped exports back up last month.

Iraq has often rebelled against OPEC-mandated supply limits as it rebuilds an oil industry and economy scarred by decades of conflict and sanctions.

As Baghdad's finances come under acute distress, OPEC delegates doubt the country will make further efforts to atone. With Saudi Arabia's steely energy minister determined that all remaining debts are paid, the group may face a bumpy path to a final agreement.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Sweden', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Paris', 'Moscow', 'Riyadh', 'United States', 'Libya', 'Algeria', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Baghdad', 'Nigeria', 'Iraq']",Vaccine news alone won't solve OPEC's oil output puzzle,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/16/vaccine-news-alone-won-t-solve-opec-s-oil-output-puzzle,None,
11402873,2020-11-13,"(Bloomberg) --Oil fell for a second day -- dropping below $41 a barrel in New York -- as the ongoing spread of coronavirus dampens the demand outlook.

As well as the surge in European coronavirus cases, there are also growing numbers in the U.S., Japan and South Korea, all of which are major oil consumers. The International Energy Agency and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries revised down their demand forecasts this week.

At the same time, supply is rising as Libya opens the taps. The country's production rose to 1.145 million barrels a day on Friday, according to a spokesman for its state-run National Oil Corp.

Crude is still up more than 8% this week, however, after news of a potential Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough spurred a sharp jump in global markets on Monday. Futures have also been supported by indications that the OPEC+ alliance is closing in on a deal to delay a planned easing of output cuts. Still, three of the world's top central bankers warned that a vaccine wouldn't be enough to put an end to the economic challenges created by the pandemic as it continues to stymie consumption in some parts.

""There is a clear divergence in the oil demand recovery between Asia and Europe,"" said Kevin Solomon, an analyst at brokerage StoneX Group. ""We can assume that tighter lockdowns will resume in the United States, ultimately crimping oil demand.""

Prices:

In Asia, refiners are having to outbid one another to secure supplies in the spot market as buying interest from Chinese refiners grows. Meanwhile in Europe, where motorway traffic is down by almost 50% in some countries, demand is stuttering anew. That's impacting crude, with six supertankers of unwanted North Sea oil continuing to float in the region.

Passive oil investors are also taking a more circumspect view on oil in the short term. More than $460 million has been pulled from the market's largest exchange-traded funds so far this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",World Oil Online,energy,,[],Oil prices fall for second day as virus case count surges,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/13/oil-prices-fall-for-second-day-as-virus-case-count-surges,None,
11402874,2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg) --Talks between OPEC and its allies are zeroing in on a delay to next year's planned oil-output increase of three to six months, according to several delegates.

Saudi Arabia and Russia, leaders of the 23-nation coalition, have already indicated publicly that they are thinking twice about easing production cuts in January as the resurgent pandemic hits fuel demand.

The presidents of both Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have even mentioned the option of cutting production deeper. This idea hasn't garnered widespread support so far among other members, one delegate said.

Less than three weeks before members meet to take a final decision, the alliance is instead increasingly focused on maintaining the current cutbacks into early 2021, the delegates said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. The alliance is keeping about 7.7 million barrels a day off-line right now, or 8% of global output.

Vaccine Surprise

The vaccine announced this week by Pfizer Inc. could revive fuel demand in mid-2021, allaying the need to pare supply further, one delegate said. Oil prices rallied to a 10-week high above $45 a barrel in London on Wednesday in response to the scientific breakthrough.

However, the immense logistical challenges of deploying a vaccine to billions of people mean it won't materially alter oil-market conditions over the next six months, a delegate said. So the development doesn't guarantee that producers can open the taps in January as originally planned.

OPEC is also having to contend with the return of supply from members that are exempt from cutting production. After a truce in its civil war, Libya has revived output to the highest level in almost a year. Traders expect Iran will resume exports in 2021 after President-Elect Joe Biden reactivates an accord on the country's nuclear program.

Deal Tweaks

Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Monday that OPEC and its partners can ""tweak this agreement"" as necessary.

It already did so earlier this year, postponing a 2 million barrel-a-day output hike from July to August. The cartel had aimed to restore a similar amount of production in January, in expectation that a rebounding global economy would stimulate fuel use.

But a surge of infections is triggering new lockdowns, sapping demand for transport fuels and making those hopes less feasible. The monthly report from OPEC's Vienna-based secretariat cut projections for the amount of crude the world will need from the cartel for almost every quarter to the end of 2021. It warned the pandemic's effects on consumption will ""linger"" next year.

Since OPEC+ forged the current production agreement back in April, Riyadh and Moscow have consistently tried to shape expectations. They have, on occasion, opted for more aggressive measures than the market was expecting, keeping the moves under wraps to maximize the impact on prices.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Oct. 22 that ""if necessary we can take a decision on further cuts,"" while adding that he saw no immediate need to do so. Algerian Energy Minister Abdelmajid Attar alluded to the possibility again on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia's Prince Abdulaziz has warned repeatedly that it would be unwise for short sellers to bet against him.

Nothing is certain until ministers hold an online meeting from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1. The United Arab Emirates, which has recently chafed at its OPEC commitments, emphasized on Monday that consensus is necessary for the deal to be amended.

11402875,2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg) --The International Energy Agency cut forecasts for global oil demand amid new lockdown measures and cautioned that the vaccine breakthrough won't quickly revive markets.

While crude prices rallied to a 10-week high above $45 in London this week on news of Pfizer Inc.'s progress, fuel use won't experience any ""significant"" boost from vaccines until the second half of next year, the agency said.

The Paris-based IEA, which advises most major economies, reduced oil-demand projections for this quarter sharply, by 1.2 million barrels a day.

Brent crude steadied on Thursday after three days of gains, and was unchanged at $43.80 at 10:39 a.m. London time.

The faltering outlook for consumption, combined with rising supply in places like Libya, puts pressure on the OPEC cartel and its allies as they prepare to meet in just under three weeks, the agency said.

The OPEC+ alliance led by Saudi Arabia and Russia had initially aimed to restore some of the supply they're keeping offline at the start of next year, but is increasingly focused on delaying the move.

""With a Covid-19 vaccine unlikely to ride to the rescue of the global oil market for some time, the combination of weaker demand and rising oil supply provide a difficult backdrop"" to the meeting, the IEA said in its monthly report. ""Unless the fundamentals change, the task of rebalancing the market will make slow progress.""

Swollen Stockpiles

If OPEC+ does proceed with its scheduled supply increase of almost 2 million barrels a day in January, the producers will fail to deplete global oil inventories during the first quarter, the agency said. Bringing stockpiles, swollen by this year's demand collapse, back to normal levels has been one of the coalition's key goals.

Data now available for the third quarter suggest that inventories fell by barely a third of the expected amount, declining by 800,000 barrels a day, the IEA said.

Global oil consumption is on track to slump by an unprecedented 8.8 million barrels a day this year, averaging 91.3 million a day, according to the IEA. It also trimmed estimates for 2021, lowering its first-quarter projection by 700,000 barrels a day, though demand is still set to stage a rebound of 5.8 million barrels on average next year.

Besides the challenge of deteriorating demand, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also has to reckon with a surprising rebound in supply. World output could be 1 million barrels a day higher this month as the U.S. recovers from hurricane disruptions and as Libya resumes exports, the agency said.

Libya, one of the three OPEC nations exempt from the agreement to restrain output, tripled production to 450,000 barrels a day last month as its political tumult abated, the IEA said. It's now pumping more than 1 million barrels a day, and could average just below this level in November, the agency predicted.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['London', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Libya']",IEA cuts oil demand outlook on concerns over vaccine's impact,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/12/iea-cuts-oil-demand-outlook-on-concerns-over-vaccine-s-impact,None,
11402876,2020-11-11,"(Bloomberg) --Libya boosted oil output to more than 1.1 million barrels a day, inching closer to the level it was producing at before the country's civil war all but shut down its energy industry in January.

The OPEC member, home to Africa's largest crude reserves, ramped up production as output at its biggest oil fields including Sharara and Waha increased, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public. It's the first time Libya has reached this landmark since early January.

The nation was producing about 1.2 million barrels a day before its energy sector was mostly shuttered that month when Khalifa Haftar, a Russian-backed commander based in the east, blockaded ports and fields. Haftar, who was battling the United Nations-recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, lifted his blockade in mid-September after winding down hostilities in June.

The additional Libyan barrels are an unwelcome challenge for OPEC+, the coalition of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers such as Russia. The group was set to increase output by almost 2 million barrels a day in January as part of a plan to ease the cuts that began in May at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It may be forced into a delay with crude prices under pressure.

Brent crude rose on Wednesday to $45 a barrel in London for the first time in 10 weeks as an apparent drop in U.S. crude stockpiles added to an earlier rally driven by a virus vaccine breakthrough. Even so, the benchmark is around 32% lower this year.

Libya's resurgence -- it was producing less than 100,000 barrels a day in early September -- has taken oil traders by surprise just as renewed coronavirus lockdowns in Europe and accelerating cases in the U.S. stifle energy use. The country aims to pump 1.3 million barrels a day by the beginning of 2021, National Oil Corp. Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in an Oct. 31 interview.

Production is reviving as Libya's warring sides started talks this week on charting a path to elections and a unity government. The discussions in neighboring Tunisia were launched after military leaders from the Tripoli-based government and their eastern rivals reached a permanent cease-fire and agreed to work toward the withdrawal of foreign fighters. The country's comparative period of calm has allowed the NOC to lift force majeure at its facilities and restart crude production nationwide.

The talks are part of a broader effort spearheaded by the United Nations in a push to end nearly a decade of strife that has ravaged the North African oil exporter.

""Once again, NOC and its partners have surprised markets with the speed at which they can restore shut-in oil production,"" said Bill-Farren Price, a director at London-based research firm Enverus.

""So far the signs are good, and it appears Libya has turned a corner,"" he said.

11402878,2020-11-09,"(Bloomberg) --Libya boosted oil production to more than 1 million barrels a day, a milestone for the North African country after civil war all but shut its energy industry.

The OPEC member, home to Africa's largest crude reserves, ramped up production in the past six weeks amid a truce between rival military forces. It was pumping 800,000 barrels a day last week, and the state-run National Oil Corp. said Saturday that output now exceeds the million-barrel level. That's the first time the landmark has been reached since early January.

Libya's resurgence -- it was producing less than 100,000 barrels a day in early September -- has taken oil traders by surprise and weakened prices just as renewed coronavirus lockdowns in Europe and accelerating cases in the U.S. stifle energy use.

The speed of Libya's oil recovery is a ""huge achievement,"" the NOC said in a statement. Still, the company faces ""very big financial difficulties,"" which will make it tough to fix dilapidated and damaged oil facilities.

Daily output at the western field of Sharara, Libya's biggest, declined to 175,000 barrels on Saturday from 250,000 because a control station was closed following a pipeline leak, according to a person familiar with the matter. Oil workers have started to repair the pipeline but don't yet know how long it will take, the person said.

The NOC also warned it might not be able to sustain current levels of production because ""some entities"" were trying to hinder its efforts. While Libya's warring sides are meeting this month to appoint a unity government, there's still plenty of disagreement between them and no guarantee they'll strike a permanent peace deal.

The extra Libyan barrels are an unwelcome complication for OPEC+, a coalition of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers such as Russia. The group was set to increase output by almost 2 million barrels a day in January -- part of a plan to ease cuts that began in May at the height of the pandemic. But it may be forced into a delay with crude prices under pressure again.

Libya aims to pump 1.3 million barrels a day by the beginning of 2021, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in an Oct. 31 interview. Although the Arab nation's strife exempted it from the OPEC+ supply curbs, it will coordinate with other members, Sanalla said. So far, there's been no suggestion from the group that Libya should lose its exemption.

The country's energy sector was mostly shuttered in mid-January when Khalifa Haftar, a Russian-backed commander based in the east, blockaded ports and fields. Haftar, who was battling the United Nations-recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, lifted his blockade in mid-September after winding down hostilities in June.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Russia']",Libya passes 1 million barrel per day oil production milestone,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/9/libya-passes-1-million-barrel-per-day-oil-production-milestone,None,
11402879,2020-11-02,"(Bloomberg) --A sharp drop in oil prices may be about to get some relief from China.

Against a backdrop of sagging demand and signs of growing supply, the world's biggest oil buyer raised the quota for use of overseas oil by non-state entities next year by more than 20% versus 2020, according to an announcement from the Ministry of Commerce.

The increase in the import quota is equivalent to about 823,000 barrels a day, which is slightly less than the amount that OPEC member Algeria pumps. The firms that'll use the oil include private refiners, known as teapots, which have become increasingly important in the global oil market in recent years. Those companies have been running their plants at a higher utilization rate than a year ago for many months already, while their counterparts in the U.S. and Europe lag behind.

The increased allocation signals oil purchases from the world's biggest importing nation will be even stronger at a time when global demand faces new headwinds from more restrictions and lockdowns as coronavirus infections spread again in Europe and the U.S. The worsening demand outlook coupled with fresh supply in Libya has weighed on benchmark prices, pulling West Texas Intermediate down as much as 6% earlier Monday. As of 7:29 a.m. New York local time, crude was 2.4% lower at $34.93 a barrel.

Behind the boost to imports is China's ambitious capacity expansion. The country's brand-new, mega-refiner Zhejiang Petrochemical started up one of its new 200,000-barrel-per-day crude distillation units on Sunday, the company's parent said in an exchange filing. Another, Chinese independent refinery Shenghong Petrochemical Group, is working on building the country's single largest crude unit, which is scheduled to start up by the end of next year.

Oil traders have been buying up cargoes since early October and sending them toward China, hoping to capitalize on an expected surge in demand at the end of the year when independent refineries there get the import licenses for 2021.

The country set crude import quotas for non-state companies at 243 million tons, according to the ministry statement. That's equivalent to 4.9 million barrels a day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China kept the annual quota unchanged at 202 million tons for this year, after a stunning increase of over 1 million barrels a day for 2019 versus the prior year.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['China', 'United States', 'Algeria', 'New York City', 'Zhejiang', 'Libya']",China raises oil quota 20 percent to leverage low oil prices,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/11/2/china-raises-oil-quota-20-percent-to-leverage-low-oil-prices,None,

There were also talks about potentially deepening the current OPEC+ cuts, but that was not considered to be the base case, said one person. The main focus was a possible delay, the people said.

OPEC+, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, was already considering postponing the supply increase planned for January as oil prices faltered. President Vladimir Putin said last week he was open to a delay, and since then the outlook has worsened as France, Germany and the UK go back into coronavirus lockdown.

Oil slumped 10% in London last week as traders anticipated lower oil demand, just as additional supplies from Libya hit the market. That's below the level needed to cover the budget of the government in Moscow.

Brent crude pared earlier losses of as much as 4.6%, trading 0.5% higher at $37.65 a barrel at 1:27 p.m. in London.

Russian companies are contributing the biggest tranche of production cuts after Saudi Arabia, so any change to the terms of the agreement between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies requires their cooperation.

11402881,2020-11-02,"(Bloomberg) --Oil clawed back earlier losses amid signals that a key OPEC ally is in discussions about possibly postponing the group's planned output hike in January.

Futures were higher in New York, after earlier falling to a five-month low. Discussions between Russian oil companies and Energy Minister Alexander Novak over the possibility of delaying a planned OPEC+ output bolster optimism the group won't add more supply than the market can absorb as Europe enters a new round of lockdowns. At the same time, China increased the 2021 private-firms import quota by more than 20% compared to this year, presenting a bright spot for an otherwise precarious demand picture.

Uneven global demand and a looming U.S. election is ""creating overall uncertainty,"" said Gary Cunningham, director of account management and research at Tradition Energy. Yet, the discussions in Russia show ""a willingness by the OPEC+ conglomerate to help support the market.""

Futures had earlier come under pressure from the double whammy of rising Libyan supply and a dwindling demand outlook as England joined the string of European countries to renew lockdowns. That could be just the curtain-raiser for a turbulent week of trading as Americans head to the polls Tuesday in an election that could reshape U.S. policy on everything from fiscal stimulus to Iran and fracking.

OPEC+ faces an increasingly complicated decision on whether to add more supply to the market when the group meets at the end of the month. New threats to the fragile demand recovery coupled with fresh supply have spurred oil futures to take back their meager summer gains. The second wave of the virus around the world could push global oil demand to as low 88 to 89 million barrels a day, down 11% or 12% from last year, Trafigura Group boss Jeremy Weir said at a conference.

""Positive supply developments in Libya will only raise the probability that the OPEC+ group will explicitly consider a delay to the taper of its planned voluntary output cuts,"" said BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that England would join other countries in western Europe in imposing tougher restrictions to fight the spread of Covid-19. Trafigura Group boss Jeremy Weir said the second wave of the virus around the world could push global oil demand to as low 88 to 89 million barrels a day, down 11% or 12% from last year.

In Libya, the pace of the production recovery continues to surprise traders and create a headache for the OPEC+ alliance. Daily output has reached 800,000 barrels and the country is targeting 1.3 million by the beginning of 2021, said Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of state-run National Oil Corp. That compares with just 100,000 barrels a day in early September.

The worsening demand outlook coupled with fresh supply has pushed U.S. crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate down around 16% from its close on Oct. 20. It leaves OPEC+ with an ever trickier task as it decides whether to add more supplies to the market.

""The recovery in global oil demand has slowed significantly,"" said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of Asia oil at FGE. ""Crude prices will continue to be pressured by bearish demand data and headlines in the coming weeks.""

Soft Structure

Crude's slump at the open on Monday pressured the market's structure. WTI's nearest contract traded at its biggest discount to the next month since September, a sign that concerns are growing about oversupply. The cost of bearish put options is at its highest relative to bullish calls since May.

The reopening of the last of Libya's oil fields and ports has prompted a resurgence of the energy industry, with the OPEC nation's daily production jumping from less than 100,000 barrels in early September.

""We're very interested in coordinating with our colleagues in OPEC,"" Sanalla said in an interview Saturday. ""We're interested in achieving a balance in terms of supply and demand."" Libya's share in OPEC is 1.7 million barrels daily.

The National Oil Corp. expects the country to pump 1 million barrels daily next month, Sanalla said. Its ambition to reach 1.6 million by the end of 2021 hinges on the resources the Finance Ministry will allocate to the company, he said.

Germany and France, the European Union's two biggest economies, will clamp down on movement for at least a month to try and curb Covid-19's spread. There are already signs that road use in Europe is slumping, weighing on oil consumption.

As the impact of the virus rears its head across markets once again, oil is also contending with supply issues too. American crude inventories rose the most since July last week, while Libya output is also gaining rapidly. The head of Saudi Aramco's trading unit warned there may not be enough demand to absorb the planned OPEC+ supply increase in January.

""The recovery of oil demand in Europe has stalled in recent weeks,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Group AG. ""We previously forecast the oil market to be in deficit in 4Q. It now will likely be balanced and might even flip into oversupplied in November and December.""

Germany is proposing widespread curbs for a month, while France is preparing tougher restrictions that may include a lockdown in the latest round of measures to limit the spread of Covid-19. That weighed on European and U.S. equity markets, while the dollar was stronger, souring oil market sentiment.

Adding to the gloom, the American Petroleum Institute reported crude inventories expanded by 4.58 million barrels last week, while gasoline stockpiles rose for a second straight week, according to people familiar with the data. Official government figures are due later on Wednesday.

Crude has come under renewed pressure as the virus leads to a more fragile demand outlook, and the head of Saudi Aramco's trading unit said traders are cautious given the uncertainty in consumption. The market is also facing rising supply from Libya, which is eroding some of the stock draws that were expected in the fourth quarter. It means OPEC+ has some tough decisions to make on the path forward for its output curbs next month.

""With hefty stock builds across the board in the headline API numbers, it is not all that surprising the oil price is moving lower this morning,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, oil strategist at BNP Paribas SA.

At the same time, stock markets fell as investors doubted that Washington lawmakers will reach an economic stimulus package anytime soon.

The worsening demand outlook is coinciding with Libya's push to almost double crude output, as it reopened its last major oil field. The nation's production could top 1 million barrels a day within weeks.

A little more than six months after Covid-19 sent oil prices into a tailspin, a second wave is threatening to take another bite out of energy demand. Saudi Arabia's energy minister said at a conference on Monday that the oil market isn't yet out of the woods, despite a strong recovery in recent months.

Oil dropped after the state energy firm lifted force majeure on exports from El Feel on Monday. The move will bolster the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp.'s attempt to boost Libyan production to 1 million barrels each day within a month.

The return of Libyan barrels is hindering OPEC+ as it tries to prop up crude prices amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases and with many major economies imposing lockdowns again. The oil producers' alliance was set to ease supply cuts by almost 2 million barrels a day in January, but may be forced into a delay.

Crude production from Libya's western deposit of El Feel, or Elephant in Arabic, will reach normal rates of around 70,000 barrels daily within a few days, the NOC said. Force majeure is a clause in contracts allowing deliveries to be suspended.

Monday marks ""the end of closures at all Libyan oil fields and ports,"" the NOC said.

Libya's output has risen rapidly over the past six weeks after Khalifa Haftar, a commander in the long-running war, ended a blockade of most energy facilities started in January. His representatives agreed a permanent truce with the United Nations-recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj on Friday. The two sides are set to meet in Tunisia next month to appoint a unity government.

While Libya has been in chaos since a 2011 revolt that overthrew former dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi, its oil industry has proved resilient. A rise in production from mid-2016 proved more sustainable than many traders expected, with the country's output averaging around 1 million barrels a day in both 2018 and 2019.

The speed of the latest recovery has again taken markets by surprise and put pressure on oil prices, which have been hammered since the virus spread around the world. Brent crude dropped 1.8% to $41.06 per barrel as of 10:45 a.m. in London, deepening its fall this year to 38%.

Libya's daily output has risen to 560,000 barrels from less than 100,000 in early September. Sharara, the country's biggest field, reopened around two weeks ago, while the last two oil ports still closed -- Ras Lanuf and Es Sider -- restarted on Friday.

The Arab nation won't be able to pump at December's levels of around 1.2 million barrels a day due to damaged infrastructure and budget constraints, according to the NOC. The war has damaged storage tanks, pipelines and well heads, and it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to fix them properly, the NOC has said.

Libya is home to Africa's largest oil reserves. Due to its strife, it was exempted from supply cuts agreed by OPEC+ -- a partnership of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others such as Russia -- in April at the height of the pandemic. The group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, initially cut output by 10 million barrels a day, roughly a 10th of global production.

Crude futures fell as much as 2.2% in New York, extending a weekly decline. Libya has lifted force majeure on its Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports and oil output will surpass 1 million barrels a day in four weeks, according to the state-run National Oil Corp. The announcement comes after warring parties in the North African county signed a permanent cease-fire agreement.

Prices were already edging lower after White House economic director Larry Kudlow said ""the ball's not moving much right now"" on talks over another round of virus aid, though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC that a pre-election stimulus bill can still be passed if President Donald Trump cooperates. Meanwhile, the pandemic continues to worsen, with curfews widening in Europe amid fresh outbreaks and the U.S. case count topping 70,000 for the first time since late July.

""The apparent nationwide ceasefire in Libya is only going to encourage more production there and keep it steady, at least for a while,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC. Meanwhile, ""the Covid situation is not really improving, if not getting worse. So, we're continuing to deal with that as well.""

With futures stuck below $40/bbl, attention is turning to the next major events on the horizon: the U.S. election and an OPEC+ meeting at the end of next month. On Thursday, Russia indicated for the first time that it's open to delaying an oil-output hike planned for January. At the same time, the unexpected return of Libyan output adds another complicating factor for the group's next move. Meanwhile, American presidential candidate Joe Biden said fossil fuels need phasing out over time, a comment seized on by Donald Trump as a threat to the industry.

""However, two crucial events -- namely the U.S. elections on Nov. 3 as well as the OPEC+ meeting at the end of November -- may cause the oil market to move significantly in the coming weeks.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'United States', 'Russia']",Oil declines further with Libyan output set to rise coming weeks,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/10/23/oil-declines-further-with-libyan-output-set-to-rise-coming-weeks,None,
11402889,2020-10-23,"(Bloomberg) --Warring parties in Libya have reached a permanent cease-fire agreement across the entire country, the United Nations said.

The rivals had planned to continue military talks in Geneva until Oct. 24, one of three tracks being pursued with the aim of ending nearly a decade of conflict in the OPEC member.

Libya has been wracked by violence since a NATO-backed revolt ousted leader Muammar al-Qaddafi in 2011. Repeated previous efforts over recent years to broker a lasting agreement between Fayez al-Sarraj's government and eastern commander Khalifa Haftar had faltered.

""The 5+5 Joint Military Commission talks in Geneva today culminated in a historic achievement where Libyan parties reached a permanent ceasefire agreement,"" according to a statement by the UN Support Mission in Libya. ""This achievement marks an important turning point towards achieving peace and stability in Libya.""

A blockade of many of the country's energy facilities ended last month, and the state energy firm has been ramping up production faster than many analysts expected.

Output reached 560,000 barrels a day on Wednesday, a person with knowledge of the matter said, up from 150,000 in September. If the truce sticks, production could reach 1 million barrels a day by March, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Before the shutdowns in January, Libya had ambitious plans to raise output to 1.5 million barrels a day this year and more than 2 million by 2024. Those targets look more challenging now, given the dilapidated state of the nation's oil infrastructure.

Still, further increases in Libyan production are sure to rattle OPEC and its allies such as Russia and Mexico. In light of the country's civil war, OPEC+ exempted it from supply cuts that the coalition enacted in May to boost oil prices.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Geneva', 'Russia', 'Mexico']",UN says Libya reaches permanent cease-fire deal,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/10/23/un-says-libya-reaches-permanent-cease-fire-deal,None,
11402890,2020-10-19,"(Bloomberg) --When OPEC and its allies met last month, Saudi Arabia's energy minister dared oil speculators to test his determination to stabilize global markets.

Now that a resurgent pandemic is threatening demand once again, the moment of reckoning is getting closer.

The coalition of crude producers will hold a video conference at 3:30 p.m. Vienna time to assess the state of the market. No supply decisions are expected until Dec. 1, but leading members Saudi Arabia and Russia are already stepping up diplomacy.

President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman have spoken twice by phone in a week -- the first time the countries' leaders have done that since the depths of the oil crisis in April, when they were hashing out a deal to cut supply and bring the price war to an end. The calls have been necessary to stay abreast of constant changes in the market, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.

With oil stuck at around $40, and more supply coming online from Libya, the cartel is now under pressure to revise its plan to ease those output cuts. It has already relaxed them by about 2 million barrels a day, and is due to add another 1.9 million in January.

While members are publicly sticking with that plan for now, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo acknowledged on Thursday that demand is ""anemic"" and the cartel will act to prevent a market ""relapse."" Its own internal reports points to the risk of a new surplus. And in private, delegates admit they're open to delaying the increase when a formal decision is taken in six weeks.

Influential voices in the market are already telling OPEC+ to be wary about the planned increase.

Trading houses like Mercuria Energy Group, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and institutions such as the International Energy Agency are counseling that markets remain too fragile to easily absorb the additional barrels.

""Adding oil to the market at such a time is not an advisable gambit,"" said Natasha Kaneva, an analyst at JPMorgan in New York.

These views may be considered during Monday's online session of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, chaired by Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak. The panel won't decide on next year's supply, which will be finalized at the larger ministerial meetings on Nov. 30-Dec. 1.

It's a decision that will have profound implications not just for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- many of whose member nations need prices significantly above current levels to cover government spending -- but also the wider industry, from shale drillers to majors like Exxon Mobil Corp.

Glimmer of Hope

There have been glimmers of hope for oil prices recently that producers must take care not to snuff out.

Global oil demand has recovered to 94% of pre-pandemic levels, depleting the world's bloated inventories, the International Energy Agency estimates. Buyers in China, the world's second-biggest consumer, are set to boost purchases after slowing down over the summer. Indian refiners are cranking up operations before the nation's two main festivals.

Stronger consumption from the two Asian behemoths will play a big part in the final decision in December. Ministers will also consider data from other parts of the world as the virus spreads, and the result of the U.S. presidential elections in early November.

But a full return to prior levels of demand will take a couple of years, particularly for jet fuel, trading houses like Vitol Group and Trafigura Group predict. OPEC+ also needs to keep whittling away global stockpiles to avoid another glut and a plunge in prices.

If the group ""adds production as scheduled in January, then we will not draw crude stocks anymore,"" Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive officer of trading house Gunvor Group Ltd., said in an interview.

Libyan Surge

Another reason to postpone the increase has emerged recently as Libya, exempted from the effort to restrain supply, restores output.

The OPEC nation has boosted production five-fold in just a few weeks after a military commander allowed ports to reopen. It's now pumping 500,000 barrels a day following the restart of its biggest oilfield, and the IEA estimates another 200,000 a day could be added by the end of the year.

Resurgent

An internal report presented at an OPEC+ technical committee last week showed the group is aware of the dangers. While its central scenario predicted that global oil stockpiles will decline by 1.9 million barrels a day next year, it cautioned that if Covid-19 hits demand harder than expected and Libya stages a strong recovery, inventories could instead accumulate slightly.

Delaying the planned output taper would bring its own complications, however, as countries would have to forsake the revenue additional production could bring.

Another issue will be clearing the backlog of compensatory supply cuts that nations like Iraq and Nigeria owe in return for flouting quotas in the initial months of the agreement. Saudi Arabia and Russia have urged fellow members to respect their output commitments as oil prices come under renewed pressure.

""Right now, when demand is fragile and Covid-19 cases are resurging, all the producers have an incentive to work together,"" said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Vienna', 'United States', 'India', 'China', 'Nigeria', 'Iraq']",Pressures from inside and outside OPEC+ compel a new production plan,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/10/19/pressures-from-inside-and-outside-opecplus-compel-a-new-production-plan,None,
11402891,2020-10-16,"(Bloomberg) - Libya's daily oil production has risen to around 500,000 barrels, according to people familiar with the situation, as the war-battered nation restarts its energy industry after a truce.

Sharara, the country's biggest oil field, is pumping roughly 110,000 barrels a day, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak to media. The southwestern deposit, which has a capacity of 300,000 barrels daily, restarted on Sunday.

Brent crude fell following the news but later pared some losses. The international benchmark was 0.6% lower late Thursday at $43.06 a barrel.

The halt in Libya's civil war led to many fields and ports in the east reopening last month, after an almost total shutdown of energy facilities since January. Before then, Libya was producing 1.2 million barrels a day.

Libya is home to Africa's largest crude reserves and the return of its barrels is weighing on oil prices just as tighter virus restrictions in many countries sap demand for energy. The North African nation is an OPEC+ member, though it's exempt from supply curbs the cartel initiated in May to boost oil prices, which are down around 35% this year.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecasts that Libyan output could hit 1 million barrels a day by March, though that will depend on the truce holding.

Libya's oil exports averaged 385,000 barrels daily in the first two weeks of this month, up from 213,000 barrels a day for all of September, according to tanker-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg. Many of those shipments are from storage tanks at ports, rather than freshly-pumped crude.",World Oil Online,energy,,[],"Libyan oil output reaches 500,000 barrels per day as industry restarts",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/10/16/libyan-oil-output-reaches-500-000-barrels-per-day-as-industry-restarts,None,
11402892,2020-10-12,"(Bloomberg) --Libya took a major step toward reviving its battered oil industry by reopening its biggest field, presenting a new headache for OPEC+ as the alliance of major producers tries to curb global supplies.

The National Oil Corp., Libya's state energy company, lifted force majeure on the western deposit of Sharara and instructed its operator to resume production, according to a statement on Sunday. The field will initially pump 40,000 barrels of crude a day, before reaching its capacity of almost 300,000 barrels next week, a person with knowledge of the situation said.

That would double overall output in Libya to around 600,000 barrels daily, said the person, who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to speak to media.

Crude from Sharara has begun reaching storage tanks at the port of Zawiya, another person said.

Sharara's reopening follows a truce in Libya's long-running civil war that's already led to many oil fields and ports in the east starting up after an almost total shutdown since January.

The NOC didn't mention the nearby deposit of El Feel, or Elephant in Arabic. The 70,000-barrel-a-day field normally follows Sharara's shutdowns and restarts because it relies on electricity from its bigger neighbor to operate.

Headwind for OPEC

Libya is an OPEC+ member and home to Africa's largest crude reserves. But it's exempt from the group's supply cuts, initiated in May as the coronavirus pandemic stifled economies and caused oil prices to tank. The alliance, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, planned to ease the curbs by 2 millions barrels a day from the start of 2021.

Yet with virus cases accelerating in many countries, the cartel faces a difficult decision at its next policy meeting on Nov. 30-Dec. 1: whether to stay the course or delay the increase in production. Benchmark Brent crude has more than doubled to around $42.25 a barrel since May, but it's still down 36% this year.

""The Libyan oil restart is gaining momentum faster than most people expected,"" said Bill Farren-Price, a director at energy analysis firm Enverus. The likelihood of more Libyan exports is ""an additional headwind for OPEC at a time when it is already grappling with softer than expected demand as the second wave of Covid-19 intensifies.""

JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecasts that production will rise to 1 million barrels daily by March.

Still, the North African nation's energy infrastructure is crumbling after almost 10 years of conflict and chaos following the ouster of former dictator Muammar Qaddafi in 2011. Frequent shutdowns and a lack of nuts-and-bolts servicing have left pipelines corroding and storage tanks collapsing. The NOC's chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, told Bloomberg in June it would cost more than $100 million to fix wellheads alone, limiting the nation's ability to ramp up production quickly.

Force majeure is a legal status protecting a party that can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control. Sharara is run as a joint venture between the NOC, France's Total SE, Spain's Repsol SA, Austria's OMV AG and Norway's Equinor ASA.

The NOC, based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, said it reached a ""gentlemen's agreement"" with militias known as the Petroleum Facilities Guard who were active near Sharara. The militias are obliged to ""end all obstacles"" hindering operations at the field, the NOC said. That came after United Nations-sponsored talks this month in Egypt, which were partly about restoring security at Libya's oil facilities.

Libya was producing 1.2 million barrels a day last year. Khalifa Haftar, a Russian-backed commander who controls much of the east, blockaded ports and fields in mid-January as he attempted to unseat the UN-supported government in Tripoli. That caused output to slump to less than 100,000 barrels a day, most of it from offshore fields.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Zawiya, Libya', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'South Africa', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'France', 'Spain', 'Austria', 'Tripoli', 'Egypt']","Libya's biggest oil field reopens, adding to OPEC's challenges",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/10/12/libya-s-biggest-oil-field-reopens-adding-to-opec-s-challenges,None,
11402893,2020-10-04,"(Bloomberg) --Libya's oil output has risen to 295,000 barrels following a truce in the OPEC nation's civil war and the lifting of a blockade on energy facilities.

Fields that feed the newly restarted eastern ports of Hariga, Brega and Zueitina are ramping up production, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Output was 250,000 barrels a day a week ago and will rise further as ships dock and load crude from storage tanks, allowing fields to pump more, the person said.

Libya's restart is weighing on oil prices just as traders become more bearish about the outlook for energy demand with many nations introducing stricter restrictions to curb the Coronavirus pandemic.

Brega is set to export 1.8 million barrels in October via three cargoes, according to a loading program. Zueitina is set to load five cargoes. Hariga has loaded two tankers of one million barrels each in the past two weeks.

The loading programs are preliminary and Libya may export more than the schedule suggests.

The country, home of Africa's largest oil reserves, pumped around 1.2 million barrels a day at the start of the year, before the blockade shut down most ports and fields.

11402894,2020-10-02,"(Bloomberg) --Oil extended losses on Friday as it got caught up in a broad downward move in financial markets after President Donald Trump said he had tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.

Futures in New York fell toward $37 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent dropped as much as 3.7%. The U.S. president announced that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19, shortly after one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, had fallen ill with the coronavirus. Asian stocks retreated, as did European and U.S. equity futures, while the dollar swung wildly.

Trump's positive result will likely sharpen already intense attention on his handling of the pandemic as he campaigns for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden, who leads in national polls. Oil was already lower before the news as the chance of any more U.S. fiscal stimulus before the November election appeared to be fading after talks yielded no immediate breakthrough.

""Trump and the coronavirus news, along with the setback to the talks on the U.S. stimulus package, are just triggers and they're serving as a reminder that the global economy is in trouble at least for the next six months,"" said Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore. ""What's coming on top of that is the realization that there's more supply coming into the market just as demand growth is weakening.""

The coronavirus is resurgent in Europe and hasn't been brought under control in big economies such as India, leading to a chorus of forecasters scaling back their estimates for when oil demand will get back to pre-virus levels. Still, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' crude production was almost unchanged last month from August, according to a Bloomberg survey.

Oil prices are heading for their fourth weekly loss in five amid signs demand has stabilized well below pre-virus levels as the pandemic proves stubbornly persistent. Chinese buying has flagged in recent months after a spree earlier in the year and there's still a big overhang of inventories worldwide, while refiners are struggling with growing gluts of diesel and jet fuel.

Prices:

The United Arab Emirates cut its oil output to the lowest in two years, offsetting increased Saudi Arabian exports as well as added output from Venezuela, Libya and Iran. Iraq also said it remains committed to the OPEC+ cuts, including extra curbs to compensate for previous overproduction.

OPEC production averaged 24.43 million barrels a day in September, according to the Bloomberg survey, compared with 24.39 million in August. Output was as high as 30.44 million in April as producers opened the taps amid the price war.

The prompt spreads for both WTI and Brent have fallen a bit further into contango --where near-dated prices are cheaper than later-dated ones -- this week, suggesting concern about over-supply is increasing slightly.

The Sarir field opened on Tuesday, according to its operator, Arabian Gulf Oil Co. Production is just 30,000 barrels a day for now. But with a capacity of about 200,000, it's the biggest deposit in the country to restart since an almost-total shutdown of Libyan energy facilities in January.

Much of the country's ""oil crescent"" -- a cluster of ports and fields in the east -- is back onstream, though not yet at full capacity. Libya's western fields, including Sharara, the biggest in the North African nation, are still closed. The state-run National Oil Corp. has said foreign mercenaries and other fighters must leave facilities before than can reopen.

Overall oil output has reached about 300,000 barrels a day, up from 80,000 at the start of the month.

Libya has seen false dawns before, and previous deals to stop the conflict have quickly collapsed. But if this one holds, JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecasts that production can hit 1 million barrels a day by March.

The potential for extra Libyan supplies is putting pressure on oil prices just as traders fret about the outlook for energy demand with the coronavirus pandemic still raging. Brent crude is down 3.6% this week to around $40.50 a barrel, increasing its loss this year to almost 40%.

Meanwhile, three of the world's biggest independent oil traders said consumption won't meaningfully recover for at least another 18 months and Total SE said demand growth will end around 2030.

""Sentiment is suffering from the uncertainties related to Covid-19,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA. ""The first is uncertainty around the implementation of new, or the continuation of existing, fiscal measures to support the economy. The second is related to the re-introduction of stricter guidance, notably in Europe, to stem the tide of a second wave of outbreaks.""

The market is contending with an increase in supply from OPEC+ members including Libya, as Russia likely exceeded its OPEC+ quota. U.S. inventory data Wednesday will give an updated outlook on consumption. Crude stockpiles are seen higher week-on-week and gasoline lower, a Bloomberg survey shows. Oil closed at the highest in more than a week on Monday.

""Despite yesterday's impressive rally in risk assets, investors will find it premature to become upbeat,"" said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga. Actual ""demand data will probably bear more relevance"" than the U.S. stockpile figures, he said.

11402897,2020-09-28,"(Bloomberg) --With weeks to go before Azerbaijan is due to start piping gas to the European Union, a decades-old conflict with its Eurasian neighbor Armenia is flaring up again.

So far, oil and gas markets have yet to be spooked by the conflict -- perhaps because global energy demand was drastically reduced by the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning producers the world over have spare capacity should the worst-case scenario arise -- the bombing of the pipeline and an ensuing environmental disaster. In normal times, a material disruption would likely boost energy prices.

The conflict centers on the Nagorno-Karabakh region claimed by both countries. In theory, it has the potential to disrupt oil and gas flows from Azerbaijan, since export pipelines from the Caspian Sea region's second-biggest crude producer run within just 10 miles of its border with Armenia.

Azerbaijan exports the vast majority of its crude oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline to an export terminal on Turkey's Mediterranean coast. Additional volumes are pumped to the Black Sea port of Supsa in Georgia. Natural gas exports flow through the South Caucasus pipeline to Georgia and Turkey, and are due to reach EU markets later this year. All three run in parallel through Azerbaijan.

Most of the oil and gas pumped through the lines is produced by two consortia led by BP Plc, which lift oil from the Azeri, Chirag and Gunashli fields and gas from the Shah Deniz deposit in the Caspian Sea. Small volumes of crude from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan on the eastern shore of the Caspian are also pumped through the BTC pipeline. It has a capacity of 1.2 million barrels a day, but carries less than half that in practice. Another 80,000 barrels a day flow to Supsa.

Azerbaijan also pumps gas through an export pipeline that runs alongside its oil conduits. In 2019, the country delivered 9.2 billion cubic meters (325 billion cubic feet) of gas to Turkey through the South Caucasus Pipeline. That line is part of the 4,000 km, U.S.-backed, Southern Gas Corridor, which cost BP and partners around $40 billion to build. Azerbaijan is due to begin gas deliveries to Italy and Greece through the line next month. Those flows could meet abut 3% of the EU's gas imports, although the bloc has ample sources of alternative supplies.

While the proximity of the pipelines to the border puts them at potential risk, Armenia has not attacked the lines during previous escalations in the conflict between the two countries, which has been simmering for almost 30 years.

Importantly, the coronavirus has led to a surplus of oil and gas production capacity worldwide. Oil demand will be 7.1% lower this quarter than it was a year earlier, according to the International Energy Agency. Nations including Saudi Arabia and Russia responded to that weakness by pumping less crude, but if called for, they could easily bring those barrels back onto the market.

Back in June, the IEA was predicting a 4% drop in gas consumption this year, twice the decline seen during the 2008-09 financial crisis. That only exacerbated a glut that already existed because of excess supply.

Hard to Hit

Buried up to two meters below the ground, the pipelines wouldn't make easy targets, and Armenia would certainly be blamed for any environmental damage resulting from a breach.

In 2008, Georgia's National Security Council claimed the BTC line was targeted by Russian missiles, an allegation Russia denied. An earlier attack on the line in Turkey, claimed by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, closed the line for several weeks in the same year.

Azerbaijan has few alternatives to ship its crude, and none for its gas. Some oil could be sent for export via a pipeline to Russia, but that would depend on being able to strike a deal with its northern neighbor, which has traditionally sided with Armenia in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Oil markets, though, don't seem particularly worried by any potential disruption to exports of Azeri crude, with Brent crude little changed on the day and volumes low. Natural gas futures are similarly becalmed.

Ample supplies in the Mediterranean of the type of light, sweet crude produced by Azerbaijan may be helping to mitigate oil-market concerns. Those supplies could rise further in the coming weeks if Libya succeeds in boosting flows as a result of a political truce in its civil wa",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Turkey', 'Azerbaijan', 'Armenia', 'Supsa', 'Georgia (country)', 'Turkmenistan', 'Russia', 'Kazakhstan', 'United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Italy', 'Greece', 'Libya']","Energy markets shrug off Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict, for now",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/9/28/energy-markets-shrug-off-azerbaijan-armenia-conflict-for-now,None,
11402898,2020-09-28,"DUBAI (Bloomberg) --Libya's oil industry, all but shut down since January because of civil war, is reopening -- in parts.

Oil output has almost tripled to 250,000 barrels a day since the partial lifting last week of a blockade on the OPEC member's energy facilities.

The state National Oil Corp. allowed exports to resume at the ports of Hariga, Brega and Zueitina. Four other oil ports are still closed, including Es Sider and Ras Lanuf -- the country's largest and third-largest -- and Zawiya, which ships crude from Libya's biggest field, Sharara. The NOC said it's evaluating security at export terminals that are still shut.

Production in Libya, home to Africa's largest crude reserves, plummeted to less than 100,000 barrels a day in January from 1.2 million after Khalifa Haftar, a Russian-backed commander who controls the nation's eastern region, blockaded energy infrastructure.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts that output will rebound to 550,000 barrels a day by the end of the year. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence see production hitting 1 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter -- putting more pressure on oil prices already hammered by the coronavirus pandemic -- if a truce holds between Haftar and the United Nations-recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

Libya has a way of confounding optimists, and previous agreements to reopen its oil industry have failed. That said, any additional supplies would enter the crude market at an awkward time: A recovery from the historic slump triggered by the virus pandemic is faltering, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia are easing their self-imposed limits on output.

Libya is exempt from these OPEC+ limits, due to its strife. However, the amount of any extra oil the country can export will depend on how quickly it can fix wellheads, pipelines and storage tanks that have been neglected or damaged during the conflict.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Dubai', 'Zawiya, Libya', 'Brega', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Russia']","Libyan oil output triples after blockade deal, with more growth to come",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/9/28/libyan-oil-output-triples-after-blockade-deal-with-more-growth-to-come,None,
11402899,2020-09-26,"(Bloomberg) --Oil fell this week amid growing concerns that another wave of the coronavirus pandemic will spark tighter lockdown measures and further stifle crude demand.

New York futures edged lower Friday and fell 2.1% on the week. The number of U.S. coronavirus cases rose above 7 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, a second governor tested positive for Covid-19 as cases surge around the country.

At the same time, the market is contending with returning supply. Oil traders have reported a sharp increase in Iraqi exports for next month, while output from Libya has shown signs of rising this week.

""There are concerns about the stalling economic recovery,"" said Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures LLC in Chicago. When the world gets a vaccine, widespread reopenings and a meaningful increase in travel, ""that's when you're going to start to see demand pick up"" and prices rally.

U.S. crude's gradual climb since May has come to a halt in September, with futures on track to drop about 5.5% this month. Still, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said oil consumption is currently just above 93 million barrels a day and may rise 1.8 million a day to the end of the year. Yet, any meaningful recovery in consumption has so far been held back by the lingering pandemic.

""We're going to be range-bound for a while until there's the perception that the bulk of the Covid impact on demand is behind us,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research. Additionally ""if the OPEC+ deal starts to fall apart and we get a lot more crude, that would send prices down.""

Prices:

In a sign of just how damaging the virus has been to oil demand, the industry's largest tankers next year will earn 8% less than they were anticipating back in May, according to a survey of shipping analysts by Bloomberg. That comes as nations including Saudi Arabia and Russia have drastically scaled back output, draining the hoard at sea and diminishing the flow of cargoes.

The spread between Nymex gasoline futures and WTI rallied over 9% on Friday toward $10 a barrel. Still, the so-called crack remains at its lowest seasonally since 2013. At the same time, Gulf Coast gasoline climbed to a one-month high as refiners snapped up winter-grade fuel and on dwindling fall stockpiles.

""The gasoline crack spread strength is notable today, but it is hard to get too excited given the seasonal weakness that lies ahead for RBOB,"" said Ryan Fitzmaurice, commodities strategist at Rabobank.

11402900,2020-09-23,"(Bloomberg) --Libya's state oil company reopened another port, the third to resume operation in less than a week, as a political truce takes hold in the OPEC member's devastating civil war.

The National Oil Corp. is ending force majeure -- a legal status protecting a party that can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control -- at Zueitina in eastern Libya after a ""significant improvement"" in security there, it said Tuesday. The NOC allowed exports to resume days earlier from the Hariga and Brega terminals. The three ports had been shut down since January as part of a wider blockade.

The NOC said it's evaluating security at Libya's other export terminals as the country with Africa's largest crude reserves edges closer to reviving its battered oil industry. Production nationwide will more than double by next week to 260,000 barrels a day, the company said late Monday.

The three eastern ports were closed eight months ago after Khalifa Haftar, a Russian-backed commander who controls eastern Libya, blockaded energy facilities in his struggle to unseat the United Nations-supported government in the western capital, Tripoli. Libya's daily crude output slumped as a result to less than 100,000 barrels from 1.2 million last year. The NOC said Wednesday that it shipped $38.2 million of oil, natural gas and condensate in July, the lowest monthly figure this year.

Hariga, Brega, and Zueitina are now classified as ""safe ports,"" the NOC said in a statement. ""The remaining oil fields and ports are being evaluated according to the safety and security standards in force in the national oil sector.""

Oil facilities have been the main prize of a civil war now almost a decade old, with different groups closing or sabotaging them to press political and economic demands. The industry's gradual reopening began after Haftar said on Sept. 18 that he would lift his blockade. The NOC has cited the dangers of resuming oil production where armed forces are close by.

Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, the country's largest and third-largest oil ports, remain closed, as does the Zawiya terminal, which ordinarily exports crude from the country's biggest field, Sharara.

The amount of extra oil Libya can export will also depend on how quickly it can fix wellheads, pipelines and storage tanks that have been neglected or damaged during the conflict. Production will increase as workers return to fields that feed Brega and Hariga, and oil tankers will start arriving at both ports to load crude, the NOC said.

The Suezmax tanker Delta Hellas will reach Hariga on Wednesday to load 1 million barrels of crude from storage, thereby enabling production at the Sarir and Messla oil fields to resume immediately, Arabian Gulf Oil Co., which operates both deposits, said on its Facebook page.

Crude storage tanks at Libyan export terminals can hold 24.4 million barrels, but only Hariga and Zueitina are much more than 50% full and able to ""sustain an immediate increase in exports"" before output resumes at oil fields, OilX analysts including Juan Carlos Rodriguez and Florian Thaler wrote in a report.

Although previous agreements to reopen Libya's oil industry have failed, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reckons exports could reach 550,000 barrels a day by year-end. Bloomberg Intelligence thinks a figure of close to 1 million is possible.

""Should the implementation of the agreement prove successful, a big if, production could climb to 500,000 barrels a day within a month,"" Mohammad Darwazah, an analyst at consultant Medley Global Advisors, said in a note. ""Any further incremental additions will hinge on how quickly Sharara can restart and ramp up, and whether the NOC agrees to reopen Es Sider and Ras Lanuf.""

11402901,2020-09-21,"(Bloomberg) --Oil declined as Libya signaled the resumption of some crude exports, while surging coronavirus cases clouded the outlook for demand and weighed on risky assets.

Futures in New York fell 2.1% toward $40 a barrel. Libya is moving closer to reopening its battered oil industry after it told companies to resume production at some fields that are free of foreign mercenaries and fighters. This will add to already rising supply from OPEC+ nations, and comes as virus infections are starting to increase again in many places around the world.

The UK said it's close to a ""tipping point"" with the public health crisis, while there were predictions of at least one more virus cycle in America. That helped drive down European equities by the most since July, while U.S. stock futures also dropped.

U.S. benchmark crude prices jumped 10% last week after a show of determination by Saudi Arabia, the most influential Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries member, to defend the market. The Saudis hinted they're prepared for new output cuts, and lambasted OPEC+ nations that have cheated on quotas. But demand and supply worries have returned for investors at the start of this week.

""Between tough talk from Saudi Arabia and the possible resumption of Libyan oil production, the oil market is facing a fork in the road this week,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, oil strategist at BNP Paribas SA. ""Which option it chooses to travel will largely depend on how much real progress will come about in Libya.""

Libya's National Oil Corp. is ending force majeure -- a legal status protecting a party that can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control -- at ""secure"" facilities in the conflict-ridden nation and has told companies to resume production. The country's overall oil production is set to reach 310,000 barrels a day in a few days from the current 90,000 a day, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.

Output will probably increase to 550,000 barrels a day by the end of 2020 and to almost 1 million by the middle of next year, according to forecasts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

11402903,2020-09-13,"(Bloomberg) --It was meant to be the week when OPEC nations gathered in Baghdad to celebrate the cartel's six decades as a dominant force in global oil markets.

Instead, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will convene online, and reflect on whether the coronavirus has thwarted their best efforts to keep the market afloat.

After reviving crude prices from an unprecedented collapse over the spring, OPEC+ is seeing the recovery stall and fuel demand falter as the deadly pandemic surges once again. Prices slipped below $40 a barrel last week for the first time since June.

On September 17th, Saudi Arabia and Russia will chair a monitoring meeting to assess whether the vast production cuts, which they started easing in August, are still staving off an oil glut. New signs of exporters reneging on the deal aren't helping.

""There were some major assumptions built in on where demand and the recovery would be now, and it just hasn't happened,"" said Mohammad Darwazah, an analyst at research firm Medley Global Advisors LLC. ""If I'm OPEC and if I'm Saudi Arabia, I would be concerned.""

The relapse is a source of acute financial distress for OPEC nations, from poorer members like Nigeria and Venezuela -- who need crude prices far above current levels to cover government spending -- all the way up to wealthy Gulf monarchies like Kuwait.

Riyadh and Moscow had anticipated that a resumption in global economic activity, combined with the supply curbs, would sharply deplete the hoard of surplus oil inventory accumulated during lockdowns. But there are growing signs the market isn't tightening so fast.

The peak holiday driving season has passed in the U.S., yet rush-hour traffic is still sparse and crude inventories stubbornly high. In India, the third-biggest consumer, transport-fuel sales remained 20% below year-ago levels last month. Even in China, where refiners binged on crude at the height of the crisis, buying has slowed.

Trading houses are hiring oil tankers on long-term contracts once again to store surplus barrels.

And Libya, which is exempt from the output cuts because of a civil war that's all but shut down its oil industry, may resume exports soon, according to U.S. officials. The North African country's production has slumped to less than 100,000 barrels a day from 1.1 million at the end of last year.

The downturn isn't yet severe enough for OPEC+ to reimpose the full output cutbacks made in the second quarter, according to Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC. After tapering the cuts last month from 9.7 million barrels a day to 7.7 million, a sense of inertia means there will be a ""high bar"" for any new action, she said.

""For the men who reside in the palaces and the presidential halls, there is a price at which they make a panicked phone call,"" said Croft. ""The question is, what is the price?""

In theory, OPEC's task should get easier next quarter as demand for winter fuels kicks in and a gradually mending global economy rekindles the need for road and aviation fuels, data from the International Energy Agency in Paris shows.

Strong Statement

But as the outlook continues to darken, the Saudis may choose to underscore their readiness to act.

""We expect a strong statement that if markets continue to weaken, the producer group will be prepared to trim output further,"" said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc.

In the meantime, the kingdom will press on with its mission to enforce rigorous implementation of the curbs.

Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has achieved an unusual degree of success in this area, bringing habitual quota-violators like Iraq and Nigeria to heel by assigning them ""compensation cuts"" to make up for earlier cheating.

The two countries have so far implemented only a fraction of those extra curbs, and Baghdad is expected to seek more time to deliver the rest. Nonetheless, the punishment itself has apparently spurred them to previously unseen levels of compliance with the original quotas.

Just as they toe the line, Riyadh is encountering a new challenge from an unexpected quarter. The United Arab Emirates, traditionally a staunch ally, has admitted to flouting its limits by roughly 20%, while promising to correct the error. Export data from consultants like Petro-Logistics SA and Kpler SAS indicate the UAE's transgression could be many times bigger.

The Saudis will likely to try discreetly address the misbehavior of their Gulf partner, which for now appears a minor blemish in an otherwise well-executed strategy, said RBC's Croft. The bigger issue is whether OPEC+ responds promptly enough if the deterioration in oil demand continues.

""Judged on compliance, I think they could take a victory lap,"" she said. ""The real challenge is -- is the organization nimble enough? If this really does stall out, how fast can they react?""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Moscow', 'Riyadh', 'Baghdad', 'Venezuela', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Nigeria', 'Libya', 'Kuwait', 'India', 'China', 'Paris', 'Iraq', 'United Arab Emirates', 'South Africa']",Faltering oil demand puts new pressure on OPEC+ production agreements,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/9/11/faltering-oil-demand-puts-new-pressure-on-opecplus-production-agreements,None,
11402904,2020-09-10,"(Bloomberg) - Turkey is in talks over oil and gas exploration in Libya, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's administration seeks business opportunities in the conflict-ridden North African country.

Turkey and Libya's United Nations-recognized government, which controls the capital Tripoli and other parts of the west, are discussing onshore and offshore energy blocks, according to a Turkish energy official, who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public.

Turkish officials also held talks with Libya's National Oil Corp. about power generation and pipeline operations, the person said. The official did not specify whether the NOC was included in negotiations about energy exploration.

The NOC, also based in Tripoli, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

An energy deal would strengthen Turkey's ties with the Government of National Accord, which fended off a campaign by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar to capture Tripoli and wrest full control of the OPEC member earlier this year. Ankara sent troops and military advisers to Libya in January, which proved crucial in turning the tide against Haftar.

Libya, home to Africa's largest crude oil reserves, has been wracked by war and lawlessness since a 2011 revolt that toppled former dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi. The country is divided between the GNA and Haftar's Libyan National Army, which is backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

The war has devastated Libya's oil industry. It pumped just 100,000 barrels of crude a day in July, a fraction of the 1.6 million barrels of daily output a decade ago.

Western Libya is home to the country's biggest oil field, Sharara.

Turkey has deep historical ties to Libya, which the Turks ruled as part of the former Ottoman Empire until 1912.

The GNA said its prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, visited Turkey earlier this month to discuss economic and security cooperation with Erdogan.

The two sides discussed ""the return of Turkish companies to complete halted infrastructure projects in Libya and contributing to new projects,"" according to a GNA statement on Sept. 6.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Libya', 'Ankara', 'Russia', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates']",Turkey in talks to secure Libyan oil and gas exploration rights,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/9/10/turkey-in-talks-to-secure-libyan-oil-and-gas-exploration-rights,None,
11402905,2020-08-25,"ANKARA (Bloomberg) --German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urged Greece and Turkey to restart talks over their competing claims to economic sovereignty in contested waters of the eastern Mediterranean as he visits the NATO allies on Tuesday.

""The current situation in the eastern Mediterranean is playing with fire, with any small spark potentially leading to catastrophe,"" Maas said in Athens alongside his Greek counterpart Nikolaos Dendias. ""What we need immediately are signals of de-escalation and a readiness for dialog.""

The disputed region has become an energy hot spot with big natural gas finds for European Union member Cyprus, Israel and Egypt in recent years, and Turkey's push to secure a share of the resources has exacerbated strains between historic rivals. The offshore gas reserves have attracted companies from around the world, including ExxonMobil Corp.

German-mediated negotiations collapsed earlier this month after the Athens government announced a maritime delimitation agreement with Egypt on Aug. 6, similar to a Turkey-Libya deal in December.

Disputed Waters

""Greece has shown that it's ready for dialog, but not amid challenges and as its sovereign rights are being violated,"" Dendias said, adding that he expects a possible list of sanctions against Turkey to be presented at an EU meeting later this week.

Greece on Monday began joint military exercises with the U.S. in an area that partially overlapped with the expected location of a Turkish survey ship, which Ankara had announced would explore that area until Aug. 27, three days longer than had been originally planned.

Maas faces an uphill struggle. Late on Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan again cast Greece as the villain. ""From now on, Greece will be the cause of every negativity in the region, and Greece will suffer the biggest harm,"" he said. ""Turkey will not take a step back.""

Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas said Athens would respond ""calmly and readily on both the diplomatic and business levels. And with national confidence, it does whatever it takes to defend its sovereign rights.""

Maas, who is scheduled to travel to Ankara later Tuesday and meet Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, said tensions in the Mediterranean not only threaten the relationship between the EU and Turkey but the entire region.

EU foreign ministers will meet in Berlin this week to discuss ""our relationship with Turkey, and Greece's voice will have special weight,"" Maas said.

Greece says that islands must be taken into account in delineating a country's continental shelf, in line with the United Nations Law of the Sea, which Turkey has not signed. Ankara argues it should be measured from the mainland, and that the area south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo -- just a few kilometers off Turkey's southern coast -- therefore falls within its exclusive zone.

Turkey is also at loggerheads with Cyprus over offshore gas reserves around the island, where the Republic of Cyprus is an EU member state and officially has sovereignty over the entire island.

But the island has been effectively divided into two since Turkey's military captured the northern third in 1974, following a coup attempt in which a military junta in Athens sought to unite Cyprus with Greece. The Turkish minority's self-proclaimed state in the north, recognized only by Ankara, also claims rights to any energy resources discovered off its coast.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Athens', 'Turkey', 'Greece', 'Ankara', 'Egypt', 'United States', 'Israel', 'Cyprus', 'Berlin', 'Kastellorizo']",Germany pushes for talks to de-escalate Greece and Turkey's energy battle,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/8/25/germany-pushes-for-talks-to-de-escalate-greece-and-turkey-s-energy-battle,None,
11402906,2020-08-23,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) - Libya's Turkish-backed government announced a cease-fire, months after inflicting a heavy defeat on Russian-supported military commander Khalifa Haftar, raising hopes for an end to a spiraling proxy war.

The announcement on Friday and a reciprocal call for a truce from the head of the eastern-based legislature Aguileh Saleh come on the heels of United Nations-mediated talks in Geneva this week, and a phone call between the Russian and Turkish foreign ministers. Their countries have emerged as key power brokers in the North African nation that has the continent's biggest oil reserves.

Haftar, aided by Russian mercenaries, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, had led a failed offensive to capture the capital, Tripoli, from the internationally recognized government. A Turkish military intervention helped rout his self-styled Libyan National Army earlier this year, and Haftar's forces fell back to Sirte, the gateway to key oil assets.

The truce announcement may bolster efforts to restart oil fields and terminals that have been closed under orders from Haftar since January, costing the country almost $8 billion in lost revenues. The National Oil Corp. welcomed calls from both sides to resume crude output, but said in a statement armed groups needed to leave oil installations before it could lift force majeure.

'Serious' Dialogue

The powerful interior minister in the Tripoli-based government, Fathi Bashagha, said in an interview that the cease-fire wouldn't have happened without support from the U.S., Turkey, Egypt and Qatar.

""It must be followed by a serious political dialogue that leads to a settlement,"" he said. ""Those steps must be taken quickly.""

In some of the first international reaction, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi welcomed the announcement as did the U.S. German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said that from first reports it ""could be an important step."" The UN, which also helped mediate the cease-fire, acclaimed the move.

In his statement, Saleh, who has an uneasy alliance with Haftar, backed a proposal to resume oil production and freeze revenues in a foreign account held by the central bank while an arrangement is made to fairly distribute the money.

But only Haftar can make that decision and he's yet to comment on Friday's developments. Earlier this week, a Haftar-aligned force said it would permit the export of stored fuel to make space for badly needed gas amid power shortages.

Libya has been fractured and often convulsed by conflict since the 2011 NATO-backed ouster and killing of Moammar Qaddafi. That's left the nation that sits atop Africa's largest crude reserves in economic shambles.

Haftar's offer of an Egyptian-sponsored truce in June was spurned by the Tripoli government, which insisted it would take Sirte before halting its offensive. A subsequent military build both in Sirte and near the Juffra airbase also controlled by Haftar, compelled both sides to informally stop fighting although the public threats continued, officials linked to the rival sides told Bloomberg.

Egypt, which neighbors Libya, had threatened to intervene militarily if government forces attacked Sirte, sparking fears of a military confrontation between Turkey on the one hand, and Egypt, Russia and the UAE on the other.

Russian Mercenaries

Western and Arab diplomats say Haftar's forces are backed by hundreds of Russian mercenaries and an S-300 air-defense system, and supported by a fleet of advanced Russian-supplied jet fighters.

In its cease-fire announcement, the Tripoli-based government signaled the difficulties ahead. Sirte, it said, should be turned into a demilitarized zone, something Haftar has rejected. His ally Saleh, however, said the city should be secured by a joint police force from across the country.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Cairo', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Egypt', 'Geneva', 'Sirte', 'Tripoli', 'United States', 'Qatar', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Germany']",Libya calls for cease-fire following a failed rebel assault on Tripoli,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/8/21/libya-calls-for-cease-fire-following-a-failed-rebel-assault-on-tripoli,None,
11402907,2020-08-18,"ANKARA (Bloomberg) - Turkey dispatched a drilling ship to an area off the southwestern coast of Cyprus on Tuesday, in a move that could fuel territorial disputes with EU member states in the eastern Mediterranean.

Ankara resumed its search of the contested waters last week after German-mediated negotiations with Greece collapsed when Athens announced a maritime delimitation agreement with Egypt on Aug. 6 in retaliation to a similar deal between Turkey and Libya.

The eastern Mediterranean has become an energy hot spot with big finds for EU member Cyprus, as well as Israel and Egypt in recent years. Turkey is now pushing to secure a share of the resources, defying warnings from the bloc that its unilateral actions could further strain ties.

France has temporarily beefed up its military presence in the region to ward against Turkey's steps. Turkey on Monday accused France, Armenia and the United Arab Emirates of forming an alliance against Turkey. The UAE and Egypt are allies, while Armenia is a landlocked country and a historical rival of Turkey.

This ""unravels the dimensions of an insidious alliance that is being attempted to be forged against Turkey,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""No matter what, Turkey will resolutely continue to protect both her and Turkish Cypriots' rights in the Eastern Mediterranean stemming from international law. No alliance of malice will manage to prevent this.""

After dispatching the Oruc Reis survey ship to the south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo last week, Turkey added the 230-meter (755-foot) long Yavuz drilling vessel on Tuesday. It's accompanied by three offshore supply ships under the protection of the Turkish navy. ""All vessels are strongly advised not to enter this area,"" a Turkish navy website said Saturday as it designated exploration areas off-limits through Sept. 15.

Turkey -- which sent troops and captured the northern third of Cyprus in the wake of a 1974 coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece -- doesn't recognize Cyprus as a sovereign country and opposes Cypriot drilling without an agreement on sharing any proceeds with the Turkish Cypriots.

The internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus has licensed several offshore exploration blocks, some of them located in disputed waters. Cyprus has an agreement with Exxon Mobil, Total SA and Eni SpA for oil and natural gas exploration rights near an area where Turkey wants to drill.

Ankara also doesn't recognize Greece's claim that its territorial waters start immediately south of the island of Kastellorizo, the most distant Greek outpost in the contested area. It argues that a country's continental shelf should be measured from its mainland. Greece says that islands must also be taken into account in delineating a country's continental shelf, in line with the UN Law of the Sea.

""The escalation of the Turkish provocation is directed against Europe and the response must be escalated accordingly,"" Greek Foreign Minister Nikolaos Dendias said after meeting with his Cypriot counterpart Nicos Christodoulides in Nicosia.

11402908,2020-08-12,"LONDON (Bloomberg) --From Baghdad and Algiers to Caracas, many of the world's oil capitals are experiencing a summer of discontent. It could be a glimpse of their future.

Iraq has seen fatal protests as its electricity grid buckles amid searing heat, while Venezuela's oil production has sunk to a 75-year low. In Algeria's capital, tension is simmering as the hardship of virus lockdowns brings the risk of renewed demonstrations and riots.

OPEC has revived oil from its historic drop but prices near $40 are still far too low for most members as they grapple with weak economies, unstable governments, restless young populations, and the ravages of climate change. As the legacy of the pandemic and the switch to cleaner energy threatens to keep crude prices lower for longer, there are profound consequences for the way oil-rich countries are run.

""The shaky six of OPEC -- Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela -- are facing a very precarious political and economic outlook,"" said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC.

OPEC's revenue is down about 50% from a year ago, and members' long-running financial ailments are coming to the fore.

Oil-dependent Angola is seeking to increase a $3.7 billion International Monetary Fund loan by $800 million. The country and Nigeria have devalued their currencies as a shortage of foreign exchange hammers local businesses. Iran -- battered by the twin shocks of U.S. sanctions and the virus -- and neighboring Iraq have also reached out to the IMF.

Even Saudi Arabia isn't immune, rolling out a slew of austerity measures last quarter while contending with the tripling of its budget deficit to 109.2 billion riyals ($29 billion).

The strain has been showing for a while now. Last year, popular revolts forced the resignation of Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, and ended the 20-year rule of Algeria's Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

The prospects for petrostates have dramatically shifted from just a decade ago. Oil prices were near $100 a barrel then and consumers were worried about supplies running out. Now, OPEC is increasingly having to reckon with the prospect of peak demand, when consumption starts to decline as wind and solar power become more popular.

The International Energy Agency expects this turning point in the history of the industry could be just about a decade away. Covid-19 could make it even sooner.

Oil Demand Plateau

In May, BP Plc boss Bernard Looney said that remote working could erode the need for transport fuels and speed up the shift from hydrocarbons. Having consumed about 100 million barrels of oil each day last year, the world's thirst for petroleum may never be as intense again.

""The pandemic will accelerate many of the technologies and behaviors that were going to come anyway,"" said Amy Myers Jaffe, managing director of the climate policy lab at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. For governments reliant on oil sales, the implications could be grave.

""The idea that we're going to have some up-cycle that lasts for a decade, and produces oil prices between $80 and $100, and all these countries can collect up the rent again -- that seems less likely,"" she said.

Peak Demand

Still, oil is likely to remain a major energy source for years to come. The timing of peak demand is widely contested, with some forecasting it's unlikely for the next couple of decades at least. For oil to be displaced, billions of dollars of spending are needed for vehicle electrification and renewable energy.

Some exporters are using the downturn to diversify their economies. Saudi Arabia is pursuing reform, with its ""Vision 2030"" program seeking to develop other sectors such as tourism and technology.

But the plan is being thwarted by spending cuts and a struggle to attract foreign investment. And for countries such as Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela, which lack the kingdom's deep pockets, the challenge of reform may prove insuperable.

The Saudis may be content to see oil prices remain subdued a little longer, being keenly aware that another rally would only revitalize rivals like the U.S. shale industry, which has squeezed the kingdom hard over the past decade with a flood of crude, and could do so again.

Hitting the competition could buy OPEC some breathing space. American drillers have been laid low by the latest crisis, and other major companies including Exxon Mobil Corp., are scaling back investments, threatening to create in a supply gap in a few years that OPEC would need to fill.

But a slowdown in shale may only offer the cartel's members a short-lived respite, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc.

""That reprieve provides for some of them an opportunity to right the balance in their economies,"" Morse said. ""But for a number of them, it's sort of hopeless to think about righting the balance. It's a reprieve, but with the high probability of petro-state failure.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Venezuela', 'Iraq', 'Algeria', 'Caracas', 'London', 'Algiers', 'Baghdad', 'Nigeria', 'Iran', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Libya', 'Angola', 'United States']",A tough summer for oil-dependent nations may foretell their new normal,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/8/12/a-tough-summer-for-oil-dependent-nations-may-foretell-their-new-normal,None,

The petroleum industry is undergoing an unprecedented demand disruption and requires accurate forecasting and real-world economic models to maximize profitability. To accomplish the objective, an analysis was prepared, using a proprietary global petroleum model that combines geopolitical and macro-economic scenarios to generate quantitative outcomes for:

The model is underpinned by proprietary global databases of oil and gas fields, global potential of exploration, light tight shale oil (LTO) and shale gas basins.

Two representative scenarios from a set are presented below. These focus on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The scenario models generate crude oil, NGL and natural gas supply, demand and price outcomes for:

The common scenario elements are given in the Appendix at the end of the article.

The Covid-19 pandemic started in China toward the end of 2019 and, by April 2020, had spread aggressively to the rest of the Far East, Europe and North America. Between January and April 2020, the impact of travel restrictions and national lockdowns rapidly cut oil demand by 25-30 MMbpd. However, OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, did not respond to this major drop in demand until May. In fact, Saudi Arabia's crude oil production reached a peak of 11.9 MMbpd in April, an increase of 3 MMbpd since January 2020 in the midst of the pandemic.

Supply reduction. Non-OPEC producers, including the U.S., started to reduce production in March as spare storage capacity dwindled. This was particularly in Canada and the U.S. By the end of April, U.S. crude oil production had fallen by 1.8 MMbpd, mostly by shutting in production wells in the LTO basins. Belatedly, in April, OPEC convened a meeting to curtail production, and by June 2020, OPEC output had fallen by 6 MMbopd from January 2020. Unsurprisingly, OECD industry oil stocks rose by 300 MMbbl between January and April 2020. The consequences of OPEC/Saudi Arabia's misjudgment will weigh on oil prices until excess stocks are eliminated.

Most of Europe and the Far East seem to have drastically reduced the scale of the pandemic and may be well-placed to manage a second wave in the autumn-winter of 2020-2021, without excessive economic damage. However, the same cannot be said for the U.S., Central and South America, Africa, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. It seems likely in these areas that a second wave will emerge, while the first wave is still not under control. In this case, the economic damage is likely to be deeper and more far-reaching.

The oil market remains oversupplied, as it has since 2014, and this is most likely to continue into the second half of this decade. In this situation, the oil price is highly sensitive to OPEC policy and the effectiveness of its implementation. Managing the demand recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will be especially challenging for OPEC.

Demand. The historical and forecast pathways of global oil demand and economic growth for the two scenarios are depicted in Fig. 1. In the single-wave scenario, there is a rapid ""V""- shaped economic recovery into the first half of 2021, but oil demand does not return fully to the pre-pandemic trend. In the more pessimistic scenario, oil demand does not reach 2019 levels until 2022-2023 and remains well below the pre-pandemic trend. The current pandemic development suggests that an outcome close to this pessimistic scenario is more likely.

In the short term, the excess oil stocks will weigh on the oil price. Strict OPEC discipline in the face of a slow demand recovery will be required to clear these stocks over the next few years. These two scenarios model gasoline and diesel demand, assuming zero-emissions vehicles make up 60% of new vehicle sales by 2040. Therefore, they both forecast slowing oil demand toward a peak in the mid-2030s at some 105-108 MMbopd.

Supply. OPEC and Saudi Arabia face daunting tasks ahead that will challenge the unity of the group. The quality of analysis, policy and decision-making has to be greatly improved, if OPEC is to successfully navigate this decade. In the short term, matching supply to the likely faltering recovery demand will be difficult in the face of recovery of production from non-OPEC. Given the >300 MMbbl of excess stocks, it would be prudent for OPEC to err on the conservative side in restoring production.

In the medium term, the group also will have to manage the probable return of some of the 5.7 MMbopd of shut-in production in OPEC countries (Venezuela, Iran and Libya) and non-OPEC countries (Syria and Yemen) due to wars, sanctions and civil strife. Libyan production is expected to begin returning to the market in 2020, but there remains a high likelihood of further internal strife. The return of Venezuela and Iran is likely to be a slower process, with the slow decline of the Venezuelan state still underway and U.S. sanctions still applied to Iran.

Nevertheless, it seems likely that both Iran and Venezuela are likely to return to higher levels of production before the middle of this decade. Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC will have to accommodate this return, should it take place by cutting production. This will put considerable strain on OPEC countries that have been stretched financially by rash market share policy decisions since 2014 and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.

OPEC also will have to manage the recovery of U.S. LTO production, as demand and oil price rise. Figure 2 shows the forecast call on OPEC crude oil for the two scenarios. In the pessimistic scenario, the call on OPEC crude oil rises to 32 MMbpd in 2024, before falling to 31 MMbpd in the mid-to-late 2020s. Thereafter, the demand for OPEC oil rises into the 2030s, as several major non-OPEC producers commence secular declines, notably Russia.

In the U.S., LTO production has risen from zero in 2002 to nearly 7 MMbpd in 2019. It has met most of the growth in demand since 2011. U.S. LTO is essentially a price taker and not a swing producer, like OPEC. The price sensitivity of U.S. LTO varies from basin to basin, with the Permian being the most robust to declining oil price. Basin-by-basin modeling, using a proprietary drill-out model and historical rig count data, indicates that U.S. LTO production takes some six months to start to respond to a price signal, and up to 12 months to fully respond, as rig counts and the number of new producing wells fall. This is due to the time lags in unwinding operations, hedging horizons and costs of supply, as well as the need to maintain drilling to maintain production, due to the rapid decline rate of U.S. LTO wells.

Exceptionally, in the spring of 2020, U.S. LTO production fell sharply by more than 1 MMbpd, due to existing producing wells being shut-in, in the face of vanishing storage capacity and demand. The historical and forecast U.S. LTO production and rig counts from the main basins for the two Covid-19 scenario models are shown in Fig. 3. This highlights the delays in response to both falling and rising oil price.

And, U.S. LTO production is forecast to fall by 1.5-2.0 MMbpd and not recover until after 2022 (one wave of Covid-19 and rapid economic recovery) or after 2024 (two waves of Covid-19 and slow economic recovery), Fig. 3. Financially exposed operators, even in the lowest-cost Permian basin, are unlikely to survive without considerable external assistance and debt ""management."" Thereafter, oil price recovery supports increasing U.S. LTO production toward a plateau of 8-9 MMbpd in the early 2030s.

Figure 4 shows the widening gap between forecast oil demand and supply in the U.S., after the Covid-19 pandemic, until the mid-2020s. This is mainly because of the reduction in U.S. LTO production between 2020 and 2024. Net oil imports are forecast to be 3-4 MMbpd in this early-2020s period.

Price. The oil price trajectory has three phases in the period to 2030, Fig. 5:

The impact of coronavirus on the global economy and, hence, demand for oil is profound, particularly in the most likely case of a deep and lengthy recession associated with a prolonged pandemic. Without aggressive OPEC intervention, the average crude oil price could remain below $50/bbl until after mid-2022.

Until the late 2020s, the oil market is oversupplied, and OPEC policy is a crucial factor in this ""wobbly plateau"" phase. The price forecasts for the two scenarios in Fig. 5. are conditional on OPEC managing its production effectively, to only just meet the required call on OPEC crude oil.

The marked drop in the forecast price pathways, between 2024 and 2027, results from the rising U.S. LTO production, as the oil price rises above the $50-60/bbl range, Fig. 3.

OPEC has three policy response options:

If OPEC pursues a price target, the oil price can be held at, or close to, a desired level by further production restraint. If OPEC pursues market share, the oil price will sink to the cost of the marginal new barrel, around $40-45/bbl (rising demand), or the marginal cost of production at some $30/bbl (flat or falling demand). As we have seen in 2014, 2015-2016 and 2020, the market share policy does not work, because U.S. LTO is resilient to oil prices as low as $45-50/bbl. The only sure outcomes are to further and severely damage OPEC countries' finances, to constrain their ability to raise debt on the international markets, and to deplete foreign reserves.

In the second half of this decade, supply and demand are forecast to move closely into a tightening balance, as non-OPEC production, notably from Russia, commences declining, and U.S. LTO reaches a plateau. The oil price is expected to rise toward $80-90/bbl (one-wave pandemic scenario) or $70-80/bbl (two-wave pandemic scenario), even without OPEC intervention, Fig. 5.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Venezuela', 'Iran', 'Indian subcontinent', 'Libya', 'China', 'Canada', 'Yemen', 'Syria', 'Russia']","Impact of Covid-19 on oil supply, demand and price to 2030",https://www.worldoil.com/magazine/2020/august-2020/features/impact-of-covid-19-on-oil-supply-demand-and-price-to-2030,None,
11402910,2020-07-13,"DUBAI (Bloomberg) -- Libya's National Oil Corp. declared force majeure on exports again, accusing the United Arab Emirates of being behind a blockade as chaos continued to engulf the country's oil industry.

The NOC said Sunday that the UAE had instructed eastern forces in Libya to shut down oil production. The North African country had resumed exports just two days earlier, before eastern commander Khalifa Haftar ordered a halt Saturday night. The swift reversal reflects the persistent turmoil roiling the OPEC nation.

The UAE, along with Russia and Egypt, backs Haftar's army, which has insisted the blockade continue and said a tanker given permission to load oil at Es Sider port was just an exception. The Emirates' instruction is ""gravely disappointing, especially following repeated statements by very senior representatives of the UAE last week in support of international efforts to restart oil production in Libya,"" the NOC said in a statement.

The UAE hasn't responded publicly to the NOC's accusation, but its minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, tweeted on Monday that his country ""wants to see a return to oil production in Libya as soon as possible, with safeguards in place to prevent the proceeds fueling further conflict. We continue to work for an immediate cease-fire and return to a political process.""

Libya has been at the center of a proxy war between various regional powers, and remains divided between a United Nations-recognized government in the capital Tripoli, where the NOC has its headquarters, and a competing administration based in the east.

Haftar's blockade, which started in January, sent Libyan crude production crashing to about 100,000 barrels a day from 1.2 million, and has cost the country $7 billion in lost revenue, according to the central bank. Libya's output was as high as 1.6 million barrels daily in early 2011 before an uprising ousted longtime leader Moammar Qaddafi and led to the civil war.

Dilapidated Industry

Libya's oil facilities have been key to the conflict, with different groups repeatedly closing them. The shutdowns and lack of maintenance have severely damaged fields and wells, which will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to repair, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in an interview in June.

A Russian mercenary force, the Wagner Group, and Syrian mercenaries now occupy Es Sider port, while Wagner and Sudanese mercenaries are camped near the Sharara oil field, the NOC said.

There must be ""consequences for the actions of the handful of states that are undermining the rule-based international order and destroying Libya,"" Sanalla said in the statement. ""The renewed blockade demonstrates the urgent need for moves to improve financial transparency, to be accompanied by reform of security at oil installations.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Dubai', 'Russia', 'Egypt', 'Tripoli', 'Syria', 'Sudan']","Libya halts oil exports again, blaming UAE for tanker blockade",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/7/13/libya-halts-oil-exports-again-blaming-uae-for-tanker-blockade,None,
11402911,2020-07-09,"NEW YORK (Bloomberg) - Crude slid after a key Libyan oil field resumed production, threatening to unleash barrels into a market where demand is already lackluster.

U.S. oil futures fell as much as 3% on Thursday after trading in a tight range this week. The Messla oil field and Sarir refinery in eastern Libya resumed production after a technical problem forced a shutdown. Meanwhile, rising global coronavirus cases and reports of layoffs at companies from Wells Fargo & Co. to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. are dampening the potential of a demand recovery later this year.

""The global market is going to have a difficult time absorbing these additional Libyan barrels,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. At the same time, there is going to be ""tens of thousands of layoffs of folks who are going to be out of work and not driving. All of a sudden there's a real focus on the potential for the bottom to drop out for oil demand here.""

The U.S. benchmark crude rebounded from a plunge below zero in April, but the recovery has been limited with futures trapped near $40-a-barrel in the wake of near-record high stockpiles and rising virus cases across America. In the U.S., California and Texas recorded some of their biggest daily increases in cases and deaths this week. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying Brent futures over West Texas Intermediate as American inventories grow.

Still, in the UK, job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic accelerated with retailers Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and John Lewis joining Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc in detailing plans to cut more than 8,000 workers. Wells Fargo & Co., the largest employer among U.S. banks, is also preparing to cut thousands of jobs starting later this year.

Further complicating market dynamics, tankers that had been storing much of the world's oil as demand cratered due to the pandemic are beginning to offload cargoes. In key locations outside Asia, floating inventories have halved to about 35 million barrels since peaking in May, according to Vortexa Ltd., an analytics firm.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['United States', 'Libya', 'California', 'Texas', 'United Kingdom']",Oil prices slide as Libyan production threatens demand balance,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/7/9/oil-prices-slide-as-libyan-production-threatens-demand-balance,None,
11402912,2020-07-05,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) --Libya will export two oil cargoes totaling 1.2 million barrels in July -- a third less than in June -- as forces opposed to the Tripoli-based government continue to block shipments from most of the OPEC member's ports.

The Bouri and Farwah terminals will each ship one cargo of 600,000 barrels, according to an initial loading program seen by Bloomberg. That compares with 1.8 million barrels shipped for all of June.

Although Libya holds Africa's largest crude reserves, its production has plummeted to about 110,000 barrels a day, from 1.2 million last year. That's largely because supporters of Khalifa Haftar, an eastern commander fighting against the United Nations-backed government, have halted flows from many fields and ports.

The National Oil Corp., the state energy firm, said on Wednesday that force majeure remained in place for all shipments. Force majeure is a legal status protecting a party from liability if it can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control.

However, the NOC has instructed oil companies to prepare for a resumption of operations ""in light of the ongoing negotiations"" between it, the U.S. and regional powers to lift the blockade. A tanker is approaching the eastern Es Sider port to load crude, according to the NOC.

The supply shutdown has cost Libya more than $6 billion in lost revenue this year. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Bloomberg last month the country will need a lot of time and hundreds of millions of dollars to revive its energy industry, even if the fighting stops soon.

Any increase in Libyan supply could make it harder for the OPEC+ coalition to limit global output. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia are seeking to re-balance crude markets and prop up prices after they crashed with the spread of the coronavirus. Brent crude is down 35% this year.

11402913,2020-06-30,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) --Tribes in eastern Libya backed the resumption of oil production from their region, shortly after the state energy company said negotiations between the U.S. and regional governments could lead to a restart of exports from the war-battered OPEC member.

The tribes, which helped shutdown most energy facilities in the east in January, will back rebel commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army in negotiations with the United Nations over the distribution of oil revenue, Ibrahim Bouhreba al-Baraassi, a member of one of the groups, told Bloomberg on Monday.

The announcement came after the state-run National Oil Corp. said it was in talks with Libya's UN-recognized government in Tripoli, the U.S. and some Middle Eastern powers. The NOC and Washington have called on supporters of Haftar, who's backed in Libya's civil war by Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, to end their blockade of the nation's oil ports and fields.

""We are hopeful that those regional countries will lift the blockade and allow us to resume our work for the benefit of all the Libyan people,"" the NOC said, without identifying the nations. An agreement should ""protect the oil facilities and make sure they are never used as a military target or a political bargaining chip again.""

Libya's exports have plummeted to less than 100,000 barrels a day from 1.1 million because of the shut downs. The NOC has said that neglect and damage from the conflict, which began in 2011 after the ouster of former leader Moammar Qaddafi, means it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to restore output fully.

Haftar, who's based in the east, launched a western offensive and was close to taking the capital, Tripoli, earlier this year, which would have effectively given him control of the country. Turkey intervened on behalf of the Tripoli government of Fayez al-Sarraj and pushed Haftar's forces back toward Sirte. The two sides are poised to square off in the central city close to Libya's ""oil crescent"" -- where some of its largest fields and export terminals lie.

The NOC said last week that Russian and other mercenaries had entered the western oil field of Sharara, the nation's biggest, to prevent production from restarting.

""Many oil-producing countries are benefiting from the ongoing oil blockade and are taking advantage of the absence of the Libyan oil from global markets,"" Mustafa Sanalla, the NOC's chairman, said on Monday following a meeting with the European Union's ambassador to the country.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Cairo', 'Tripoli', 'Russia', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Sirte', 'Turkey']",Libyan oil output could resume on U.S.-backed negotiations,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/6/30/libyan-oil-output-could-resume-on-us-backed-negotiations,None,
11402914,2020-06-25,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) --Libya's oil industry is crumbling after more than nine years of neglected maintenance amid a civil war that's killed thousands and destroyed towns across the country.

The lack of basic, nuts-and-bolts servicing has left pipelines corroding and storage tanks collapsing. Remedial work at wells alone could cost more than $100 million, the head of the state-run National Oil Corp. told Bloomberg, and that's money the government can ill afford.

The damage means that Libya, despite having Africa's largest crude reserves, will struggle to ramp up production quickly even if the conflict abates soon. Fighters are poised now for what could be a decisive battle at Sirte, a city just a two-hour drive from the so-called oil crescent -- a cluster of export terminals for most of the nation's crude.

Libya produces about 90,000 barrels a day. That's a fraction of the 1.6 million that companies such as Eni SpA and Repsol SA pumped in partnership with the NOC before the ouster of strongman Moammar Al Qaddafi in 2011 and the catastrophic war that followed. Until now, the NOC has usually succeeded in restoring operations quickly after regaining control of oil facilities shut due to fighting. That resilience, however, is fraying.

""The longer we wait, the greater the damage and the higher the cost,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a written response to questions. ""It is a tragedy for the people of Libya that political game-playing has been allowed to cause such damage to our country's critical national infrastructure.""

The political turmoil has left Libya divided between a United Nations-recognized government in the capital Tripoli, where the NOC has its headquarters, and a competing administration based in the east. Since January, when supporters of the eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar shut most of the country's oil fields and ports, daily output has plunged by more than a million barrels.

The Tripoli government of Fayez al-Sarraj, backed by Turkey, appears for now to have the upper hand on the battlefield. Its troops repulsed Haftar's western offensive and have advanced as far as Sirte, on the central coast, which the rebels still control. When Haftar, who has support from Russia and Egypt, called a cease-fire this month, the government rejected it, saying it would first capture Sirte and an air base called Jufra.

Armed groups forced Libya's biggest oil field of Sharara to stop production twice this month, and they also closed the nearby El-Feel deposit. Both southwestern fields had only just re-opened after halting in January.

The NOC's lack of access to Sharara prevented workers from injecting chemicals into a pipeline to stop corrosion. A 16,000-barrel tank that handles overflows, or surges, collapsed last month as a result, Sanalla said.

""We are deeply concerned about corrosion in the pipelines,"" he said. ""Due to the disruption of exports, crude oil has stayed in the pipelines, which has environmental and other implications that will not be easy to address in the future.""

Harouge Oil Operations, a joint venture between the NOC and Canada's Suncor Energy Inc., blames corrosion for at least 80 leaks at its facilities from January to May, Sanalla said. Harouge exports crude from Libya's third-largest oil port at Ras Lanuf.

""Throughout the last nine years, Libyan production has been able to rebound,"" said Mohammad Darwazah, an analyst at consultant Medley Global Advisors. ""But many fields require urgent maintenance, and damage sustained to storage depots at the eastern terminals has not been fully repaired, limiting how quickly fields can ramp up.""

Prolonged shutdowns have reduced the pressure that wells need to spout oil. On earlier occasions when Sharara re-opened, it took just a few days to restore production to around 300,000 barrels a day. This time, the field will need around three months to recover, according to the NOC.

How to pay for the repairs is an open question; the NOC said Sunday that blockades of fields and ports by Haftar's supporters have deprived Libya of $6 billion in potential oil revenue since January.

""Sustained under-funding of the state operator and multiyear delays to field and asset maintenance will make the challenge of a resumption greater this time around,"" said Bill Farren-Price, a director at consultant RS Energy Group Canada Inc.

Any increase in Libyan supply could jar efforts by the OPEC+ coalition to limit global production. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia are seeking to rebalance crude markets and prop up prices after they crashed with the spread of the coronavirus early in the year. Brent crude has more than doubled since late April, but at around $40 a barrel it's still down 40% this year.

Libya, an OPEC member, is exempt from the output cuts, due to the nation's strife.

For energy analysts and traders, the rot in Libya's oil facilities makes it that much tougher to predict when production will pick up.

""Even if a peace deal is reached, its durability and impact on oil production remain uncertain,"" analysts at Citigroup Inc., including Francesco Martoccia, said in a note this month. ""The NOC is also confronting a steep natural decline rate of roughly 8% per year, which requires capital expenditures to at least marginally offset it.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Sirte', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Cairo', 'South Africa', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Egypt', 'Jufra District', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Canada']",Civil war's end won't be enough to revive Libyan oil production,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/6/25/civil-war-s-end-won-t-be-enough-to-revive-libyan-oil-production,None,

Futures dropped 2.4% in New York. The American Petroleum Institute reported that stockpiles expanded by 8.42 million barrels last week, according to people familiar with the data. If confirmed by government figures later on Wednesday, it would be the largest build since the end of April. Inventories at a key European hub jumped to a two-year high last week, Genscape Inc. reported.

Oil's recovery from the virus-driven demand crash and swollen stockpiles remains uneven. Consumption is showing signs of uptick in India, where Indian Oil Corp. is boosting processing at its refineries this month. Still, the OECD is forecasting a sharp contraction in the global economy this year, and one that could get worse if there's a second wave of virus infections.

""Indications from the American Petroleum Institute show that stocks built quite a lot,"" said Rystad Energy head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhaugen. ""Shut-in production returning and a rise in Covid-19 cases scare traders - and markets.""

Prices

The weakness in crude prices has also been accompanied by a softer market structure in recent days. Brent futures for August were at their biggest discount to September this month on Wednesday. Similarly key swaps that help price North Sea crude have softened so far this week, according to data from brokerage Eagle Commodities.

Meanwhile, the chaos engulfing OPEC member Libya continued, with the Sharara field stopping production after armed men entered the site Monday and told employees to end activities. Though operations were briefly allowed to resume, according to people with knowledge of the situation, the group halted output again for the second time in a day, the Tripoli-based National Oil Co. said on its Facebook page.

Supplies of U.S. distillates, which include diesel, rose by 4.27 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, fell by 2.29 million barrels, the API reported.

11402916,2020-06-08,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) --Libya took another step toward reviving its moribund oil industry by restarting production at a second important field after a five-month halt.

Pumping began on Sunday at the El-Feel deposit, which had suspended operations due to the North African country's civil war. El-Feel is resuming just a day after oil started flowing again from Libya's largest deposit, Sharara.

Any fresh barrels from these fields could complicate efforts by the OPEC+ producer alliance to limit global supply and push crude prices higher. The group agreed on Saturday to extend historic production cuts of 9.6 million barrels a day until July. Libya, with Africa's largest oil reserves, is exempted from the cuts due to the country's strife.

The two southwestern fields previously pumped a combined 400,000 barrels a day, though they could take months to return to that level of output, if they reach it at all.

Operations are gradually resuming at El-Feel, which is operated by a joint venture between Italy's SpA and the state-run National Oil Corp., according to a person with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified. The NOC wasn't immediately available for comment. Sharara came back online a day earlier.

Output at the fields halted in January amid a military offensive by forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, a commander based in eastern Libya. His fighters shut down most of the country's crude production, which plunged from 1.2 million barrels a day to some 90,000. The collapse has cost the oil-dependent nation billions of dollars in lost revenue.

The resumption of production at the two fields follows setbacks for Haftar in recent weeks. His forces have lost strongholds in western Libya after battling for more than a year to seize the capital, Tripoli, from the United Nations-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj.

Haftar has accepted an Egyptian-sponsored cease-fire, though Sarraj's administration said Sunday that government forces would continue their campaign to retake two key cities before any political negotiations to end the war.

The NOC on Sunday said production at Sharara will resume at an initial 30,000 barrels a day and will take three months to return to full capacity, due to damage caused by the shutdown. However, a return to full production at either field probably won't happen without a truce between Haftar's Libyan National Army and Sarraj's Government of National Accord.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Cairo', 'Italy', 'Tripoli']","Second Libyan oil field restarts, potentially complicating OPEC+ deal",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/6/8/second-libyan-oil-field-restarts-potentially-complicating-opecplus-deal,None,
11402917,2020-06-03,"ANKARA (Bloomberg) - Turkey vowed to defend its interests in the eastern Mediterranean, where it's preparing to issue new energy exploration licenses over the objections of Greece and the European Union.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan chaired a National Security Council meeting late Tuesday at which civilian and military leaders discussed ""activities of some countries against Turkey's interests in the Mediterranean,"" according to a statement.

""Turkey will continue to defend its rights and interests in the land, air and sea without any concession,"" the council said.

The eastern Mediterranean has become an energy hot spot with big finds for EU member Cyprus, Israel and Egypt in recent years, and Turkey's push to secure a share of the resources in those waters has exacerbated strains in an already tumultuous region.

""Greece, Egypt and some other countries have tried to exclude us"" from energy sharing in the Mediterranean, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told TV24 television in an interview on Wednesday. ""Any deal that excludes Turkey can't survive and is not valid, we won't allow any fait accompli.""

Having sent troops to northern Cyprus after a 1974 coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece, Ankara vehemently opposes Cypriot drilling without an agreement on sharing any proceeds. It also struck an accord with Libya on their maritime boundary that led Erdogan to declare rights to parts of the seabed that Athens say is Greek under international law.

In return, Turkey has given military support to Libya's internationally recognized government, turning the tide in its war against militia commander Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russian mercenaries. The National Security Council statement expressed continued ""military support"" for the government of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

""Haftar can't win this war,"" Cavusoglu said.

While European nations, Egypt and Israel have built a forum to promote their interests, Turkey deployed its own exploration ships under the protection of its navy and air force.

Turkey's state-run oil company, TPAO, officially sought new exploration licenses in the Mediterranean last week. It's preparing to expand its exploration activities closer toward the Greek island of Crete while drilling for oil and gas off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus at the same time.

""The fact that NATO allies are staring each other down on the European Union's doorstep should cause all Europeans to pay greater attention to the region,"" the European Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a recent report.

11402918,2020-05-21,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) - The revival of Libya's oil industry looks even less certain following recent setbacks suffered by Khalifa Haftar, the commander trying to take over the last swaths of the country outside his control.

Forces aligned with Fayez al-Sarraj, the prime minister recognized by the United Nations, this week overran the Watiya air base near the capital, Tripoli, in a major blow to Haftar.

The Russian-backed general effectively rules the country's eastern and southern regions, and has been trying to conquer Tripoli in the west for more than a year. He halted almost all the OPEC member's crude production in January to pile pressure on Sarraj to surrender.

Haftar has long complained that Tripoli, which receives all of the nation's oil revenue via the central bank, distributes the money unfairly and to the disadvantage of the historically marginalized east.

Sarraj, who's supported by Turkey, may now be in a position to attempt to restart the western fields of Sharara, Libya's biggest, and El-Feel. But Haftar's past actions suggest he won't end his blockade of oil ports or allow other fields to open unless he gets a deal giving him a greater proportion of Libya's energy receipts.

""There may be attempts to restart southwestern oil fields but sustained production is something else,"" said Bill Farren-Price, a director at Canadian consultancy RS Energy Group. ""The bulk of Libya's oil production is likely to continue to be disrupted until there are signs that the political process is moving again. That will probably require better international engagement, which is absent right now.""

Libya's exports, now just 90,000 barrels a day, stood at 1.2 million in late 2019. Sharara and El-Feel accounted for roughly 400,000 of those. If they came back onstream, it would offset a fraction of the output cuts by OPEC and its allies that have helped Brent crude prices soar 90% in the past month to around $36 a barrel.

Libya, which has Africa's largest oil reserves, is exempt from those curbs. The country has been in disarray since a 2011 uprising that led to former leader Muammar Qaddafi's ouster. Its crude output has never recovered to the level before then of 1.6 million barrels per day.

A return to full production probably won't happen until there's a truce between Haftar's Libyan National Army and Sarraj's Government of National Accord, or until one of them defeats the other.

Haftar is in no mood to back down. His air force said it would soon start ""the largest aerial campaign in Libyan history"" to strike Turkish targets.

""Haftar is definitely suffering a military reversal in and around Tripoli,"" said Farren-Price. ""But it seems unlikely at this point that the GNA forces will be able to force a military victory.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Cairo', 'Turkey']",Libyan oil uncertainty grows as crippling civil war drags on,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/5/21/libyan-oil-uncertainty-grows-as-crippling-civil-war-drags-on,None,
11402919,2020-05-05,"PARIS (Bloomberg) --Total SA set out bolder commitments to eliminate most of its carbon emissions by 2050, while curbing spending on oil and gas projects due to the crude-price slump.

The French company's commitment to invest more in clean energy, despite a sharp drop in profit as the coronavirus hammers fuel demand, illustrates the enduring pressure on oil giants from investors and society to tackle long-term environmental challenges.

After a weak round of first-quarter earnings, oil supermajors have been forced to slash spending, curb production and even reduce their dividends in some cases. It could get worse in the months ahead as the public health crisis destroys as much as a third of global energy demand.

""While responsibly taking on the short-term challenges, the group continues to implement its medium and long-term strategy,"" Chief Executive officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement on Tuesday.

Total's shares rose 6% to 32.32 euros at 10:22 a.m. in Paris, almost three times the gain in France's benchmark index.

Playing Catchup. Total has invested billions of dollars in recent years in batteries, wind and solar energy, but it is also catching up with European rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Repsol SA, which have already set ambitious climate targets.

The French company aims to have net-zero emissions from its own worldwide operations, known as scope 1 and 2, by 2050 or sooner. It's targeting carbon neutrality for all its production and energy products used by its customers in Europe -- known as scope 3 emissions -- by 2050 or earlier.

Total wants to cut the average carbon intensity of energy products used worldwide by its customers by at least 60% by 2050, with intermediate steps of 15% by 2030 and 35% by 2040.

That's similar to pledges made by its European peers, who have also reiterated their commitment to the transition to clean energy despite being under immense financial pressure due to a historic slump in oil and gas prices.

Total, which currently allocates more than 10% of its capital expenditure to low carbon electricity, will increase that share to 20% by 2030 or sooner.

The company had stakes in 3 gigawatts of renewable-power capacity at the end of last year, and is targeting 25 gigawatts by 2025. It recently took stakes in giant solar projects in India and Qatar, and has expanded clean power in Spain, the U.K. and France.

Total's first-quarter adjusted net income fell 35% from a year earlier to $1.78 billion, the company based near Paris said. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast $1.57 billion on average.

To ease financial pressures, the company decided to reduce its overall investments this year to below $14 billion, down from a March target of less than $15 billion and a February target of $18 billion. The company maintained its goal of spending as much as $2 billion in low-carbon power in 2020.

It will cut operational spending by more than $1 billion, a deeper reduction than a target of $800 million set back in March, and expects to save at least another $1 billion in energy costs.

Total also offered to pay part of its final 2019 dividend of 68 euro cents in shares, known as the scrip, rather than cash. It set the first quarter dividend at 66 euro cents, unchanged from a year earlier.

""The key questions are how long Total intends to utilize a scrip dividend for, and also how far it is willing to push the balance sheet to maintain the dividend as it stands,"" RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria wrote in a note. ""While this is not ideal, and clearly destroys value over the long term -- given the recent sell-off, we think the market will take some relief in Total not cutting its headline dividends like peer Shell.""

Royal Dutch Shell Plc last week surprised the market by reducing its payout for the first time since at least the Second World War. Norway's Equinor ASA also slashed its dividend and Exxon Mobil Corp. froze it for the first time in 13 years.

Citing lower global demand and the turmoil in Libya, the company now expects oil and gas production of between 2.95 million and 3 million of barrels per day, a reduction of at least 5% from its initial forecast.

Liquefied natural gas deliveries may be deferred in the second and third quarters, while the drop in oil prices will hurt long-term LNG contract prices from the second half, Total said.

11402920,2020-04-13,"MOSCOW (Bloomberg) --Vladimir Putin's deal with OPEC to cut oil output and boost prices three years ago was a triumph for the Russian leader, bolstering his clout on the global stage. But now he's had to make stinging concessions after U.S. President Donald Trump stepped in to end a price war.

Amid relief in Moscow at the unprecedented deal with Saudi Arabia and other major producers to slash oil output, the accord marks a painful setback for Russia, said two people close to the Kremlin.

Putin had catapulted Russia into a dominant role in global energy politics and drove a wedge between the U.S. and its Saudi ally, as the two marshaled producers to limit supplies. But it's now clear he overplayed his hand when he refused to meet Saudi demands to double output cuts just five weeks ago. OPEC's biggest producer cranked up output in a price war that crashed the market just as the spread of coronavirus demolished demand.

With markets collapsing, Putin agreed to cut more than 2.5 million barrels a day of crude from the 11 million of combined crude and condensate Russia pumps each day, more than four times the reduction that he turned down in early March and more than what Saudi Arabia is obliged to cut from its output level last month. Meanwhile, hopes that the U.S. would formally commit to its own curbs have evaporated, even as Trump takes credit for bringing about the new deal.

The ill-fated decision to face off against Saudi Arabia in early March was ""a strategic mistake and now we're paying the price, a much higher price than we could have paid,"" said Andrey Kortunov, director of the Kremlin-founded Russian International Affairs Council. ""This looks like a victory for the U.S., and Russia ends up a bigger loser than Saudi Arabia.""

If the cuts are achieved, Russia's output for the next two months will drop to the annual average last seen in 2003, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the Russian Energy Ministry and BP Plc's Statistical Review. Russia agreed to continue smaller cuts until May 2022, though it did manage to hold onto one concession by keeping condensate, a light fuel of which it is a major producer, out of the quotas.

But Russia completely failed to anticipate the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the world economy when it walked away from the agreement with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big producers known as OPEC+, said a senior Russian official. Holding that alliance together would have prevented the collapse in prices to an almost two-decade low that followed. Now, the Kremlin has had to negotiate a new arrangement under highly unfavorable terms, he said.

The decision to compromise over the cuts to crude output is painful for Putin's political image, but it's essential as a step toward overcoming the crisis, said another person close to the Kremlin. The final agreement, which foresees a gradual lifting of the supply restrictions starting from July, was coordinated with all major Russian oil companies and had Putin's personal stamp of approval. Even symbolic U.S. participation is seen as an important milestone.

Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, defended the new deal Friday. ""There are no losers, there are only winners,"" he told reporters on a conference call. The main state TV news program hailed the pact as an ""unconditional success"" on Sunday.

Economic Pain. But the deal marks a reversal in Putin's push to restore Russia's global influence, especially in the Middle East, where he's become a key player with interventions in places like Libya and Syria. Just how big a setback it is will be determined by whether the new deal is enough to reverse the market rout and limit the economic pain for the Kremlin.

While Russian officials had put on a brave face in recent weeks as oil prices plunged, dragging the ruble sharply lower and forcing the central bank to sell dollars to steady the market, the Kremlin had become alarmed at the potential economic damage.

""Russia was seriously concerned about the Urals drop, in early April the price fell to almost $10 per barrel,"" said Dmitry Marinchenko, senior director at Fitch Ratings, referring to Russia's main export blend. ""It's difficult to imagine how the Russian budget would cope with a situation when the oil industry doesn't bring any revenues at all.""

Lukoil PJSC's billionaire shareholder Leonid Fedun likened the deal to the ""humiliating and difficult"" pact the Bolsheviks signed in 1918 to end Russia's participation in World War I. Still, he told the RBC news group the pact will save the country's oil industry from a production collapse of as much as 50% if low prices forced a ""blanket"" shuttering of wells.

Role Reversal. Moscow's climbdown marks a dramatic role reversal. Due to climate and geography, Saudi Arabia can turn the taps on and off much more easily than Russia and, until now, Russia had dawdled on cuts, avoiding full compliance while Saudi Arabia bore the brunt of the output curbs to maintain market stability.

To meet the new conditions, Russian producers may have to go beyond cutting flows from their existing high-cost, fully taxed fields and review plans for new projects, said Darya Kozlova, head of oil and gas regulation at Moscow-based Vygon Consulting. That could have implications for years to come.

Russia may also have to provide cheaper supplies to traditional buyers in Europe to woo them back after Saudi Arabia offered deep discounts during their five-week standoff.

""This is Russia's biggest defeat since the start of the 2000s,"" said Dmitry Perevalov, an independent oil trader and former industry executive. ""We've lost our markets and it won't be easy to get them back.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Moscow', 'United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Syria', 'Libya']",Russia paid a heavy price to end the oil price war,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/13/russia-paid-a-heavy-price-to-end-the-oil-price-war,None,
11402921,2020-03-24,"DUBAI (Bloomberg) --With OPEC's output limits suspended and a price war under way, the group's biggest oil producers are preparing to churn out more barrels to protect market share.

But making up in volume for what they're losing in price is looking increasingly difficult as the coronavirus pandemic eviscerates demand. What's more, some producers, like Iraq and Libya, are facing political and security stumbling blocks to increasing production.

Here's a list of where the spare capacity is located and what obstacles could block it:

Saudi Arabia

The world's biggest crude exporter has historically maintained the largest amount of spare capacity, allowing it to add output to dampen price swings in the case of supply interruptions elsewhere. Now, state producer Saudi Aramco is bringing those extra barrels to bear as the kingdom unleashes a price war and plans to flood markets with crude.

Aramco is boosting production to its maximum capacity of 12 million barrels a day from an average of around 10 million over the last three years. The company said it will supply more than that -- 12.3 million barrels a day -- in April by tapping storage for some barrels and that it's working to raise capacity to 13 million barrels daily.

Russia

Moscow, whose intransigence in the face of deeper proposed output cuts led to the collapse of the OPEC+ alliance, responded to Riyadh's planned production hike with a similar declaration.

Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Russia had the ability to boost production by 500,000 barrels a day, to a record high potential output of 11.8 million barrels a day. Russia's state oil company Rosneft PJSC plans to increase output by 300,000 barrels a day, probably as soon as April 1.

It is not clear how much of Russia's production increase will result in higher exports. Before Russia entered the price war it intended to export around 1.85 million barrels a day by sea in March, less than the 2 million barrels a day it shipped in February.

Iraq

The second-biggest producer in OPEC may not have many barrels to add as it pumped near capacity even during the three years that the group implemented output curbs. Still, Iraq aims to export about 250,000 barrels a day more in April than it did in February from fields in the south and center of the country that are controlled by the central government.

Boosting central government sales to 3.7 million barrels a day, along with the roughly 450,000 barrels that the semi-autonomous Kurdish zone in Iraq's north exported daily on average over the past year, would bring Iraqi exports to the highest since September, according to tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.

Some obstacles could hamper the effort. The last time prices dropped this low, Iraqi production growth stalled as the government couldn't pay international oil companies operating in the country. Now it is facing a coronavirus-related closure at one of its fields, and others are still operating normally.

United Arab Emirates

The Saudi ally was caught out by the collapse of the agreement between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners like Russia earlier this month. But it's not losing any time reacting to Saudi and Russian pledges to add supply.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will supply 4 million barrels a day of crude in April as the government producer speeds up plans to increase maximum capacity to that level. That will be some 1 million barrels more than the U.A.E. pumped in February and boost capacity from the 3.4 million available that month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adnoc is accelerating plans to raise capacity to 5 million barrels a day, though it didn't say when it will reach that goal.

Kuwait

Along with Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., Kuwait is one of the Gulf countries with the most spare capacity. The country has been pumping on average some 400,000 barrels a day below its 3.1 million-barrel limit since OPEC+ started its output cuts in 2017.

Kuwait won't meet its long-held target of 4 million barrels a day capacity by this year. The country will get a boost as it resumes some of the 500,000 barrels a day of maximum production available in the Neutral Zone area it shares with Saudi Arabia.

Oman

The biggest Gulf producer that's not an OPEC member doesn't have much fuel to add to the fire. The sultanate can pump as much as 1 million barrels a day and is likely to gradually ramp up to that level, according to an oil ministry official. The country's long-term buyers have already asked about the availability of additional barrels, so any hike likely won't hit the market directly.

Libya, Nigeria

The African producers have long pumped below their potential, hampered by internal strife and civil war. Should such difficulties subside, the producers could add more than 1 million barrels a day to the market, though it is considered unlikely in the short term.

Iran

Under U.S. sanctions that restrict its sales, Iran's actual output is uncertain. The country is pumping about half its full capacity of near 4 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg data. With coronavirus ravaging the country and sanctions still in place, it's unlikely Iran can ramp up production or sales.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Russia', 'Iraq', 'Dubai', 'Moscow', 'Riyadh', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Libya', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Oman', 'Kuwait', 'Nigeria', 'Iran']",These countries have the most firepower in the oil price war,http://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/3/24/these-countries-have-the-most-firepower-in-the-oil-price-war,None,

The company also announced a new $1.0 billion three-year term loan agreement. These actions further strengthen the company's cash position and financial liquidity in response to the sharp decline in oil prices.

""With 80% of our oil production hedged in 2020, our significantly reduced capital and exploratory budget and our new three-year loan agreement, our company is well positioned for this low-price environment,"" CEO John Hess said. ""Our focus is on preserving cash and protecting our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana.""

The reductions to the company's 2020 capital budget will be primarily achieved by shifting from a six-rig program to one rig in the Bakken, which is expected to be completed by the end of May. Most discretionary exploration and offshore drilling activities, excluding Guyana, will also be deferred.

On March 16, 2020, the company entered into a $1.0 billion three-year term loan agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The term loan contains provisions that require the company to reduce JPMorgan's initial funded amount, which the company intends to do by syndicating the loan to other banks.

In 2020, approximately 80% of the company's oil production is hedged by put options, with 130,000 barrels a day at $55 per barrel West Texas Intermediate put options and 20,000 barrels a day at $60 per barrel Brent put options. In addition, the company entered 2020 with more than $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet and has a $3.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until 2027.

11402923,2020-02-27,"BRUSSELS (Bloomberg) - The European Union blacklisted two Turkish nationals as retaliation over Ankara's energy drilling off Cyprus in a move that has more political symbolism than economic punch.

The EU asset freezes and travel bans on the two people, whom the bloc plans to identify later on Thursday, make good on its months-long vow to counter Turkey's oil and natural-gas exploration in waters that are part of the exclusive economic zone of member country Cyprus. The sanctions also are the first of their kind in response to the actions of a nation seeking to join the EU.

At the same time, the decision by EU governments in Brussels stops short of targeting any Turkish companies. This reflects a desire to avoid antagonizing a key ally in the fight to prevent Middle East migration, particularly from war-torn Syria.

""Hanging in the balance is a possible influx of Syrian refugees into Europe,"" said Michael Emerson of the CEPS think tank in the Belgian capital. ""It's a highly sensitive political issue in the EU.""

Relations between the EU and Turkey have been deteriorating since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded to a failed coup attempt in mid-2016 by unleashing a widespread crackdown on political opponents.

Ties soured further in 2018 when the Turkish navy prevented drilling by Italy-based Eni SpA in Cypriot waters and again late last year, when Turkey carried out a military operation in northern Syria to carve out a buffer zone and struck a controversial accord with Libya on their maritime boundary.

The acrimony has halted negotiations on a bid for EU membership by Turkey, which has been seeking to join the bloc since the 1980s and began accession talks in 2005. The energy-exploration tensions are a reminder of the most basic European disagreement with Turkey: its occupation of the northern part of Cyprus since a 1974 invasion.

Nonetheless, the EU is counting on Erdogan to uphold a 2016 agreement that stemmed a politically explosive flood of Mideast refugees into the bloc via Greece and European leaders are keen to keep channels of communication with Ankara open. As part of the migrant accord, the EU pledged 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) to help Turkey handle migrants.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Brussels', 'Turkey', 'Cyprus', 'Ankara', 'Syria', 'Belgium', 'Libya', 'Greece']",EU sanctions Turkey over drilling in Cyprus' economic zone,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/2/27/eu-sanctions-turkey-over-drilling-in-cyprus-economic-zone,None,
11402924,2020-02-19,"SINGAPORE (Bloomberg) - Oil rose to a two-week high on hopes that economic stimulus from China can revive demand battered by the coronavirus, and as a number of OPEC nations faced threats to their production.

Brent futures increased for a seventh day, the longest run of gains since early 2019, even as Chinese refineries slashed processing by 25% from last year as the virus hit travel and economic activity.

Crude is being supported along with equities by signs that China, the world's biggest oil importer, is considering steps to shore up its economy, such as direct cash infusions and mergers to revive its airline industry.

Prices are also drawing support from a range of supply disruptions.

Cease-fire talks were suspended in OPEC member Libya after the capital's port was shelled by forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Haftar, who has choked off the country's exports. And Venezuela's ability to export crude was further threatened as the U.S. sanctioned a unit of Russia's Rosneft PJSC for maintaining ties with President Nicolas Maduro and the state-run oil company.

""The Rosneft story and the outage in Libya could help make the market less oversupplied in the first quarter,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG in Zurich. Equities are also lending support to crude, he said, citing expectations that ""this virus situation will all be sorted out at some stage.""

Brent for April settlement climbed 79 cents, or 1.4%, to $58.54 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 10:29 a.m. in London, after gaining more than 8% in the past six sessions. West Texas Intermediate for March delivery advanced 71 cents, or 1.4%, to $52.76.

Besides the involuntary losses in OPEC countries, the cartel and its partners are contemplating deepening the deliberate production cutbacks they've made this year. A committee representing the OPEC+ alliance recommended earlier this month that the producers should curb supply by a further 600,000 barrels a day to offset the impact of the coronavirus.

Rosneft Trading, the main exporter of Venezuelan crude, was targeted by the U.S. for helping to sell the commodity that bankrolls Maduro's regime. The sanctions are the toughest in the U.S. Treasury's arsenal and render Rosneft Trading effectively untouchable to international companies, including shipowners, insurers and banks.

Meanwhile, the latest attack in Libya forced authorities to evacuate tankers carrying gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas before they had unloaded, according to an official from state-run National Oil Corp. The nation's crude output has dropped to around 123,000 barrels a day from 1.2 million a day before a blockade of ports by Haftar's supporters started in mid-January.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['China', 'Singapore', 'Libya', 'Venezuela', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Zürich', 'London']",Oil reaches two-week high on hope for Chinese demand revival,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/2/19/oil-reaches-two-week-high-on-hope-for-chinese-demand-revival,None,
11402925,2020-02-18,"Improved offshore activity, coupled with significant conventional oil development programs operated by NOCs, should push drilling marginally higher in 2020.

Even though drilling took a dive during 2019, the U.S. became the world's largest crude producer, reaching a record-high 12.87 MMbopd in December, and averaged 12.2 MMbpd for the year. To avoid an oil price crash, OPEC+ decided to cut production, with 1.195 MMbpd pledged. Actually, production in December was only 44.081 MMbpd, resulting in a 1.569-MMbpd reduction. The cutbacks were enough to balance markets and keep benchmark prices relatively steady.

Geopolitical factors also caused occasional price spikes, but oil prices, on the whole, remained within a fairly constant range between the low $50s/bbl and $60/bbl. The industry's top-performing region remains the Middle East, supported by multi-year development programs. And while Qatar has been the world's leading LNG exporter, Australia may claim that title shortly.

The aforementioned factors, along with World Oil's surveys of international petroleum ministries and departments have all shaped this cycle's forecasting process. Accordingly, World Oil's editorial staff forecasts 2020 international E&P activity, as follows:

After two years of improvement in global drilling outside the U.S., the number of wells drilled last year fell 4.0%, to 43,734, Table 1.

This year, we predict that global drilling will inch up 0.3%, to 43,879 wells. Offshore activity continues to rebound, with a 4.7% pick-up to 2,411 wells forecast, Table 2.

Outside the U.S., North American drilling is slated to decline 7.1% during 2020, with Canada down and Mexico up. Offshore activity in these two nations should rise 16.4%, to 85 wells.

Canada. After a wild ride for producers over the last several years, the Canadian E&P outlook is a bit better for 2020. What's really needed, however, is approval of pipeline projects that would add nearly 600,000 bpd of shipping capacity. In the short run, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers expects drilling to decline another 8.4% during 2020, with offshore work remaining nearly flat.

Mexico. Compared to several previous years, Mexico in 2019 under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) seemed to step backwards. Since taking office, AMLO has suspended licensing rounds but left existing agreements with private operators in effect.

Furthermore, an effort by state firm Pemex to drill new wells at 20 ""priority"" fields by using smaller, local service contractors has faltered, and the company expects to re-bid some of the work later this year. Meanwhile, AMLO appears bent on restoring Pemex to its pre-reform status. He said that he would lower the company's tax burden in 2020 and contribute government funds toward paying down near-term bonds. Accordingly, we expect Mexican drilling, at least the Pemex share, to be up 20.9% during 2020, Fig. 1.

This region has good resources, but it suffers inconsistent performance. Yet, drilling appears close to turning the corner, with just a 1.5% decline in wells forecast. Offshore activity is on the rebound, slated to rise 28%.

Brazil leads in offshore development. The country reportedly will deploy 21 FPSOs between 2019 and 2025. These vessels' crude oil production capacities are expected to total 2.5 MMbopd during that period. Accompanying this uptick in production, we expect to see a 20% increase in Brazilian drilling. State-owned Petrobras operates most of the current development.

Venezuela. Despite claiming the world's largest proved oil reserves, Venezuela's production continues a rapid descent, slumping to a 75-year low last year at 792,000 bopd. U.S. sanctions crippled the economy and cut off access to U.S. refiners. According to Baker Hughes, the average number of active rigs fell from 78.7 in 2013 to just 24.5 during 2019. Given the current governmental situation in Caracas, Venezuela's E&P sector is not likely to see any relief in the near future.

Argentina. With the world's fourth-largest reserves of shale oil and second-largest reserves of shale gas, Argentina's oil production has stabilized at 500,000 bpd or above, with 2019's gas output at 4.8 Bcfd. Drilling should remain almost steady.

Guyana has become South America's exploration success leader, producing the highest number of discoveries of any South American country during third-quarter 2019. Not only has ExxonMobil reported 16 discoveries on the Stabroek Block, to date, but two recent discoveries by Tullow Oil in the neighboring Orinduik Block have opened an entirely new Upper Tertiary oil play.

Significant interest continues in exploring the UK and Norwegian continental shelves. New production from large projects offshore Norway and the UK demonstrates continued long-term opportunities. Supermajor operators continue to divest legacy assets to regional specialists. Offshore drilling should grow 3.6%. Activity, overall, will be up slightly.

Norway. Norwegian oil production received a boost, when Johan Sverdrup field went onstream in October. Production should reach 440,000 bopd by this summer, generating a 33% increase in Norway's production during first-half 2020. Equinor expects Johan Sverdrup to deliver more than $100 billion in revenue over the next 50 years.

Operator interest in the Norwegian Continental Shelf remains strong, with the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate awarding 69 new production licenses to 26 companies in January 2020. World Oil projects a 0.9% increase in Norwegian wells drilled during 2020.

United Kingdom. The 32nd and largest offshore licensing round for the UK Continental Shelf concluded in December, attracting 104 applications that covered 245 blocks and partial blocks. Licenses should be let during second-quarter 2020. Elsewhere on the shelf, Equinor started production at Mariner field, which should produce more than 300 MMboe over 30 years. On land, drillers were dealt a significant blow at the end of 2019, when the Conservative UK government effectively banned hydraulic fracturing in new wells. We anticipate British wells drilled, both offshore and onshore, will remain even with 2019's levels.

Development of gas export pipelines, and the production to fill them, remains a key interest for operators in Russia and beyond. Wells drilled in Eastern Europe and the FSU, combined, are projected to increase 1.8% during 2020. The U.S. economic sanctions against Russia are bringing offshore drilling to a virtual standstill in that country.

Russia continues to focus on projects in its far eastern region as a means to becoming a dominant player in global gas and LNG markets. Rosneft and Novatek PJSC, the country's largest LNG producer, approved projects with an export capacity of 26 MM tons of LNG per year, doubling existing capacity. Additionally, Gazprom completed 176 gas production wells at its Chayandinskoye field in Yakutia, to fill its Power of Siberia gas pipeline servicing Chinese markets. We expect a 1.5% increase in wells drilled.

Other Eastern European and FSU countries. Exploration is picking up in the Balkans, with Bosnia-Herzegovina offering its first-ever exploration licensing round. The country joins Croatia, which offered acreage in 2019. Meanwhile, in Azerbaijan, drilling should be up 13% this year, with increases expected both onshore and offshore. Kazakhstan will be up modestly, anchored by additional development drilling at Tengiz field. The FSU countries, other than Russia, will be up 3.9% this year.

After bottoming out in 2017, African drilling has been building back. We predict a further 1.5% gain to 1,124 wells during 2020. Offshore, Africa's drilling should up 8.8%, to nearly 300 wells.

Egypt's E&P market is doing well. According to one report, Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. had the highest number of oil and gas finds globally during third-quarter 2019, three of which were in the Western Desert basin. Given these recent successes and other ongoing projects, World Oil anticipates a nearly 4% drilling increase.

Nigeria's offshore sector is building momentum, with four FPSOs planned for deployment by 2025. Nigeria has been working to boost oil output, as well as keep up with rising natural gas demand. As of December 2019, plans for a $10-billion expansion of Nigeria LNG, Africa's largest natural gas plant, were moving forward. World Oil anticipates a 5.8% increase in drilling activity for 2020.

Angola. Behind Brazil, Angola expects to deploy the second-highest number of FPSOs by 2025. Five vessels are planned during that period, which should boost oil production after several years of decline. Following a recent licensing round for 10 frontier offshore blocks, Angola may increase drilling nearly 3.0%.

Libya. Between civil war and export blockages, Libya's E&P activity has decreased dramatically. Since an eastern military commander halted exports at ports under his control, the OPEC nation's output has dropped approximately 800,000 bopd from 1.174 MMbopd. If export blockages finally cease, then drilling activity should rise modestly.

The Middle East continues to be a stellar E&P performer. Thanks to the steady development programs of various NOCs, regional drilling has remained at an historically high rate for several years. For 2020, Middle Eastern drilling should increase 3.3%. Offshore drilling will be up 8.1%, Fig. 2.

Saudi Arabia remains the global oil exports leader. A September 2019 attack on Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field, however, resulted in the largest daily spike in global oil prices in the last decade. Nevertheless, the company reportedly restored the field's production to full capacity by the end of the month. The country's heavy development work and associated drilling continue, although drilling will be down 6.0%.

Iraq. Despite tensions with Washington of late, Iraq remains the Middle East's second-largest oil producer. In spite of political tumult and requisite OPEC cuts, Iraq expected to see a 15.8% drilling increase this year.

UAE-Abu Dhabi. Government-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) recently reported a 7% surge in oil reserves, increasing to 105 Bbbl. Presently, the company produces approximately 2.9 MMbpd. ADNOC also claims to have increased its gas reserves to about 273 Tcf, amid discovery of unconventional gas deposits. Additionally, ADNOC Drilling announced a major rig fleet expansion program in November that will add dozens of rigs by 2025.

Oman, the largest Middle Eastern driller, is home to a significant new exploration opportunity after BP and Eni signed an E&P agreement for Block 77 in July 2019. Block 77 is situated east of BP's Block 61, where the Khazzan and Ghazeer gas projects are found. Meanwhile, an 8.0% increase in drilling is anticipated.

The Far East is expected to post a 1.2% gain in wells. However, if China is filtered out, then the region will barely post an increase, at 0.7%.

China. As the world's biggest oil importer, China could see a significant dip in demand growth this year. State firm CNPC said demand could slip by as much as half of last year's level, amid the ongoing trade dispute and Coronavirus epidemic. The country's oil demand should still grow, at perhaps 2.4%, CNPC told Bloomberg, but there is no way to be sure. For now, Chinese drilling should grow at about 1.2%.

Indonesia. State firm PT Pertamina, however, has taken recent steps to reduce oil imports. In November, an overhaul of the company's management team was ordered by Indonesian President Joko Widodo. He also announced that steps would be taken to process more resources domestically to boost export revenue. This year, we expect a 3.3% drilling increase.

Australia has been one of the world's leading LNG producers. According to the U.S. EIA and Australia's Department of Industry, Innovation, and Science, Australia is on track to surpass Qatar as lead producer. And operators continue to look for more oil, too, so drilling is expected to increase 1.2% during 2020.

Papua New Guinea's Papua LNG plant was anticipated for development in conjunction with Exxon-operated PNG LNG, through an expansion of the existing plant in Caution Bay. However, the government walked away from negotiations on the $10-billion project in January, putting the project on hold. Nevertheless, PNG drilling will be up slightly.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['United States', 'Norway', 'Mexico', 'United Kingdom', 'Canada', 'Venezuela', 'Brazil', 'Argentina', 'Orinduik', 'Caracas', 'Stabroek', 'Russia', 'Qatar', 'Guyana']",Special Focus: 2020 Forecast - International Drilling and Production,https://www.worldoil.com/magazine/2020/february-2020/special-focus/special-focus-2020-forecast-international-drilling-and-production,None,
11402926,2020-02-13,"LONDON (Bloomberg) - Global oil demand will drop this quarter for the first time in over a decade as the coronavirus batters China's economy, the International Energy Agency said.

The new estimates show that oil markets face a significant surplus despite the latest production cuts by OPEC and its partners. Crude already sank to a one-year low below $50 a barrel last week and the impact of the epidemic will be felt throughout the year, the agency said.

""Demand has been hit hard by the novel coronavirus and the widespread shutdown of China's economy,"" the Paris-based IEA said. ""The crisis is ongoing and at this stage it is hard to be precise about the impact.""

World fuel consumption -- which had previously been expected to grow by 800,000 barrels a day during the three-month period, compared with a year earlier -- will instead contract by 435,000 a day, the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.

For 2020 as a whole, the virus will curb annual growth in global consumption by about 30% to 825,000 barrels a day, the lowest since 2011. The effects will be more significant than those of the 2003 SARS epidemic because of China's increased importance and integration within the world economy.

The outbreak has shuttered businesses and prompted the quarantine of tens of millions of people in China, the world's biggest crude importer. The country accounted for about 75% of last year's oil-demand growth, according to the IEA, which advises most major economies.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration also cut its demand outlook due to the virus. The EIA lowered its first quarter global petroleum and liquids consumption forecast by 880,000 barrels a day.

U.S. crude futures have fallen 17% this year as traders assessed the impact of the epidemic. Consumers are unlikely to benefit from the drop in fuel prices because the disease will inflict damage on the wider economy, the IEA said.

The outbreak has prompted Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, to push its allies in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and beyond to consider an emergency meeting and further production cuts. However, Russia, the kingdom's most important partner in managing supplies, has so far resisted the initiative.

Even though the group launched new supply curbs at the start of this year, the slump in demand threatens markets with a surplus of about 1.7 million barrels a day during the first quarter and 560,000 in the second. Last month, OPEC was already pumping the least crude since the financial crisis of 2009, according to the IEA.

The OPEC+ alliance had already faced an oversupply in the first half of 2020 because of the ongoing output surge from U.S. shale-oil drillers, the agency said. That industry is likely to remain resilient against the price slump until later in the year, it predicted.

Given the abundance of supply, disruptions in OPEC members such as Libya and Nigeria are having little impact on prices, the agency said.",World Oil Online,energy,,"['China', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Nigeria', 'Libya']",Global oil demand will drop for the first time in a decade,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/2/13/global-oil-demand-will-drop-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade,None,
11402927,2020-02-11,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) - Libyan economic experts will study the distribution of crucial oil revenue as efforts continue to solve the war-ravaged OPEC member's political crisis, the United Nations said.

The decision to assign the economic commission to work ""on issues of immediate concern,"" which also include a banking crisis, came after meetings in Cairo this week attended by representatives from across Libya's political spectrum as well as economists and other academic experts. The experts agreed to meet again in early March, the UN mission in Libya said Tuesday in a statement.

The oil market had been closely monitoring the talks for any sign of a deal to restore output in the North African nation after supporters of eastern commander Khalifa Haftar forced ports to close mid-January, driving daily output down to about 180,000 barrels, its lowest since the 2011 uprising against long-time leader Moammar Qaddafi.

Imminent large-scale resumption, although unlikely, could add over 1 million barrels per day to the international market, complicating OPEC's efforts to assess the impact of the coronavirus on demand.

11402928,2020-02-10,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) - Libya's battered economy took center stage at United Nations-backed talks on ending the conflict, as a blockade that slashed the OPEC nation's vital oil output entered a fourth week.

The two-day meeting in Cairo is being closely monitored for any sign of a deal to restore output in the North African nation after supporters of eastern commander Khalifa Haftar forced ports to close mid-January, driving production to its lowest since 2011. Imminent large-scale resumption, although unlikely, could add over 1 million barrels per day to the international market, complicating OPEC's efforts to assess the impact of the coronavirus on demand.

Distribution of oil revenue has been at the heart of the turmoil that's divided the country, and an immediate breakthrough in Cairo isn't expected. The OPEC+ alliance, which controls about half of the world's oil, last week recommended cutting 600,000 barrels of combined production -- a reduction that would be dwarfed by a significant rise of Libyan output.

The talks that started Sunday are the latest in a series of global efforts to end the conflict between the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and Haftar, whose Libyan National Army controls the country's oil-rich east and south and in April turned its sights to the capital.

That offensive, which has morphed into a proxy war between regional powers, has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced tens of thousands. Both sides have accused the other of breaching a provisional cease-fire agreed in January.

Oil production in Libya, home to Africa's largest-proven reserves, has tumbled to about 180,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since the 2011 uprising against long-time leader Moammar Qaddafi, from a daily 1.2 million barrels just before the blockade. The state-run National Oil Corp. has declared force majeure on supplies.

Libya has endured major disruptions to its oil exports in recent years as battles and blockades by rival militias have repeatedly hindered efforts to revive production. A deteriorating economy has stoked anger in historically marginalized eastern Libya, where many believe too much wealth is concentrated in the west of the country.

UN Special Representative Ghassan Salame said last week he'd asked eastern Libyan tribal leaders behind the closing of the ports to specify their demands before oil revenue was discussed in Cairo. They have been disputing the ""unfair distribution of oil,"" he said in Geneva on Thursday.

While the coalition's technical experts have recommended a production cutback as Asia's coronavirus batters demand, Azerbaijan's Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov told the RIA Novosti newswire that the group is unlikely to hold an early meeting. Saudi Arabia is pushing for action, yet key partner Russia has so far resisted.

As the alliance dithers, conditions in global crude markets are deteriorating.

A discount on prompt crude, which appeared in Brent front-month contracts last week for the first time in a year, is taking hold in the futures market. The pattern, which is known as contango and usually indicates oversupply, now extends all the way through to September contracts.

Oil short-selling has more than doubled in just two weeks. Hedge funds boosted bearish wagers against WTI crude by 41% in the week ended Feb. 4, following a 52% surge a week earlier.

Another indicator closely watched by traders -- the so-called ""red spread"" between December contracts in consecutive years -- is also shifting towards contango after collapsing from $1.31 a barrel in late January to just 4 cents on Monday.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have shown some readiness to intervene, with a committee of technical experts counseling last week that the coalition -- which pumps about half the world's oil -- should deepen existing production curbs by an additional 600,000 barrels a day during the second quarter.

Yet Russia, the biggest crude producer within the group, hasn't yet announced whether it will back the policy, or a meeting before the group's scheduled early March gathering to make it happen.

""The oil price will have to do the job of balancing the market because OPEC+ will not step in and counter the current demand shock from China,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, Oslo-based chief commodities analyst at SEB AB.

West Texas Intermediate crude for March declined 0.6% to $50.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 10:46 a.m. in London. It closed 1.2% lower on Friday.

Brent for April delivery fell 057% to $54.18 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange after losing 0.8% Friday. The global crude benchmark traded at a $3.91 premium to WTI for the same month.

Chinese refiners are processing 15% less crude than before the coronavirus outbreak, said people with knowledge of operations at the nation's largest complexes. In Europe, French industrial production missed estimates, compounding a reduced demand outlook. Traders were also watching a meeting in Cairo over the weekend for signs of progress between warring factions in Libya, where oil exports are currently blockaded.

With majors including Total and BP projecting a significant hit to global oil demand this year due to the virus, the market's structure has nosedived into a bearish contango. That weakness deepened further from it's softest settlement in 13 months on Friday as Russia gave a much lower estimate for the demand hit, as it weighs an OPEC+ plan to cut output by 600,000 bopd.

""At the moment the sentiment is undoubtedly bearish, but you have to wait until next week for the Russian approval or disapproval,"" said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga.

Brent fell $0.66, or 1.2%, to $54.27/bbl on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract is down almost 7% this week, set for the longest streak of weekly drops since November 2018. West Texas Intermediate fell 1.4% to $50.26.

Both state-owned and private refineries in China have scaled back processing by at least 2 MMbopd over the past week, said people with knowledge of operations at the nation's largest complexes. So-called throughput could fall further as demand for aviation and transportation fuels continues to shrink as entire cities remain locked down and travel is restricted, the people said.

11402931,2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg) - European Union diplomats agreed to impose travel bans on two Turkish nationals and freeze their assets in retaliation for Ankara's gas prospecting in disputed waters near Cyprus, two officials familiar with the matter said.

The decision to target the two individuals was reached at a meeting of EU diplomats in Brussels Tuesday, the people said, asking not to be named, pending the legal paperwork and a formal sign off by ministers later this month. While the punitive measures won't affect Turkish companies in the hydrocarbon sector, they mark an extraordinary escalation against a country which is still officially a candidate for EU membership.

Turkey is at loggerheads with EU member Cyprus over potentially lucrative gas reserves in the southeastern Mediterranean and has been sending drilling ships to explore the area. Cyprus says the waters are part of its exclusive economic zone, while Ankara says it is protecting the claims of Turkish-Cypriots in the northern part of the divided island.

Even though the EU has squarely backed Cyprus, the bloc is wary of jeopardizing an agreement under which Turkey helped resolve the 2016 refugee crisis in exchange for financial assistance. Despite pressure from Cyprus, negotiations for targeted measures against Turkish individuals have been dragging for months and other EU governments have so far resisted more aggressive Cypriot proposals that would target Turkish companies involved in the sector.

Still, the spat adds to a series of disputes -- from sliding democratic standards to Turkish interventions in Syria and Libya -- which have pushed relations between Ankara and the EU to breaking point. The bloc has already suspended Turkish accession negotiations, and most member states imposed an arms embargo over Ankara's military operations in Syria.

Turkey is also set for a clash with Greece over a separate maritime accord with Libya, which Athens says is illegal. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said he ""will do whatever it takes"" to protect the country's sovereignty if Turkey begins drilling in waters Greece claims as its own.

11402932,2020-01-29,"LONDON (Bloomberg) - Tankers have begun to leave Libyan ports without cargoes after waiting for days for the end of a blockade of the country's export terminals by forces loyal to Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar.

The blockade has virtually halted crude exports from the North African country, which had been running at about 1 million barrels a days in recent months. More than half of those shipments went to buyers in the Mediterranean, with Italy, Spain and France among the biggest buyers. China has also emerged as a significant market for Libyan crude, with about a fifth of export volumes heading to the world's biggest oil importer.

Haftar's forces closed export ports in the Gulf of Sirte in Central Libya and the Hariga terminal in the east of country on Jan. 17. The Mellitah and Zawiya terminals in the west of the country were forced to halt shipments two days later, after flows from the fields that supply them were also stopped. As a result of the port closures, the National Oil Corp. declared force majeure on supplies, which can allow Libya -- home to Africa's largest-proven oil reserves -- to legally suspend delivery contracts.

At least four tankers, capable of hauling more than three million barrels of crude, have left Libyan ports in the last 24 hours without taking on cargoes, according to tanker tracking data monitored by Bloomberg. More are preparing to leave, according to port agent reports.

The country has almost no storage capacity that could allow onshore fields to continue pumping even though exports are curtailed. Several storage tanks at the Ras Lanuf terminal were destroyed in 2018, reducing the number of operational tanks to three from 13. Only Libya's two offshore projects -- Bouri and Al Jurf -- are still able to operate normally; they typically each pump about 30,000 barrels a day.

Libyan oil production had fallen to 271,204 barrels a day, the NOC said yesterday in a statement on its Facebook page. The company's Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Bloomberg Television on Monday that output could fall as low as 72,000 barrels within days if the situation doesn't improve.

""It is not exactly clear what Haftar seeks in return for an end to the blockade,"" Tim Eaton, senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London, said by email.

The country is currently pumping 262,000 bpd and could fall as low as 72,000 bpd within days, National Oil Corp. Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Bloomberg Television in an interview. ""The loss of Libyan oil production will have a bad effect on the price.""

Eastern-based general Khalifa Haftar, the military leader whose Libyan National Army controls the oil-rich east and south of the country, in April launched an offensive to take the capital Tripoli, which has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced tens of thousands, just as the United Nations was laying the ground for a political conference to unite the country.

The crisis escalated earlier this month, crippling oil production, closing export terminals and forcing the NOC to declare force majeure on supplies, which can allow Libya -- home to Africa's largest-proven oil reserves -- to legally suspend delivery contracts.

The closure of oil ports resulted in losses totaling $318 million, the NOC has said and cutting the nation's production from 1.2 million bpd before the halt. That was the highest level in six years but still well below its output before the civil war that overthrew dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The country has no storage capacity currently, Sanalla said.

Libya has since been divided into rival camps in Tripoli and the east, each with its own set of governing institutions. The country has endured major disruptions to its output and exports as battles and blockades among rival armed groups and militias hindered efforts to revive production.

As a result of the blockade the NOC has been told it won't receive the budget it requested for an ""ambitious program to expand oil production,"" Sanalla said in a statement Monday.

""Acting illegally by blocking Libyan oil production will just lead to the further impoverishment of the Libyan state and erosion of the rule of law,"" he said. Discussions are taking place on lifting the blockade, he added in the interview.

11402934,2020-01-27,"HOUSTON (Bloomberg) - An election held in the U.S. in 2020 could do a lot to shape global climate outcomes in the immediate future. It won't feature Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, and the winner won't live in the White House. It's a race for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, which holds immense power over the state's vast oil and gas industry.

Booming oil and gas production across the Permian Basin of West Texas has made this little-known regulator, with three voting members, a pivotal decision-maker for the American contribution to climate change. The reason for this comes down to natural-gas flaring. Drillers in Texas, as in other places, are allowed to burn off vast amounts of natural gas that is a by-product of oil production. This is done, in part, because of the expense involved in capturing the gas, putting it into pipelines, and moving it to processing facilities.

And it happens with permission from the Texas Railroad Commission.

Burning off the gas prevents the unchecked release of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas that causes as much as 36 times more warming than carbon dioxide in the 100-year period after its release, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But allowing Texas drillers to burn their unwanted gas -- something the Railroad Commission almost always does -- is a harmful solution: Tons of carbon dioxide and other pollutants enter the atmosphere, without yielding any useful energy.

Global gas flaring emits more than 350 million tons of CO2-equivalent each year, according to the World Bank. That's equal to all the natural gas consumed in Central America and South America each year.

""This is the most important environmental race in the country,"" says Chrysta Castañeda, 56, one of four Democratic candidates vying to become the first non-Republican commissioner in more than 25 years and the first Democrat to win statewide office since the 1990s. The commission ""is not enforcing the laws"" on flaring. ""What's going on in Texas is one of the biggest contributors to the issue worldwide.""

Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton said it's ""patently false"" that the agency is not enforcing the rules on flaring. The state flares just 2% of its gas production, much less than most other major producing countries, according to a statement released by his office.

The Railroad Commission was set up by the state in the late 1800s to regulate private railroads. Over the years, that mandate grew to include everything from oil and gas in 1919 to buses and trucks in 1931. A few regulatory changes left the agency no longer overseeing transportation, but the name has stuck and it remains the chief regulator of the state's oil and gas industry.

The commission has never denied a flaring permit for other than administrative reasons. In one recent case, a company won permission to burn unwanted gas by arguing that connecting to a nearby pipeline would be too expensive. If the Permian Basin were a country, it would have ranked ninth for total volume of flared gas in 2018, ahead of Mexico and Angola and just behind Libya.

""It's not an easy, black-and-white, 'Well-why-don't-you-just-tell-them-to-stop?' kind of problem,"" says Bobby Tudor, co-founder of Houston-based investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., which advises oil and gas companies. ""But I think in general, a much firmer stand from the Railroad Commission and leadership from the most active companies can make a difference.""

Flaring is central to the campaign to unseat Sitton, and the issue is gaining more attention than ever. The race now includes Castañeda and three additional Democratic challengers: Dallas lawyers Roberto Alonzo and Mark Watson and San Marcos educator Kelly Stone. Watson and Stone both say they, too, want to crack down on flaring. Alonzo didn't respond to requests for comment and does not appear to have a website.

""The prices paid for shale oil do not accurately reflect the true cost of production,"" Watson says. ""Flaring natural gas must be reduced very quickly, in a responsible manner.""

Stone takes it a step farther, siding with Democratic presidential candidates such as Warren and Sanders, who have come out in support of a ban on fracking.

""I'm a gal that wants to ban fracking,"" says Stone, who taught at Texas State University until her class, Sexuality Across the Life Span, was canceled last year amid a spat with national conservative group Turning Point USA. ""I realize that I'm saying that in the state of Texas, where people clutch their pearls when you say something like that."" (A spokesman for the university said it doesn't comment on personnel matters, and Turning Point USA didn't respond to a request for comment.)

Castañeda says such a move would risk ""huge disruption to our current economy and current lifestyle."" She accuses the Republican-dominated commission of failing to enforce the commission's existing rules by putting limits on waste.

""If we are going to extract fossil fuels from the ground, we ought to use them productively and not wastefully,"" says Castañeda.

Sitton frames the issue around preventing the economic waste of leaving oil in the ground. Halting flaring would ""cost billions in terms of economic impacts and taxes to the state and Federal government"" as well as raising energy costs, his office said in its statement. ""The energy produced in Texas provides affordable energy for people all around the world and it is produced more cleanly and responsibly than anywhere else in the world.""

Last December, Sitton told Bloomberg Television that he's ""very confident"" about his chances for reelection.

In Texas, producers are allowed to flare without limits in the first 10 days a well is operational; after that, flaring requires a permit from the Railroad Commission. In 2019, the commission granted 6,972 permits allowing companies to flare or vent natural gas, a 40-fold increase from the start of the shale boom a decade ago. Texas crude output, meanwhile, increased fivefold over that period.

Not surprisingly, flaring in the Permian Basin, which stretches across West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, has climbed to an all-time high. The basin flared 700 million cubic feet of gas each day in the third quarter of 2019, according to Oslo-based Rystad Energy. That would be more than enough to meet residential demand across the entire state of Texas.

Producers say they need to flare because natural gas pipelines haven't kept pace with supplies. Local gas prices are so depressed that at times they've gone negative, meaning drillers have to pay to get someone to haul away unwanted fuel. That's been enough to convince current Railroad Commissioners that flaring is warranted.

""The industry and the Railroad Commission has been saying, 'We need more pipeline capacity,'"" says Colin Leyden, senior manager of regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund in Texas. ""They've been saying that for six years. I think that pipeline capacity is going to end up helping, but it's not going to solve the issue.""

Castañeda believes there are other options. She points to on-site power generation, in which producers run natural gas through a generator, turning it into electricity that can power their own operations. Oil companies could also connect to the grid, using gas to power homes and businesses across the state. ""They could put excess power into the grid so that in hot summer days, we are not pulling coal-fired power plants back online to make up that gap,"" she says.

Like Sitton, who worked as an engineer for several oil companies, Castañeda touts her experience in the industry, including a high-profile case in which she represented T. Boone Pickens's Mesa Petroleum in a lawsuit against J. Cleo Thompson, another legendary Texas wildcatter, over assets in one of the hottest parts of the Permian Basin.

Castañeda and her Democratic challengers are trying to ride a blue wave in a state that's still mostly red. Plus, there's the challenge of getting voters to understand what exactly the Texas Railroad Commission does in time for the November election. And not all oil producers are likely to be excited about the idea of greater regulation of their activities.

Castañeda has been making the rounds across the state, including the unofficial capital of the Permian Basin: Midland. She turned up for a recent event at the Midland Petroleum Club and got into a conversation with a small-scale local operator. ""I just introduced myself as a Democrat running for the Railroad Commission,"" she says, ""and one of the first questions I got was, 'What are you going to do about this flaring problem?'""

There were moments last year when it seemed that the Texas Railroad Commission was changing its permissive posture on flaring permits. In a rare split, Chairman Wayne Christian, whose seat is up for reelection in 2022, dissented from the decision to grant Exco Resources a permit, despite the fact that it could connect to a Williams Cos. pipeline nearby. Williams is now suing the commission.

""In my business, I have to pay for the local sewage, the local garbage,"" Christian said at a second meeting, in which he raised concern over issuing a permit to Exco. ""It's a cost of doing business.""

Still, that was just one case in almost 7,000 from 2019. Christian and the other two Republican commissioners have otherwise voted staunchly in favor to allow producers to flare. Castañeda or any other flaring opponent successful in taking the seat would likely be outvoted.

When asked how she would deal with that, Castañeda responds: ""There's always the bully pulpit.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Texas', 'Houston', 'United States', 'San Marcos, Texas', 'Dallas', 'Mexico', 'Libya', 'Angola', 'Midland, Texas', 'New Mexico', 'Mesa, Arizona']",This year's other big climate election is for a Texas railroad bureaucrat,https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/1/27/this-year-s-other-big-climate-election-is-for-a-texas-railroad-bureaucrat,None,
11402935,2020-01-26,"LONDON (Bloomberg) - Libya's Central Bank Governor Sadiq Al-Kabir called on the international community to help end a week-long shutdown of oil ports by eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, likening the closures to a ""bullet in the head.""

It is too early to assess the damage from the blockade that's halted crude exports from the OPEC country and forced the National Oil Corp. to declare a force majeure on supplies, Kabir said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. The shutdown comes after a year of economic growth and reforms in the war-torn country, which sits atop Africa's largest oil reserves, he said.

Haftar, the military leader who controls critical parts of the country, crippled oil production and closed ports last weekend while haggling over a truce with the national government. The closure of oil ports resulted in output declining to 320,000 barrels a day from 1.2 million, and in losses totaling $256 million as of Jan. 18, Jazeera reported Saturday, citing the country's oil national corporation.

One of Haftar's main demands has been the removal of Kabir and a fairer distribution of oil revenues to support the historically marginalized eastern part of the country.

Kabir denied there is spending disparity. ""The fair distribution is there,"" he said, adding that the bank issues regular reports on its finances. Oil accounted for 93% of state revenues and 70% of spending, with a large portion going to public salaries, he said.

Kabir said he would be willing to step down if legal conditions in a 2015 United Nations political deal were met. The country has two rival governments, each controlling a parallel central bank and national oil company.

11402936,2020-01-22,"SINGAPORE (Bloomberg) - Oil declined on concerns that a coronavirus outbreak in Asia could spread and curtail demand in a market that's already contending with plentiful supplies.

Futures slipped 0.8% to trade near $58 a barrel in New York. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said prices could slip about $3 a barrel if an outbreak plays out in the same way as the SARS epidemic in 2003. Prices have so far shown only a limited response to the halt of exports from OPEC member Libya, as U.S. inventories are forecast to expand from already-comfortable levels.

""After the demand optimism we saw regained at the end of last year, we believe that much more aggressive demand worries are about to enter the market, at least in the short term,"" said Helge Andre Martinsen, senior oil market analyst at DNB Bank ASA.

Oil prices are slightly lower compared with the end of last year as crises threatening supplies in OPEC nations Libya, Iran and Iraq -- as well as the signing of a preliminary trade deal between the U.S. and China -- fail to provide lasting support. With the U.S. shale oil boom continuing, and being supplemented by offshore projects from the North Sea to Guyana, the world is ""awash with oil,"" according to the International Energy Agency.

West Texas Intermediate futures fell 45 cents to $57.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 10:45 a.m. London time. Brent for March settlement lost 44 cents to $64.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.

Oil demand may be curbed by 260,000 barrels a day on average if the outbreak spreads, Goldman said in a note, referencing the SARS impact in 2003 and translating that into a 2020 scenario. The peak travel season around Chinese New Year -- which officially begins on Jan. 25 -- ""is a tremendous challenge, which could complicate the disease diffusion,"" according to UBS Group AG.

Economists warned that China's fragile economic stabilization could be at risk if authorities fail to contain the new virus sweeping across Asia.

Brent crude slipped as much as 1.4% in London, approaching $64 a barrel. Libyan ports have been closed on the order of militia leader Khalifa Haftar while he haggles over a peace settlement with the national government. Yet crude markets remain calm because ""the world is awash with oil, mainly coming from the United States,"" International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a Bloomberg TV interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Prices also weakened in tandem with European stocks dropping, alongside U.S. equity futures on Tuesday, tracking broad declines across Asia amid a series of negative developments in Hong Kong and worries about a deadly virus in China.

Brent crude dropped 86 cents, or 1.3%, to $64.34 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 10:13 a.m. in London. West Texas Intermediate futures for February lost 59 cents to $57.95 from Friday's close. There was no settlement Monday due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

Haftar has blocked ports under his control in a show of defiance after world leaders failed to persuade him to sign a peace deal ending the country's civil war. In Iraq, protests have halted a minor field and rockets reportedly hit the Green Zone in Baghdad after a weekend of unrest.

It's the third time in four months that a supply crisis in OPEC nations has been largely shrugged off. Brent soared to almost $72 a barrel two weeks ago as hostilities between the U.S. and Iran erupted in neighboring Iraq over the assassination of an Iranian general, endangering regional energy exports, yet prices soon eased off as a wider conflict was averted.

Haftar stopped the production at virtually all of the nation's oil fields on the eve of an international peace conference in Berlin on Sunday. Global oil prices jumped above $65 a barrel on Monday as the Libyan disruptions coincided with the shutdown of some oil output in Iraq, reigniting fears about the market's vulnerability to geopolitical risk in key supply regions.

11402939,2020-01-20,"BRUSSELS (Bloomberg) - The European Union's foreign policy chief said member states will need to take a more active role in Libya if yesterday's peace conference in Berlin is to bring stability to the country and help get its oil flowing again.

Speaking before a meeting of foreign ministers Monday, Josep Borrell said the EU has to decide how it will ensure Libya's tentative cease-fire holds in order to capitalize on the limited progress achieved in Berlin. Libya's oil output plunged to the lowest level since 2011 this week after eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar began a blockade of several ports.

""A cease-fire requires someone to take care of it. We cannot say this is a cease-fire and then forget about it,"" Borrell said as he arrived at the meeting in Brussels. ""Arms control, embargo control -- there are several possibilities and the ministers will have to decide what to do in order to help implement the agreements of yesterday's conference.""

World leaders meeting in Berlin on Sunday agreed to work toward a more durable cease-fire in the North African nation. Yet, the talks also showed how global powers are struggling to find solutions to a conflict that's raged for years. Haftar has led a months-long assault on Tripoli, and fighting continued outside the capital over the weekend.

Global oil prices jumped above $65 a barrel on Monday as the Libyan disruptions coincided with the shutdown of some oil output in Iraq, reigniting fears about the market's vulnerability to geopolitical risk in key supply regions.

After Haftar blocked exports from ports under his control, the state-run National Oil Corp declared force majeure on Saturday, allowing Libya -- home to Africa's largest-proven oil reserves -- to legally suspend delivery contracts. Libya won't be able to pump more than 72,000 barrels per day once its storage tanks are full, according to a spokesman for the NOC, down from more than 1.2 million barrels per day on Saturday.

European leaders are trying to regain a foothold in Libya after they were sidelined by Russia and Turkey's support for opposing sides in the conflict. The foreign ministers want to find a way to protect a UN-mandated arms embargo on Libya, after the participants in Berlin vowed to respect it. The EU already has a mandate to monitor the embargo, but it lacks any warships and its efforts have been hamstrung by disputes with Italy about where to disembark migrants saved at sea.

""The Berlin conference achieved only a truce, not a real cease-fire. And there are no clear mechanisms to sanction whoever violates the truce, or the arms embargo,"" said Dario Cristiani, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. ""Which means: there is no real way to stop external interference.""

Highlighting the complexity of the EU's objective to find a way forward, the Greek government has said it will not accept any political deal for Libya that doesn't annul an agreement the Libyan government struck with Turkey on maritime borders. EU foreign policy decisions require unanimity.

EU officials are concerned that unless they have a say in the Libyan peace process the bloc could be vulnerable to waves of immigrants flowing across the country's fragile borders. Libya has been a gateway for migrants seeking refuge in Europe and the EU is also concerned that the chaos in the country is proving fertile ground for Islamic extremists who have targeted Europeans in the past.

Under the terms of Sunday's agreement, Haftar, who is backed by Russia, and Libya's internationally recognized Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj will now each put forward five names for a committee to hash out the terms of a more permanent halt to fighting.

The Sharara field, which can pump 300,000 barrels a day, will stop producing once its storage tanks are full, a person familiar with the situation said. Libya's oil production has already plummeted to the lowest level since September 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Libya's output has plunged by about 800,000 barrels a day from 1.174 million since an eastern military commander, Khalifa Haftar, blocked exports at ports under his control, according to a statement on Saturday from the state-run National Oil Corp. The NOC declared force majeure, which can allow Libya -- home to Africa's largest-proven oil reserves -- to legally suspend delivery contracts.

Members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard under the command of Haftar's Libyan National Army shut down the Hamada-Zawiya oil pipeline, forcing the NOC to limit oil production at the Sharara and El Feel fields, according to an NOC statement. The Hamada station hosts pipelines for Mellitah Oil Co. and Akakus, the operators at El Feel and Sharara respectively, it said.

""This is a policy-related disruption,"" said Edward Bell, director of commodity research at Dubai-based bank Emirates NBD PJSC. ""There could be a pretty quick turnaround if there's a political solution.""

Crude prices will probably jump in trading on Monday but not by as much as they did after the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, Bell said. Libya has less production at stake than Saudi Arabia, and its difficulties are more contained than the Saudi crisis, which threatened to escalate into a regional war, he said. Brent crude rose 23 cents on Friday to end the week at $64.85 a barrel.

Haftar's show of force comes as he prepares to attend an international conference in Berlin on Sunday hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel where the general will face pressure to agree to a cease-fire. Haftar, whose troops have been bogged down in the southern suburbs of the capital of Tripoli, has so far refused efforts to end his offensive and agree to a compromise.

By shutting down oil fields, Haftar is denying a key source of revenue to the internationally recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Funds from oil production go to the country's central bank, and the Tripoli government has them money to buy weapons for its defense.

Russian mercenaries have supported Haftar's forces, according to officials who told Bloomberg. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates are also backing Haftar.

11402942,2020-01-16,"ANKARA (Bloomberg) - Turkey will issue new exploration licenses in the eastern Mediterranean now that it's set a maritime border with Libya, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday, a step liable to exacerbate strains with Greece and the European Union.

Erdogan's remarks underlined Turkey's determination to press its claims in contested waters of the energy-rich eastern Mediterranean, where European nations, Egypt and Israel have built a forum to promote their interests. Turkey insists it has rights to energy finds there due to its claims to Cyprus's north, which it seized in 1974. Greece, Cyprus and the EU oppose Ankara's drilling operations within the island's exclusive economic zone.

Tensions over the conflicting claims have escalated since Turkey and Libya signed a contentious agreement in November that delineates maritime borders and affirms claims of sovereignty over areas of the Mediterranean. Turkey's demands could make it more difficult and costly to build a planned natural-gas pipeline that could link the eastern Mediterranean basin with European markets through Cyprus, Greece and Italy.

""From now on, it is not legally possible to carry out any exploration activity or construction of a pipeline in areas between Turkey and Libya without the permission of both countries,"" Erdogan told a televised conference in Ankara. ""We will issue licenses for these areas and start exploration work in 2020.""

Greece, Cyprus and Egypt see the deal with Libya as a brazen Turkish bid for dominance in the contested waters. Libya is also in conflict with Greece over off-shore exploration licenses Athens issued for waters south of Crete, which is located between Turkey and Libya.

Turkey extracted the maritime agreement from Libya's internationally recognized government in exchange for military assistance in the North African nation's civil war. Ankara and Moscow are now trying to bring the warring sides to a truce, which would also protect the accord.

The eastern Mediterranean has been one of the world's most prolific spots for major gas discoveries during the past decade. Noble Energy Inc. found the Leviathan gas field in Israeli waters in 2010 and Italy's Eni SpA discovered the giant Zohr deposit off the Egyptian coast in 2015. Exxon made a discovery off the southwest coast of Cyprus last year.

Turkish drilling ships are currently operating off Cyprus in waters declared by Turkey as its own economic exclusive zone, under agreements with the northern Turkish Cypriot state, which is recognized only by Turkey.

The U.N. chief ""hopes that this will be translated into an immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. In the chaos that followed the country was divided.

A weak U.N.-recognized administration that holds the capital of Tripoli and parts of the country's west is backed by Turkey and to a lesser degree Qatar and Italy as well as local militias. On the other side is a rival government in the east that supports self-styled Gen. Khalifa Hifter, whose forces launched an offensive to capture the capital last April and are backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt as well as France and Russia.

According to media reports, fear of the new coronavirus is widespread in Libya, with the government announcing a curfew starting Sunday night over concerns of a possible outbreak and Hifter's forces worried that foreign mercenaries fighting alongside them may have the virus.

Last month, the U.N. Security Council endorsed a 55-point road map for ending the war in Libya that 12 key leaders agreed to at a conference in Berlin on Jan. 19.

This past week, the U.N. Mission in Libya and a large number of international groups called on the opposing parties to declare an immediate humanitarian pause in hostilities and halt the transfer of military equipment and personnel into the country to enable a response to the pandemic.

Dujarric said the secretary-general welcomed the positive response from the government on March 18 and Hifter's Libyan National Army on March 21 to calls for a humanitarian pause.

""Given the already dire humanitarian situation in Libya and the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the secretary-general calls on the parties to join forces to address the threat and to ensure unhindered access of humanitarian aid throughout the country,"" the U.N. spokesman said.

8:15 p.m.

The president of Africa's most populous country, Nigeria, is calling for the ""uninhibited supply of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for all.""

African nations have been outspoken in seeking the equitable distribution of any COVID-19 vaccine, while watching anxiously as some of the world's richest countries strike deals with pharmaceutical companies to secure millions of doses of potential vaccines.

President Muhammadu Buhari warns that if the United Nations can't marshal an inclusive response to the pandemic, then it ""would have failed in its core mission of giving expression, direction and solution to the yearnings of the international community.""

The U.N.'s health agency, the World Health Organization, has said Africa should receive at least 220 million doses through an international effort to develop and distribute a vaccine known as COVAX.

But Africa's top public health official has said the continent needs at least 1.5 billion doses, enough to cover 60% of the population for ""herd immunity"" with the two likely required doses.

Argentine President Alberto Fernández is asking the world to think beyond creating a vaccine that will help end the coronavirus pandemic.

In his prerecorded speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, he challenged leaders to use the health crisis as a moment of inflection to find solutions for other scourges as well.

He says the world needs to ""be capable of dreaming and creating a vaccine against social injustice, environmental destruction and discrimination.""

The center-left president also urged leaders to treat an eventual COVID-19 vaccine as a global public good accessible equitably to all countries.

Fernández said the planet is facing an ""historic opportunity"" to unite and that international cooperation ""like we once knew how to do"" is the only path forward.

His call echoes that of other Latin American leaders pressing for more solidarity among nations that have largely faced the pandemic on their own.

Argentina ranks 10th worldwide in the total number of COVID-19 cases. Some 640,000 have been diagnosed, and nearly 13,500 have died.

As the world's leaders gather remotely this year for the U.N. General Assembly, something else looks unusual: All of the speakers on the first day are men.

As the schedule goes, it will take some 50 speakers before President Zuzana ?aputová of Slovakia gives prerecorded remarks Wednesday afternoon.

According to tradition, Brazil speaks first and the United States second at the U.N. gathering. After that, the world body says, ""the speaking order is based on the level of representation, preference and other criteria such as geographic balance.""

Just two other women are set to speak Wednesday: Bolivia's interim president, Jeanine Anez, and Simonetta Sommaruga, president of the Swiss Confederation.

Incidentally, the U.N. has never had a female secretary-general, though a spirited campaign pressed for one ahead of the selection of current U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi used his speech to the U.N. General Assembly to call for reforms at the world body, including finding new ways for countries to adhere to its resolutions and expanding the Security Council to better represent African nations.

In prerecorded remarks Tuesday, the leader of the Arab world's most populous nation also slammed the international community for continuing to ""turn a blind eye"" to countries that support terrorism. While not naming any nation specifically, he accused countries of sending foreign fighters to neighboring Libya under the aim of ""colonial illusions.""

In the past, El-Sissi has threatened military action against Turkish-backed forces in Libya. He again threatened to intervene to protect Egypt's western border, warning that any breach ""will be fiercely faced by Egypt in defense of its people.""

Libya has been plagued by chaos since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The country is split west to east with its major cities controlled by rival governments.

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has defended his drug crackdown and dismissed criticism from human rights advocates as he addressed the U.N.'s annual gathering of world leaders for the first time.

With the coronavirus taking a toll on the Philippines, the often brash Duterte struck a somewhat conciliatory tone about the organization he's often criticized and at times threatened to leave.

Duterte said in a prerecorded video Tuesday for the U.N. General Assembly that ""the Philippines values the role that the United Nations plays in its fight against the pandemic.""

He welcomed the U.N.'s launch of a relief fund and called on the international community to ensure potential vaccines are accessible to all.

He also expressed openness to ""constructive engagement"" with the U.N.

Duterte often lashes out at what he decries as international meddling in Philippine domestic affairs. Western governments and human rights groups call it justifiable alarm about an anti-drug crusade that's left over 5,700 mostly poor suspects dead.

Colombian President Iván Duque is calling on the international community to reject Venezuela's plans to hold a legislative election in December.

In a prerecorded speech for the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Duque called the vote a ""manufactured orchestra"" that ""looks to legitimize the dictatorship.""

He also highlighted a recent U.N. Human Rights Council report accusing Nicolás Maduro's government of committing crimes against humanity, including torture and killings blamed on security forces.

U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó has called on Venezuelans not to participate in the planned election to replace National Assembly lawmakers.

Maduro's government has taken over several prominent opposition parties and barred numerous anti-government leaders from running.

The socialist Venezuelan leader is expected to address the U.N. gathering Wednesday. He is calling on the U.N. to send a mission to observe the vote.

Though about 60 U.N. members back Guaidó, the majority recognize Maduro.

France's president says the coronavirus pandemic should shock nations into working together -- and resisting a world order dominated by the U.S. and China.

Speaking Tuesday to the annual U.N. General Assembly, French President Emmanuel Macron decried the United Nations' failure to vanquish the virus.

In a video recording from Paris, he said, ""No country will come out of this ordeal on its own.""

He says the pandemic should be an ""an electric shock"" to encourage more multilateral action. Otherwise the world will be ""collectively condemned to a pas de deux"" by the U.S. and China in which everyone else is ""reduced to being nothing but the sorry spectators of a collective impotence.""

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is the first world leader at the United Nations'' annual gathering to mention the Black Lives Matter movement.

""As a country that has known too well the anguish of institutional racism, South Africa supports the demands for swift actions against racism"" whether it be perpetrated by companies, states or others, he said in his pre-recorded message to the U.N. General Assembly.

South Africa last year marked a quarter-century since the end of the racist system of apartheid, and Ramaphosa worked closely with Nelson Mandela, the country's first Black president.

South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world. Like many African nations, it has not escaped the problem of police brutality.

President Donald Trump says the United Nations must hold China ""accountable"" for failing to contain the coronavirus, which has killed about 200,000 Americans and nearly 1 million around the world.

11403660,2020-02-13,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council endorsed a 55-point road map for ending the war in Libya on Wednesday and condemned the recent increase in violence in the oil-rich North African country.

The vote on the British-drafted resolution was 14-0, with Russia abstaining even though Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the 12 leaders who agreed to the plan at a conference in Berlin on Jan. 19.

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he abstained because the government has ""serious doubts"" about whether the resolution can be implemented and end the war between rival governments ""in the way we'd like to see it."" He said the Berlin plan ""has one defect ... and that is a lack of clearly expressed consent from the Libyan sides themselves.""

""Events will show us who was right,"" Nebenzia said. ""And if the resolution will have a positive impact in resolving the conflict, I will be the first to acknowledge I was wrong.""

British Ambassador Karen Pierce countered that ""the resolution is viable,"" saying all it does ""is give concrete expression to the commitments that leaders adopted at Berlin -- and that included adoption by President Putin.""

""We all want to see it implemented,"" she said. ""But it will be up to the parties on the ground and their foreign backers as to whether or not it gets implemented. So to the Russians and the others who have very close interests in Libya, I would think the remedy is in their hands.""

Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. In the chaos that followed the country was divided.

A weak U.N.-recognized administration that holds the capital of Tripoli and parts of the country's west is backed by Turkey, which recently sent thousands of soldiers to Libya, and to a lesser degree Qatar and Italy as well as local militias.

On the other side is a rival government in the east that supports self-styled Gen. Khalifa Hifter, whose forces launched an offensive to capture the capital last April and are backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt as well as France and Russia.

The Tripoli authorities and U.S. officials have accused Hifter of relying on hundreds of Russian mercenaries. Sudanese armed groups from the Darfur region recently joined the fighting on both sides, according to a report by U.N. experts.

Acting U.S. deputy ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet told the council after the vote that it's ""very unfortunate that foreign mercenaries, including from the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group, are making an inclusive political solution harder to achieve"" and making it harder for the two sides to get together.

The resolution demands that all countries refrain from interfering in Libya's conflict and its internal affairs and observe a U.N. arms embargo, ""including by ceasing all support for and withdrawing all armed mercenary personnel."" Russia sought unsuccessfully to change references to growing involvement of mercenaries in the initial draft to ""foreign terrorist fighters.""

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the Berlin agreement has been repeatedly violated by continuing arms deliveries to the warring parties and escalating fighting. He called the current offensives by rival forces ""a scandal,"" saying the commitments ""apparently were made without a true intention of respecting them.""

The resolution welcomes last week's cease-fire talks between Libya's warring sides in Geneva and calls for their continuation ""without further delay in order to agree a permanent cease-fire.""

It asks Guterres to submit his views on conditions for a cease-fire and proposals for effective monitoring of a truce, with a view to making detailed recommendations when a cease-fire is announced. The African Union, European Union and Arab League have been mentioned as possible participants in cease-fire monitoring along with the U.N.

Germany's deputy ambassador, Juergen Schulz, said the council was sending ""an important signal for peace in Libya, reaffirming the concrete commitments of all the participants of the Berlin conference.""

He welcomed the timing -- ahead of a Feb. 16 follow-up ministerial meeting of Berlin conference participants on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

""The swift implementation of the Berlin conclusions is now crucial in light of the ongoing violations of international humanitarian law and reports of mounting civilian casualties,"" Schulz said.

The resolution threatens sanctions against those supporting acts that threaten peace which Schulz said demonstrates the council's ""resolve to hold violators accountable.""

South African Ambassador Jerry Matjila, whose country chairs the African Union, stressed Libya's roots in Africa, saying the arms embargo must be observed to prevent the conflict spilling into the Sahel.

""The African Union has been very ready to play a central role, including the issue of monitoring of peace,"" he said. ""The road ahead is going to be very, very difficult, long. So it really needs all hands on deck, and you couldn't do that without African hands.""",AP,energy,,"['Berlin', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Sudan', 'Qatar', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Geneva', 'Darfur', 'Germany']",UN council endorses 55-point road map to end  war in Libya,https://apnews.com/204e9ce4abe02259d33eb8e0bf122ef5,None,
11403661,2020-02-12,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council is set to vote Wednesday on a resolution that would endorse a 55-point road map for ending the war in Libya and condemn the recent increase in violence.

The British-drafted resolution demands the warring parties ""commit to a lasting cease-fire"" and insists on full compliance with a U.N. arms embargo that has been repeatedly broken, as called for in the plan approved by leaders of 12 world powers and other key countries meeting Jan. 19 in Berlin.

It also recalls the commitment of all participants at the Berlin meeting to refrain from interfering in Libya's conflict and its internal affairs and expresses concern ""over the growing involvement of mercenaries in Libya.""

Russia and South Africa objected to an earlier text of the resolution.

Russia sought some major changes that were not accepted, including changing the welcome for the Berlin conference to ""takes note of"" the meeting and changing the expression of concern over the growing involvement of mercenaries to ""foreign terrorist fighters."" The draft does reaffirm ""the need to combat ... threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.""

It was unclear Tuesday how Russia, especially, would vote on the resolution.

The Security Council on Tuesday voted 14-0 with Russia abstaining on a resolution extending the arms embargo, travel ban, asset freeze and other sanctions on Libya and Libyans until April 30, 2021. It also extended the mandate of the U.N. panel of experts monitoring implementation of the sanctions until May 15, 2021.

The two countries raised objections to the British-drafted Security Council resolution, which backs the 55-point road map to end the war in Libya that was approved by leaders of 12 world powers and other key countries in Berlin on Jan. 19.

Belgium's U.N. ambassador, Marc Pecsteen de Buytswerve, the current council president, told reporters after brief closed council consultations on the draft resolution that ""efforts are continuing"" to reach agreement.

""My own feeling is that we are close, but there are still some efforts that are required,"" he said, adding that he urged all council members ""to show flexibility in order to get an agreement.""

The proposed resolution recalls the commitment of all participants at the Berlin meeting to support a cease-fire, refrain from interfering in Libya's conflict and its internal affairs, fully comply with a U.N. arms embargo, and withdraw all mercenaries who have been increasingly involved in the fighting.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at a news conference Tuesday that the Berlin agreement has been repeatedly violated by continuing arms deliveries to the warring parties and escalating fighting.

11403663,2020-01-02,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's parliament is voting Thursday on whether to send Turkish troops to Libya to help the U.N.-supported government in Tripoli battle forces loyal to a rival administration in eastern Libya that is seeking to capture the capital.

The Turkish lawmakers are expected to approve the motion at the emergency session and grant a one-year mandate for the deployment, despite concerns that Turkish forces could aggravate Libya's conflict further and destabilize the region.

The Tripoli-based government of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj has faced an offensive by the rival, eastern-based regime and commander Gen. Khalifa Hifter. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violent chaos rivaling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Sarraj requested the Turkish deployment, after he and Sarraj signed a military deal that allows Ankara to dispatch military experts and personnel to Libya. That deal, along with a separate agreement on maritime boundaries between Turkey and Libya, has drawn ire across the region and beyond.

Ankara says the deployment is vital for Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and in the eastern Mediterranean, where it finds itself increasingly isolated as Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel have established exclusive economic zones paving the way for oil and gas exploration.

Details of the possible Turkish deployment have not been revealed. The motion to be debated in parliament allows the government to decide on the scope, amount and timing of the deployment.

Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay told state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkey would send ""the necessary number (of troops) whenever there is a need.""

But he also said Turkey would not dispatch its forces if Libya's rival government halts its offensive.

""If the other side adopts a different stance and says 'Okay we are withdrawing, we are backing down,' then why would we go?"" he said.

Turkey's main opposition party plans to vote against the motion, saying it would embroil Turkey in another conflict and make it a party to the further ""shedding of Muslim blood."" It has urged Erdogan's government to search for a diplomatic solution in Libya instead.

However, Erdogan's ruling party is in an alliance with a nationalist party and the two hold sufficient votes for the motion to pass.

11403669,2020-01-29,"ROME (AP) -- A maritime border agreement between Turkey and Libya's U.N.-backed government is ""unacceptable,"" violates international law and flouts the sovereign rights of other countries, the foreign ministers of Italy and Cyprus said Wednesday..

Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and his Cypriot counterpart Nikos Christodoulides said in a joint statement after talks in Rome that the deal cannot have any legal impact on other countries.

Turkey says the deal grants its economic rights to a large swath of the east Mediterranean sea and prevents any energy-related projects from moving forward without Ankara's consent.

One such project that Israel, Cyprus and Greece had agreed on earlier this month is an envisioned undersea pipeline ferrying natural gas discovered in the east Mediterranean to European markets.

A feasibility study is being carried out on the project which has U.S. and European Union backing . Officials say it aims to lessen Europe's dependence on Russian gas.

Cyprus, Greece and Egypt have denounced the Turkey-Libya deal as infringing on waters where they claim economic rights. Officials from Libya's rival government based in the east of the country have also rejected the agreement.

Christodoulides and Di Maio also agreed that the E.U. should expedite sanctions against specific individuals and companies involved in Turkey's exploratory gas drilling inside Cyprus' economic zone.

Turkey has dispatched warship-escorted vessels to drill for gas in waters off Cyprus, including in areas -- or blocks -- where energy companies Eni of Italy and France's Total have been licensed by the Cypriot government to carry out a hydrocarbons search.

Cypriot officials say two energy companies, which hold licenses for seven of 13 blocks south of Cyprus, are scheduled to drill nine exploratory wells over the next 24 months.

EU leaders have condemned Turkey's actions. Di Maio reiterated Italy's full solidarity with Cyprus against Turkey's drilling activities that are ""completely disregarding Cyprus' sovereignty and sovereign rights.""

Turkey says it's acting to protect its rights and those of breakaway Turkish Cypriots in ethnically divided Cyprus to the area's energy reserves. Turkey claims a large portion of Cyprus' economic zone as falling within its own continental shelf and is drilling at specific targets in line with separate agreements with Turkish Cypriots

Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of uniting the island nation with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a self-styled Turkish Cypriot state in the island's northern third. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, but EU law applies only to the southern part where the internationally recognized government is seated.

11403670,2020-01-11,"ROME (AP) -- Libya's U.N.-backed prime minister on Saturday conditioned his government's participation in a proposed ceasefire to rival forces withdrawing from the outskirts of Tripoli, suggesting no immediate end to the country's civil war.

Prime Minister Fayez Serraj defended his ""bellicose activities"" to protect the Libyan capital, the seat of his government, on the eve of the start date for the truce proposed by Turkey and Russia. Serraj spoke while in Rome for a meeting with Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte.

The meeting was the latest diplomatic effort to end the offensive launched by Serraj's rival in eastern Libya, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, and return the two sides to a U.N.-supported political process.

The presidents of Turkey and Russia this week called for a ceasefire between the warring eastern and western Libyan forces starting Sunday. While Serraj's government welcomed the call, a spokesman for Hifter's self-styled Libyan Arab Armed Forces, Ahmed al-Mosmari, said the group's battalions would still try to take control of Tripoli from what he called ""terrorist groups.""

""We welcome with pleasure the Russian and Turkish initiative that points to a cease-fire, as we are always open to and welcome any initiative that goes in this direction,"" Serraj said in comments after meeting with Conte. ""As long as it is conditioned on the complete withdrawal of the adversary, the attackers. But in our long experience, we do not trust any offers from the attackers because deception is the way they operate.""

Hifter's eastern-based forces launched a fresh offensive in Tripoli in April, sparking a flurry of diplomatic efforts to try to contain the crisis in the North African nation.

The east-based government, backed by Hifter's forces, is supported by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia. The western, Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violent chaos rivaling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Both Russia and Turkey have been accused of exacerbating the conflict in Libya by giving military aid to its warring parties.

Serraj appeared to defend Turkey's decision to deploy troops to bolster his forces, saying his government was ""forced to take part in these bellicose activities which we consider a right to defend the capital.""

Conte is eager to show Italy, Libya's former colonial ruler, as a key facilitator in Libya's political process, and met Wednesday in Rome with Hifter as part of that effort.

Serraj snubbed Conte on Wednesday, but on Saturday thanked Italy for its efforts. The two sides agreed to restart a mixed commission to work out compensation to Libya stemming from Italy's Libyan occupation.

Conte called for an end to ""foreign interference"" in Libya and for the European Union to take an even greater role in returning the parties to political talks, in a clear reference to Russia and Turkey.

""We are convinced this (EU) intervention offers the maximum guarantee to not place the future of the Libyan people at the will of lone actors,"" Conte said.

Later, he called French President Emmanuel Macron, whose government is backing Hifter's forces. A statement from Conte's office said the two ""repeated the importance of a European-level coordination that favors the pacification and stabilization in Libya.""",AP,energy,,"['Rome', 'Tripoli', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Italy', 'Qatar', 'France', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates']","Libya's UN-backed leader welcomes cease-fire, doubts rival",https://apnews.com/08e67aef15df34802ea50262b721cbe0,None,
11403876,2020-05-03,"Thousands of?desperate?migrants are trapped in limbo and even at risk of death without food, water or shelter in scorching deserts and at sea, as?governments close off borders and ports amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Migrants have been dropped by the truckload in the Sahara Desert or bused to Mexico's desolate border with Guatemala and beyond. They are drifting in the Mediterranean Sea after European and Libyan authorities declared their ports unsafe. And about 100 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are believed to have died in the Bay of Bengal, as country after country pushes them back out to sea.

Many governments have declared emergencies, saying a public health crisis like the coronavirus pandemic requires extraordinary measures. However, these measures are just the latest efforts by governments to clamp down on migrants, despite human rights laws.

""They just dumped us,"" said Fanny Jacqueline Ortiz, a 37-year-old Honduran travelling with her two daughters, aged 3 and 12.

Ortiz reached the U.S., but American authorities expelled her to Mexico. The Mexican government in turn abandoned the family on March 26 at the lonely?El?Ceibo?border crossing?with Guatemala. Ortiz and other migrants on the two-bus convoy were told to avoid the Guatemalan soldiers guarding the border, which was closed due to the pandemic.

""They told us to go around through the mountains, and we slept in the woods,"" she recalled.

Over the next few weeks, an activist helped Ortiz and others in her group of 20 find a ride to the next border, in Honduras.

Since the aftermath of World War II, international and some national laws have protected refugees and asylum-seekers. Even if states have the right to close themselves off for national security, they cannot forcibly return migrants to countries where they will face violence and other dangers, according to Dr.?Violeta Moreno-Lax, professor of migration law at Queen Mary University of London.

Yet that is exactly what is happening.

""This is blatantly discriminatory and never justified,"" said Moreno-Lax. ""The pandemic provides the perfect excuse.""

The desert deportations have been happening for years in North Africa and beyond, and Europe has been deadlocked on how to handle migration on the Mediterranean since the 2015 migration crisis. In the United States, President Donald Trump made migration a central issue of his winning 2016 campaign and has unsuccessfully promised to put an end to border crossings from Mexico ever since taking office.

But this year, coronavirus has shifted the dynamic and allowed governments to crack down even harder, even as the desperation of those on the move remains unchanged.

In the United States, Trump is using a little-known 1944 public health law to set aside decades-old?American immigration law. For the first time since the U.S. asylum system was created in 1980, Mexicans and Central Americans who cross the border illegally no longer even get the chance to apply for asylum. Instead, they are whisked to the nearest border crossing and returned to Mexico within hours; asylum-seekers at official crossings are also blocked.

Nearly 10,000 Mexicans and Central Americans were ""expelled"" to Mexico less than three weeks after the new rules took effect March 21, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.?U.S. authorities say the decision was not about immigration but about public health.

Mexico then pushes the migrants further south. Mexico denies that it leaves migrants to fend for themselves, saying it coordinates with their home governments.

The very day Ortiz left El Ceibo, Mexico's secretary for foreign affairs, Marcelo Ebrard, told The Associated Press: ""No Central American is put anywhere in southern Mexico.... We are helping them return to their countries, when their countries and the migrant accept return.""

But the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last week cited a cascade of borders from Mexico to Panama where thousands of migrants are caught out ""in improvised camps, on the streets, or in shelters that have not always implemented health protocols to protect them.""

Migrants have also been left stranded in similarly makeshift conditions in the Sahara, after being expelled without warning from detention centers in Algeria and Libya. The expulsions aren't new but have risen sharply as borders closed with the coronavirus.

Groups of dozens are walking 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 10 miles) through the desert from a desolate no-man's-land called Point Zero to the dusty frontier village of Assamaka in neighboring Niger. There, new arrivals must remain in makeshift quarantine for 14 days.?After the quarantine, those from Niger can go home but foreigners are taken to U.N. transit centers in Niger, where they are stuck because air travel is suspended in and out of the country.

At the end of March,?more than 800 people arrived in Niger in a single?expulsion. Even after Algeria announced expulsions would be suspended because the border was closed, more people kept arriving every day under the punishing sun, including 100 earlier last week, according to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. More than 2,300 migrants are now stranded in Niger, unable to return home or anywhere else.

In Libya, the migrant detention center in Kufra expelled nearly 900 men and women from April 11 to 15, taking them by truck or bus across hundreds of miles of sand and leaving them either in a remote town in Chad or at a Sahara border post in Sudan, according to Lt. Mohamed Ali al-Fadil, the center's director. Hundreds more came the following week.

Al-Fadil said the center is expediting operations, ""deporting more people faster than ever before."" He said the expulsions are an attempt to shield migrants from the coronavirus, including those at the shelter. It's not clear if there have been any virus outbreaks at the shelter. Libya, which is embroiled in internal warfare, has limited testing capacity.

""We fear for the migrants inside these shelters,"" he said. ""We must protect them.""

Yet the large groups of migrants forced out are in danger not only of the coronavirus but of midday temperatures that can rise to 50 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) this time of year.

Al-Fadil?said the center coordinates with authorities in Chad and Sudan so the migrants aren't abandoned in the desert. But the IOM has said those in Chad lack enough food, water and shelter and must quarantine in an open lot in Ounianga?Kébir, a town in northern Chad hardly equipped for mass arrivals.

Tayeb Saleh, a 26-year-old migrant, was expelled from the Kufra detention center in Libya back home to Sudan. He said he and hundreds of other African migrants had languished for weeks at Kufra without clean water or food, awaiting deportation in the desert.

""The situation was unbearable,"" he said. ""I kept thinking if one of us had coronavirus, we would all die.""

Saleh was forced in late March into the back of a crowded truck, which then got stuck in the soft sand that swallowed its axle. After three to four days, he arrived in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, where he recently emerged from quarantine in a jam-packed camp. He said he saw a dozen people left in the empty desert zone in Sudan.

Even for migrants who agree to go home and can reach their own borders, there's no guarantee their home countries will accept them. Dozens of Egyptians deported from Libya were abandoned in the desolate border zone because they lacked identity papers, according to Ibrahim Larbid, the director of the Department for Combating Irregular Migration in the eastern Libyan city of Tobruk.

""The Egyptians won't take them back in,"" he said. ""They must be left in neutral territory until they can retrieve their papers."" As far as he knows, they're still there, awaiting paperwork that may not come for weeks, if ever.

Tunisia also blocked its own citizens from coming back from coastal Libya, leaving around 900 stranded and sleeping outside near an arid frontier post for weeks until they finally stormed the gates. Red Crescent officials said they expect the issue to flare again as more Tunisians try to return home for the Muslim holiday of Ramadan.

Hundreds of migrants are stuck not only in the desert but also at sea in the Mediterranean and the Bay of Bengal.

As of last week, the Mediterranean is going unpatrolled by rescue boats operated by aid groups. The last two such vessels are lashed together off the coast of Italy along with a ferry holding 180 migrants rescued in April, all of them in a 14-day waterborne quarantine within sight of the Italian town of Palermo.

The boats will ultimately dock. But no country has agreed to take in the migrants, who will stay on the ferry until their fate is decided.

""We've never seen states committing crimes of non-assistance in such a blatant light,"" said Lorenzo Pezzani, a researcher for Forensic Oceanography, which investigates abuses in migrant rescues. ""They've done it before but in a more covert way. But now there's a total disrespect of any kind of humanitarian or legal framework. ... It's really worrying and troubling.""

The Libyan coast guard and the Maltese navy both suspended rescues in their own maritime zones, and Italy and Libya this month declared their own ports unsafe -- meaning any commercial ship that picks up migrants at sea has few places to take them. The best hope for thousands of migrants trying to leave Libya's squalid detention centers or cramped smuggler's warehouses for Europe now lies with commercial vessels that are likely to be reluctant to risk their profits during a global economic crisis.

""Libya is a slow death,"" said Mohamed Abdullah, a 16-year-old from the war-ravaged Sudanese province of Darfur who lives in a one-room apartment in Tripoli after three years in detention centers. ""It's a gradual death of waiting. Yes, there are dangers at sea and then the virus in Europe....but at least death by sea is quick.""

That calculation may be wrong for migrants trapped in the Mediterranean with no shelter or hope of rescue, said Marco Martinez, captain of the quarantined Aita Mari rescue ship.

""In winter, in 48 hours you are dead,"" he said. Now, with gentle winds and warmer weather, ""you can make it 4 or 5 days, and you will not have water, no food.""

Half a world away, hundreds of Rohingya refugees are also stuck at sea in the Bay of Bengal. Weeks ago, they boarded at least two fishing trawlers, and are now stranded off the coast of Bangladesh.

Fishermen spotted the boats on April 20, and the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said they may have been at sea for weeks without enough food and water. But the Bangladeshi government said it cannot sustain more refugees and still keep a handle on the coronavirus crisis.

Bangladesh's foreign minister, A.K. Abdul Momen, said Bangladesh has already taken in 1.2 million Rohingya and won't take any more.

""The countries whose coasts touch the sea where these boats are have equal responsibility to take care of them, since this is a humanitarian disaster,"" he said last week. ""They only ask Bangladesh, not anyone else, to take the responsibility.""

Malaysia has also denied entry to several other boats, each with dozens on board. Survivors of another drifting boat that ultimately made it to shore told the aid group Médecins Sans Frontières that around 100 people died waiting.

In her tiny bamboo home in the giant Rohingya refugee camp at Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, Rahima Khatun has been sleepless since her daughter left with her grandchildren on an arduous boat journey more than 50 days ago to join her son-in-law in Malaysia. The 60-year-old has not had any contact with her daughter, Nur Begum, since.

""I don't even know whether they're dead or alive,"" said Khatun, who fled violence in Myanmar.

Though Khatun is not sure which boat her daughter and grandchildren are on, she has heard about the stranded trawlers who were turned back by Malaysia and are being refused entry into Bangladesh.

""If I had wings I would fly and go see where they are,"" Khatun said, weeping on the phone. ""They are not being allowed to enter either Bangladesh or Malaysia - just floating in the middle with no one to help them out.""

11403901,2020-03-18,"CAIRO (AP) -- When Dr. Ismail al-Mansouri goes to work in Yemen's capital, he puts on one of the hospital's few pairs of medical gloves. Then he enters a cramped clinic teeming with listless patients, many malnourished, some vomiting, others with diarrhea.

Al-Mansouri, a pediatrician, has been struggling for years to battle the rapid spread of otherwise preventable and treatable infections, such as cholera, that have surged in war-ravaged Yemen.

Now as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies in the region, he is faced with a new threat, one he can only hope to ward off with a handful of masks.

""I cannot even speak about our preparedness for the coronavirus,"" he said, ""because we have none.""

Long-running wars and conflicts across the Middle East have wrecked potential defenses against coronavirus outbreaks, leaving millions vulnerable in Yemen, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, the Gaza Strip and elsewhere. Health care systems have been gutted; war has blasted key infrastructure. Several of the countries are carved up among rival claimant governments, factions or armed groups, snarling any attempt at nationwide protection programs. Hundreds of thousands of people driven from their homes by fighting are crowded in close quarters in tent camps or improper housing.

""We are becoming very worried,"" said John Nkengasong, director of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as the virus reached conflict-ridden Iraq, Libya, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""The impact will be magnified.""

Most patients who contract the new coronavirus develop only mild symptoms and recover after about two weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by those with no visible symptoms. For older adults and people with underlying health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

So far Yemen, Libya, Syria and Gaza have not confirmed any infections. But doctors in many cases believe the virus has arrived and fear that a lack of disease surveillance systems -- shortages of tests, basic supplies and properly trained professionals -- is allowing an invisible pandemic to spawn.

""We don't have the testing capabilities, so we can only rely on symptoms and signs. But when I do see symptoms and try to report them, no one does anything. People go home, they go out, walk around, eat in restaurants,"" said Dr. Wejdan Sabri, an orthopedic doctor outside Libya's capital, Tripoli. ""I can say with certainty that those likely carrying the virus have continued their lives as normal, passing it to family members and others on the street.""

Sabri is one of two volunteer doctors tasked with infectious disease control for the 2.3 million people in Tripoli, which has been a battleground for warring militias. She said she has seen at least seven patients in the last few days with the signature symptoms of coronavirus. She could only advise them to stay home or visit the central lab in Tripoli, where Libya's few dozen tests can be found. Many of her patients shun testing, fearing quarantine. ""They think they'll go to an isolation unit and die.""

Protective gear across Libya is sparse. A trauma doctor at Tripoli central hospital said 15 surgeons on his night shift share one mask. The main respiratory diseases facility in the east, near the city of Benghazi, has only eight intensive care beds, 10 ventilators and a quarantine room for two.

""We are doing our best but of course it is not enough,"" said its director, Dr. Anas Albarghathy. Last weekend, doctors there found they didn't have the equipment to assemble tests for three patients who had just arrived from Iran, Egypt and Great Britain with fevers and dry cough.

In Yemen, doctors fear that raging war and a humanitarian crisis will only exacerbate the difficulties of determining chains of infection and containing the virus. The country, divided between a rebel-held north and government-run south, has already struggled to stop repeated cholera outbreaks that have infected more than 2 million people and killed nearly 4,000 since 2016.

In Taiz, one of the country's largest cities, Dr. Abdul Rahman al-Azraqi estimated that 80% of the city's hospitals and clinics had been shattered by the war and ongoing siege.

He described the situation in his hospital bluntly: ""There is no training. There is no quarantine. We do not have tests for patients we suspect.""

The World Health Organization has identified two facilities in the country of 29 million people for quarantine and diagnosis, which local director Atlaff Musani acknowledged would soon become ""grossly insufficient."" One, in the rebel-held capital of Sanaa, has the capability to carry out only 200 tests; the other, in the southern city of Aden, can test roughly 300 specimens.

""People are scared because they know the government is not prepared,"" said Dr. Mohamed Rabid, deputy director of the Aden's health office, lamenting that hospitals across the country are desperate for gloves, goggles, ventilators, medicines and other supplies.

Concerns have compounded as the virus sweeps across poorly patrolled borders. Iran, which has emerged as the regional epicenter of the outbreak, frequently sends military advisers and Shiite religious pilgrims to Syria. All 21 confirmed cases in Afghanistan traveled from neighboring Iran. Oil workers circulate between Libya and Italy, a major center of contagion. Thousands of migrants cross Libya's southern frontier, which Elizabeth Hoff, the country's World Health Organization representative, called ""a serious vulnerability that we can't really do anything about.""

In the Gaza Strip, medical infrastructure has been strangled by a 13-year blockade imposed by Israel with Egypt's help, preventing the passage of even critical goods like surgical supplies. While Israel has closed its border crossing, it continues to allow serious medical cases through. Gaza's testing capacity remains severely limited, with enough to process 150 samples. Israel has delivered an additional 200 tests.

In Syria, where nine years of devastating war have left infrastructure and health facilities in shambles, President Bashar Assad's government has conducted 103 coronavirus tests thus far in the country's sole laboratory, which came back negative. Social distancing proves a monumental task in unsanitary refugee camps jam-packed with hundreds of thousands of displaced Syrians.

In Afghanistan, which shares a large border with Iran, Health Minister Ferozuddin Feroz described a growing capacity to test suspected cases at the country's only functioning laboratory, with 30,000 more kits arriving soon. ""We are not in a normal situation,"" Faroz told reporters Monday. ""We are faced with a national threat.""

In Gaza and Benghazi, authorities scrambled to set up new hospitals to handle a possible influx of patients. In Tripoli, Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj announced the allocation of some $360 million to prevent the spread of the virus. Dr. Sabri, the Libyan orthopedic, says she won't get a full night's sleep for a while as she stages awareness campaigns and frantically trains inexperienced nurses in basic sanitation.

Officials in Yemen and Libya offered reassurances this week that things were under control. But not everyone sees it that way.

""People are terrified,"" said al-Mansouri, the Yemeni pediatrician. ""May God protect us.""

11403902,2020-03-03,"ANKARA (AP) -- Facing a potential wave of nearly a million people fleeing fighting in northern Syria, Turkey has thrown open its borders with Greece to thousands of refugees and other migrants trying to enter Europe, and has threatened to send ""millions"" more.

Greece responded by closing the land border, rushing in military and police reinforcements, and tried to stop migrant boats attempting the short but perilous crossing from the Turkish coast to its eastern islands.

Human rights organizations have called for urgent action to stop the situation from deteriorating further, warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis.

Here is a look at the situation at the border, and at whether this the beginning of another migration crisis for Europe.

WHO ARE THE MIGRANTS GATHERED AT THE GREEK BORDER?

Turkey hosts 4 million refugees, some 3.6 million of them from Syria. Previously, their movement inside Turkey was strictly regulated and under a 2016 deal with the European Union, Turkey tightened border controls. Since Ankara announced last week that it would not impede those seeking to enter Europe, thousands of Afghans, Iranians, Syrians, Pakistanis and others from Africa and Asia have rushed to try their luck.

Although the push ostensibly stems from the conflict to Turkey's south, Greek officials say very few of the recent arrivals are Syrians. Most of those arrested Monday were Afghans, Pakistanis and Moroccans. Figures from January, before the intensified fighting in Syria, show 35 percent of those who entered Greece from Turkey were Afghans. Syrians accounted for 14 percent.

HOW MANY HAVE CROSSED INTO GREECE?

By late Monday, Greek authorities had arrested and charged 183 people with illegal entry after crossing the land border with Turkey. Some 24,000 attempts to pass have been thwarted since Saturday. Nearly 1,000 arrived on the Greek islands in the 24 hours up to Monday morning. According to the U.N.'s International Organization of Migration, 13,000 had gathered at the 212-kilometer (132-mile) border by Saturday evening. Turkey, meanwhile, says that more than 100,000 refugees have left its territory but there is no evidence to support this claim. Uneasy NATO allies Greece and Turkey are historic regional rivals who came close to war three times in the past half-century, and even before this crisis relations were tense over undersea exploration rights.

WHY HAS ERDOGAN OPENED THE GATES?

Turkey has long complained about the lack of support it receives for shouldering the burden of caring for the world's largest refugee population. Despite the promise of 6 billion euros to pay for services for Syrians, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to renegotiate the deal with the EU. He says Turkey has spent $40 billion to date on hosting refugees. Ankara also seeks support for its policy in Syria, where it opposes Syrian President Bashar Assad and Kurdish fighters linked to the PKK, which has fought a 35-year insurgency inside Turkey. Erdogan wants to use some territory seized from the Kurds in October to resettle refugees from Turkey but the plan has met with little international support.

COULD THIS BE 2015 ALL OVER AGAIN?

In 2015 a million refugees reached Europe, crossing mainly from Turkey to Greece, and to a lesser degree from countries such as Libya to Italy. Although Erdogan said Monday that ""millions"" would soon be waiting to cross the Greek border, EU border states such as Greece and Bulgaria have quickly mobilized police, border guards and the military to deal with the scenario and seem better prepared to halt large-scale land crossings than in 2015. Sea crossings, however, are much harder to stop. With the Turkish coast guard doing nothing to halt migrant boats heading for the Greek islands, once the flimsy, overcrowded vessels are inside Greek waters they can't be turned back. Very often, their occupants need to be rescued from sinking or crippled boats. Late last year arrivals in Greece were at their highest level since 2016, even before Turkey removed its border controls, and the EU fears a repeat of the crisis that triggered divisions among member states.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR GREECE?

Even before the current crisis, Greece was struggling to cope with tens of thousands of migrants who had entered from Turkey. Most want to continue to more prosperous EU countries such as Germany, but are stuck in Greece following border shutdowns in countries further along their route. Island migrant camps are many times above capacity - more than 20,000 people are on Lesbos alone - and living conditions there are dire. Under the EU-Turkey deal, new arrivals must stay on the islands until their asylum bids are processed, but the lengthy asylum process has led to a big backlog. Island residents are running out of patience after five years of bearing the brunt of Europe's migrant influx, and Greek government efforts last week to build new detention camps on Lesbos and Chios provoked riots on the islands.",AP,energy,,"['Ankara', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'Greece', 'Afghanistan', 'Morocco', 'Libya', 'Italy', 'Bulgaria', 'Belgium', 'Chios', 'Lesbos', 'Germany']",AP EXPLAINS: The new migration crisis at Europe's borders,https://apnews.com/922502f9d8b5922d33af4e1161592943,None,
11403903,2020-02-20,"BERLIN (AP) -- He mixed extreme paranoia about secret state surveillance with far-right conspiracy tropes, misogyny and racist vitriol.

The gunman who killed nine people in the Frankfurt suburb of Hanau left behind a 24-page rambling screed calling for the ""complete extermination"" of races he considered inferior; a video blending far-right diatribes, delusional musings and an infamous quote by Adolf Hitler; and an English-language video statement that echoes themes of child sacrifices and disdain for mainstream media found in the QAnon conspiracy theory.

The attacker was found dead at home along with his mother, who may have been his 10th victim. His website and YouTube channel came down almost immediately, as German authorities tried to prevent his rant from spreading across the internet and morphing into an extremist rallying cry, as happened after the mosque killings in Christchurch, New Zealand, last March.

All of the people he killed during his rampage across the city were of foreign origin.

Identified as Tobias Rathjen, the gunman made no direct references to QAnon, far-right memes or other deadly attacks and their notorious perpetrators such as the killer in Christchurch or the gunman in the German city of Halle who killed two people outside a synagogue on Yom Kippur in October.

Germany's federal prosecutor, Peter Frank, described the rant as stocked with ""confused ideas and far-fetched conspiracy theories."" It was last modified on Jan. 22 and offered no indication he was planning an attack, according to Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group. The English-language video was completed on Feb. 13, she said.

Despite his incoherence, the 43-year-old tapped into an increasingly widespread vein of conspiracy theories originating in the United States, including many by QAnon, and woven into other specifically German themes.

QAnon, a right-wing conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump is fighting ""deep state"" enemies and a child sex trafficking ring, seeped into online chatter associated with the far-right Alternative for Germany party beginning in 2018 but remained on the margins, according to a study last year by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue think tank.

One of the documents posted to Rathjen's website detailed his conviction that he had been under government surveillance since childhood. He blamed the surveillance for his inability to have a relationship with a woman. He also called for wiping out half the world's population.

He wrote: ""The following people must be completely exterminated: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, the complete Arabian Peninsula, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and the Philippines.""

In the English-language video, he warned Americans that they are under the control of ""invisible secret societies,"" and he spoke of subterranean military bases where ""they abuse, torture and kill little children.""

Peter Neumann, a senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London, described the screed as a ""do-it-yourself set of beliefs"" that is increasingly common among violent far-right extremists. The center also analyzed a nine-minute video that ended with a twist on a notorious Hitler quote: ""I don't believe that the people who are laughing today will be laughing in the future.""

""There's a far-right extremist bent to it. There's also misogynism. There's of course evidence of his obsessions, conspiracy theories,"" Neumann said.

An FBI bulletin warned last May about the potential for violence among American fringe political conspiracy theorists. Thursday's rampage may be a new sign that the danger has spread beyond U.S. borders.

Travis View, a conspiracy theory researcher, said that while the gunman's online ramblings suggest he was influenced by a hodgepodge of paranoid conspiracy theories, including QAnon, some of the beliefs expressed by the gunman diverge from QAnon dogma, such as a passage in which he suggests he was responsible for Trump's policies and even political slogans.

""That's very not 'Q.' They think that Trump is this super-genius. They would never be so arrogant to suppose that they could give Trump -- God emperor -- ideas,"" said View, who co-hosts The QAnon Anonymous Podcast and has written about QAnon for The Washington Post under his pseudonym. He works as a marketer for a San Diego company and says he uses the pseudonym to protect himself.

View also said the gunman's delusions about being under surveillance resemble the beliefs of those who call themselves ""Targeted Individuals"" and are convinced that government agents whom they call ""gangstalkers"" are using mind-control devices to monitor and torture them .

The gunman's frustration with women is a common trait among ""incels,"" short for those who are ""involuntary celibate."" The movement, an online subculture linked to deadly attacks in California, Toronto and Florida, promotes the misogynistic idea that men are entitled to have sex with women.

""There's a serious question of whether the mental issues were so severe that we can no longer speak of an act of terrorism. It's not a frivolous question,"" Neumann said.

The Confederation of Kurdish Communities in Germany blamed the political climate in Germany, where a prominent member of the Alternative for Germany party suggested that ""well-tempered cruelty"" is necessary to drive immigrants out of the country.

""Those in positions of political responsibility in this country didn't stand up decisively to right-wing networks and right-wing terrorism,"" the Kurdish group said. Several of the victims are believed to be of Kurdish origin.

Investigators are looking into the German attacker's mental state and whether he had accomplices.

""Such a crime doesn't come out of nowhere,"" said Christine Lambrecht, Germany's justice minister. ""It results from hatred in the country that we urgently need to break through.""

Turkey's heavy military activity in western Libya in recent hours has pushed the Libyan National Army (LNA), commanded by Khalifa Haftar, to declare that it was in ""state of war"" with Ankara.

Turkey's Foreign Ministry had threatened to attack the LNA forces and deem them legitimate targets after they seized a Turkish cargo vessel that was headed to the western city of Misrata earlier this week.

He said the seized vessel was head to Misrata in violation of the arms embargo imposed on Libya.

Meanwhile, the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord vowed to continue to implement its military agreements with Ankara in what was seen as a direct threat to the UN-sponsored ceasefire reached in November.

The Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, renewed its accusations against Qatar and Turkey on seeking to thwart the UN-sponsored peace process in Libya.

LNA's Director of the Moral Guidance Department Major General Khaled Al-Mahjoub denied military movements on the Sirte and Jufra lines, and stated that the LNA is committed to the ceasefire agreement.

He explained that Qatar and Turkey are trying to sabotage the ceasefire, by supporting militias.

Al-Mahjoub added that some formations affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood are trying to obstruct the ceasefire agreement.

The accusation came as the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) signed a new military agreement with Qatar.

GNA Defense Minister Salahudin al-Namroush announced the deal after holding a meeting with the Qatari interior and defense ministers in Doha.

Namroush, during the meeting, discussed developments in the Libyan crisis and Doha's role in boosting the war-torn country's security and stability.

Although he did not give details about the new military agreement, Namroush said it included a protocol for cooperation in training and capacity building.

Local media and sources close to the LNA, however, reported that the deal gives Qatar military foothold and logistics assistance at GNA military bases inside Libya, especially at facilities located in the western city of Misrata.

In a statement, LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari slammed Qatar, ""one of the world's greatest sponsors of terrorism, for using its agents in Libya today to sign a so-called security agreement.""

He slammed the deal as a violation of the Geneva dialogue and a ""suspicious"" attempt to undermine the ceasefire agreement that was brokered by the United Nations last week.

The ceasefire, he added, is aimed at ending the escalation on the ground and ""destructive"" foreign meddling in Libyan affairs.

The LNA statement underlined concerns over Qatar and Turkey - the GNA's main backers - seeking to obstruct the ceasefire.

The GNA Interior Ministry announced on Monday the signing of a security agreement with Qatar on combating terrorism, drug smuggling and money laundering.

The deal was unveiled during a surprise visit by Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha and Foreign Minister Mohammed Siala to Doha where they met with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

The sources, speaking under the conditions of anonymity, said that the GNA and LNA have reached a preliminary agreement to demilitarize Sirte and to establish armistice in the city which is located between Tripoli and Benghazi.

An undeclared arrangement finalized between Turkey and Russia kickstarted the withdrawal of fighters on both rival sides in Sirte, it also ushered in the formation of a joint force that includes elements from the LNA and GNA, the same sources revealed.

Tribes from Libya's three main regions will participate in the joint forces.

According to the arrangement, LNA forces, who currently control Sirte, will redeploy forces to the strategic city's outer skirts in exchange for the GNA also doing the same with regard to repositioning their forces.

A top Libyan official, speaking under the conditions of anonymity, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the demilitarization of Sirte is a prelude for a major deal that will end the crisis and suffering in Libya.

The official pointed out that arrangements being completed in regional and international negotiations will put the military option for ending the conflict in Libya on ice.

Other unofficial sources spoke about intentions to abolish the military and security agreement signed between Turkey and the GNA last year. US and UN officials are discussing with the GNA's interior ministry the merger of its loyalist militias with state security apparatuses.

Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) and France denied on Tuesday reports that a meeting will be held in Paris between Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar and GNA chief Fayez al-Sarraj.

A spokesman for Sarraj said: ""There will be no meeting with Haftar, not in the near or distant future and regardless of the international mediations.""

A spokeswoman for the Elysee in Paris denied that a meeting had been scheduled this week between Sarraj and Haftar.

French media had recently reported that President Emmanuel Macron was seeking to host the two Libyan rivals at a summit in Paris. Speaker of the east-based parliament Aguila Saleh was also set to be invited to the event that was reportedly scheduled for Thursday under the sponsorship of the United Nations and participation of Germany and Italy.

The talks were aimed at ""deepening"" the Libyan consultations and supporting French efforts to reach a new agreement to resolve the current crisis.

Sarraj, meanwhile, has not commented on his alleged intention to resign in coming days.

Sarraj plans to announce his resignation soon but will stay on in a caretaker capacity through negotiations for a new government in Geneva next month, according to officials familiar with his thinking, reported Bloomberg.

By announcing his resignation, he would relieve some of the pressure on himself while setting the stage for his exit after the Geneva talks, two officials told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. The rival sides will be asked to agree on a new Presidential Council structure that unifies the country's dueling administrations and schedule elections.

The Sarraj spokesman refused to comment on the report.

Presidential Council chief Khalid al-Mishri, meanwhile, said the GNA wants to end the current transitional period and hold a constitutional referendum and presidential and parliamentary elections.

In a surprise televised address, he said the Presidential Council and east-based parliament delegations that had met in Morocco last week did not discuss sovereign positions or the transfer of sovereign institutions outside of the capital, Tripoli. He also said the talks did not tackle a reshuffle of the GNA.

Everything that was reported about this was ""pure speculation aimed at obstructing the dialogue,"" he stated.

Separately, GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha announced the formation of a committee that would be tasked with merging armed groups and fighters in his ministry.

Turkey continues to send military cargo planes loaded with weapons to Libya, less than 24 hours after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met the head of the Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez al-Sarraj, in Istanbul.

Itamilradar website, which specializes in monitoring military aircraft, reported that Turkish flights to Libya are ongoing, noting that on Monday morning, a Turkish Air Force Airbus A.400M ""Atlas"" landed in Misrata from Istanbul. It returned to Turkey after unloading its cargo.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that a new batch of about 450 Turkish-backed mercenaries have returned from Libya to Syria, after completing their contracts. Ankara had dispatched them to the North African country to fight alongside the GNA against Libyan National Army (LNA), commanded by Khalifa Haftar.

The mercenaries were transported from Tripoli's Mitiga airport to Istanbul, and they will be sent to areas under the control of Turkish-backed factions in Syria's Aleppo countryside.

Turkey has sent 17,420 Syrian mercenaries to Libya, including 350 under the age of 18. Some 2,500 are Tunisian members of terrorist groups, including ISIS and al-Qaeda. Some 6,700 of the mercenaries have since returned to Syria after their contracts ended and they received their financial dues. Turkey, however, is still bringing in more mercenaries to its training camps before sending them to Libya.

During his talks with Sarraj, Erdogan stressed that Turkey's priority is to ensure stability in Libya by protecting its political unity and territorial integrity.

In a statement from the Turkish presidency said Erdogan called on the international community to assume a ""principled stance"" in this regard.

It described the Istanbul meeting as fruitful, saying the two parties agreement to develop bilateral relations in order to achieve peace, security and prosperity for the Libyan people.

The Turkish president renewed his support to Libya, stressing that achieving peace and calm in Libya will benefit the whole region, especially neighboring countries and Europe.

The meeting also addressed the steps to protect the rights of Turkey and Libya in the Eastern Mediterranean and terms to strengthen the cooperation under the deal signed between the two countries, according to the statement.

Haftar also blamed GNA's Bashagha for being behind the actions of foreign mercenaries in the country.

Their talks came as the Turkish Navy announced that it would conduct massive naval exercises off Libya.

The expected maneuvers would be called ""Naftex"" and would take place off the Libyan coast in three different regions.

The Turkish naval drills will occur in international waters with the participation of 17 warplanes and eight naval vessels to ""prove Turkey's ability to control the region by air and sea.""

With coronavirus lockdown gradually whittled down, last week we started working on a series of conferences on the greater Middle East region for one of the local universities. As we suggested topics we came to Libya where a forgotten war has been going on for almost a decade.

The response from committee members was almost unanimous: Who cares about Libya?

Evil tongues might suggest that, coming from French and British academics, this ""who cares"" sounds like an attempt to hide a shameful family secret.

After all, the tragic mess we witness in Libya today is, in good part, a result of policies pursued by French President Nicholas Sarkozy and British Premier David Cameron who took on the job of toppling Col. Muammar Gaddafi without knowing what they would need to do next.

Cameron's friends tell me that he and Sarkozy were both pushed into the Libyan adventure by then US President Barack Obama who wished to test his ""leadership from behind"" theory which, in turn, flattered the European midgets.

One argument in favor of ""who cares about Libya"" is that there are many forgotten wars in the world, the longest being in Congo-Kinshasa which, in a sense, started in 1960 and, with brief lulls, continues to this day. Another argument is that, with economic recession ahead, Libya's oil resources may be more like a Cinderella than a seductive princess.

However, what is going on in Libya should be of interest to the so-called international community for at least three reasons.

The first is that Libya is currently the largest theater of proxy wars in the Greater Middle East. More foreign powers are involved in the Libyan proxy war than in Syria.

At last count, apart from Britain and France that have remained involved in a homeopathic dose, Italy is also engaged in some shenanigans, albeit mostly in diplomatic form. Then we have Turkey, with Qatar acting as ""deep pockets"", and the international network of Muslim Brotherhood providing the personnel supporting the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.

Led by Fayez al-Sarraj, a technocrat, the GNA also enjoys formal backing from the European Union and the United Nations' bureaucracies.

Recently, Turkey has supplied the GNA forces with home-made drones, known as Bayraqdar (Flagbearer) copied from an outdated American model. Ankara has also recruited an estimated 6,000 Syrian former rebels, most with Muslim Brotherhood background, to fight for the GNA.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tries to justify all that by pointing to more than $30 billion in Turkish investments in Libya under Gaddafi when almost a million Turks worked there. Though Gaddafi had granted Libyan citizenship to many Turks, most immigrants returned home after his fall.

Now, facing mass unemployment at home, Erdogan hopes to see some of those who still have Libyan citizenship, to return there.

In 2019 Turkey signed a series of accords with the Tripoli-based GNA under which Ankara was granted a swath of claims over the Mediterranean. That would enable Turkey to challenge the construction of oil and gas pipelines to ship new offshore resources shared by Israel, Greece, Cyprus and Lebanon. Despite attempts at gaining a foothold, Iran has bene reduced to a bit player in the Libyan drama on the side of Turkey and Qatar.

At the other end of the spectrum, we have Russia, Egypt and several other African states siding with the Libyan National Army of Khalifa Haftar based in Benghazi and loosely in control of the eastern half of what is the world's 18th largest country.

According to Moscow sources, Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes to gain a pause-and-resupply base for his navy on Libya's 1,770-kilometer-long Mediterranean coast to compliment the aero-naval base he has obtained in Tartus, Syria. Reluctant to get involved with boots-on-the ground, Putin has been generous with military supplies including Pantsir air defense systems. More importantly, perhaps, he has given the green light to four Russian private security firms to send military trainers, advisers, technicians and even combat troops to Libya.

Haftar who goes around with the grade of a Marshall is also discretely backed by China which supplies his forces with Wing Loong drones, needed to provide air cover for ground forces.

The second reason why this mini-world war is worthy of attention is that Libya, with the longest shoreline on the Mediterranean, is also neighbor on land to six countries all of which could be de-stabilized or worse. It is no surprise that, thanks to Egyptian efforts, the Libyan dossier is slated to come up in the African Union as a threat to security across the continent.

The third reason for not forgetting Libya is that it is the key transit route for millions of migrants seeking to enter Europe. At a time that coronavirus and its concomitant economic meltdown has focused public attention control of borders and halting immigration, the prospect of millions pouring out of deepest Africa into Libya on the way to Europe is bound to invite some reflection.

It seems that both camps are now aiming at prolonging the status quo under which neither the GNA nor the Libyan National Army (LNA) are capable of delivering the knockout blow and imposing their control over that vast but thinly populated land. A series of seesaw battles, in some of which Haftar's forces scored tactical gains, has shown that without military intervention by a bigger player, neither side is able to kick the other out of the game.

And that brings us to the fourth reason why Libya must not be forgotten. With both GNA and LNA locked in a fratricide struggle, terrorist groups, starting with ISIS and African offshoots of Al-Qaeda have already secured footholds in Libya. To these may be added a dozen ethnocentric groups seeking to carve their own fiefdoms and ready to join either side according to their own advantage. The prospect of Libya being Syrianized must be taken seriously.

Berlin is still unable to end the fighting and flow of weapons to Libya, as Turkey continues to expand its influence there, taking advantage of the world's preoccupation with the coronavirus crisis, according to German magazine Der Spiegel.

Four months after the Berlin conference, which the magazine said was ""a victory for German diplomacy"", peace still eludes Libya and the crisis has only escalated.

Der Spiegel described Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as ""the secret ruler"" of Tripoli, saying Ankara has expanded its presence in Libya, despite his pledge in Berlin to end his support for the Government of National Accord (GNA), headed by Fayez al-Sarraj.

The magazine noted that days after the Berlin conference, a ship loaded with tanks arrived in Tripoli apparently coming from two ports in Turkey. Since then, Turkey has been supplying GNA with fighters, weapons and military equipment, such as drones and a missile defense system.

Members of the Syrian opposition told the magazine that approximately 7,000 Syrians were sent to Libya at the request of Turkey, which pays them as much as $2,000 a month, five times more than what the fighters would receive in Syria.

Ankara is also pressing its allies in Syria to send more fighters to Tripoli, threatening to end its financial support if they do not, according to Der Spiegel.

A fighter told the magazine that Ankara wants each battalion to send 200 fighters, or it will not support them, adding that there is nothing they can do because they can't find other allies.

The magazine quoted a Syrian officer, who he has been in Libya since January, as saying that the situation in Libya is similar to the beginnings of the war in Syria.

""The locals here hate us, and Turkey treats us as pawns,"" he said.

European officials want to restore stability in Libya, but the differences between Italy and France are impeding the European Union's efforts.

The Libyan National Army (LNA), commanded by Khalifa Haftar, declared it will soon ""end the dreams"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, promising that ""major surprises"" were in store for him in Libya.

LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari said the military will end Erdogan's ambitions in Libya ""in days."" He did not elaborate.

""The war is ongoing and we refuse for some sides to speak of declaring victory here or there due to the tactical withdrawal of our forces,"" he told a press conference in Benghazi on Sunday.

""Our operations have not ended yet and what is in store is the destruction of all of Erdogan's dreams,"" he vowed. ""Fighting the Turkish colonization is a holy duty for each honorable Libyan.""

Mismari spoke of ""many turning points"" in recent battles, revealing that the LNA had restored command over the sky in several areas after it had downed over 13 Turkish drones in recent days.

The LNA has not retreated from its areas, but it has redeployed as part of a clear military plan, he clarified.

On the ground, the LNA announced the arrest of a notorious Syrian ISIS member near the capital Tripoli. It identified him as Mohammed al-Ruwaidani, also known as Abou Bakr al-Ruwaidani. It said that he was transferred from Syria to Libya by Turkish intelligence.

Mismari presented the media with photos of Ruwaidani after his arrest, saying he was fighting for a militia aligned with the Government of National Accord.

""This is evidence of Erdogan's ties with ISIS and extremist groups,"" charged the spokesman.

Hours after the arrest, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack that targeted an LNA vehicle at the entrance of the southern town of Taraghin.

Separately, the GNA operations command announced that alleged Russian mercenaries were withdrawing with their heavy equipment from the capital to the airport of Bani Walid, a town some 150 km (93 miles) southeast of Tripoli.

It claimed that they were fighting for the LNA.

Salem Alaywan, Bani Walid's mayor, told Reuters the Russians had now been flown out of western Libya to Jufra, a remote central district and LNA stronghold.

Ghannouchi is coming under unprecedented pressure ahead of parliamentary questioning over his meddling in the country's foreign diplomacy for the purpose of pushing his partisan agenda.

The decision to question Ghannouchi comes following a draft motion filed by the PDL, in which the parliamentary bloc rejected any foreign interference in Libyan affairs and denounced Ghannouchi's utilization of parliamentary diplomacy and positions on developments in Libya, said a statement by the Bureau of the Tunisian House of Peoples Representatives.

Ghannouchi had recently made a phone call to Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) leader Fayez al-Sarraj in which he extended congratulations for the GNA regaining control of al-Watiyya airbase from Libyan National Army (LNA) forces.

PDL said the phone call was in violation to state institutions and compromises the Tunisian state's impartiality towards the conflict in Libya.

The four parliamentary blocs backing PDL's motion to grill Ghannouchi include the Heart of Tunisia (29 votes), the National Reform bloc (15 votes), Tahya Tounes (14 votes) and Al Mustakbal bloc (9 votes).

The four parliamentary blocs also called in a joint statement May 21 to ""respect diplomatic customs,"" insisting on the importance of avoiding any interference with other counties and not involving parliament in the politics of axes, in accordance with the constants of Tunisian diplomacy.

Forces allied with Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) said on Thursday that they have wrestled another key town from the Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar.

Mohamed Gnono, spokesman for the Tripoli-allied forces, announced in a statement posted on social media the fall of the town of al-Asabaa, about 50 kilometers south of Tripoli.

Al-Asabaa is located on a key road that links Haftar's forces besieging Tripoli to Tarhuna, their main western stronghold and supply line southeast of the capital.

On Monday, the GNA of Fayez al-Sarraj seized al-Watiya airbase in Tripoli's southwestern desert reaches.

LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari reiterated that there were 1,500 Turkish military personnel on Libyan soil, fighting on behalf of the GNA.

""The battle is continuing against terrorism, against the Turkish and against the extremists,"" he said at a news conference on Thursday.

Turkey has sent armored drones, air defenses and more recently Syrian militants with links to extremist groups to prop up the GNA.

On Wednesday, Haftar's forces announced they would withdraw up to 3 kilometers from the front line around Tripoli in a humanitarian gesture aimed at giving the residents a respite from the fighting to celebrate Eid al-Fitr.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday that Sergei Lavrov had a call with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavudoglu, and that they underlined the need for an immediate ceasefire in Libya and the resumption of a political process based on decisions made at a conference in Berlin earlier this year.

His move has raised doubts about Tunisia's allegedly neutral stance on developments in Libya.

Libyan sources said that Ghannouchi breathed a sigh of relief as the LNA withdrew from the strategic al-Watiya airbase near the Tunisian border last Monday. The Tunisian politician also asserted that there is no military answer to the raging conflict in Libya and that it is important to return to the political course.

Sarraj, for his part, voiced his gratitude for the feelings of brotherhood expressed by Ghannouchi and praised the deep relations shared with Tunisia.

According to a press release, Sarraj praised Tunisia's keenness on the security and stability of Libya, saying he is looking forward to boost cooperation between the two countries.

Turkey slammed on Tuesday the statement issued against it by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Cyprus, Greece and France over its activity in Libya.

The foreign ministers of the five countries held a teleconference on Monday to denounce Ankara's drilling for potential hydrocarbon deposits in an offshore area where Cyprus has exclusive economic rights, as well as its role in Libyan conflict.

They condemned what they said was Turkey's sixth attempt in less than a year to ""illegally conduct drilling operations in Cyprus' maritime zones.""

Turkey does not recognize ethnically divided Cyprus as a state and claims much of its exclusive economic zone as its own. It has dispatched warship-escorted vessels off Cyprus to drill for gas, insisting that it is acting to protect its interests and those of Turkish Cypriots to the area's natural resources.

Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy criticized Greece and Cyprus for turning to ""relying on irrelevant non-regional actors"" instead of holding dialogue with Ankara.

He defended Turkey's policies, saying they aim to protect its ""legitimate"" interests in line with international law.

The five also protested the agreements signed with Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) as a violation of international law and the UN arms embargo in Libya.

""(The) Ministers strongly condemned Turkey's military interference in Libya, and urged Turkey to fully respect the UN arms embargo, and to stop the influx of foreign fighters from Syria to Libya. These developments constitute a threat to the stability of Libya's neighbors in Africa as well as in Europe,"" the five nations declared.

Last year, Turkey signed a contested maritime border delineation deal as well as a military cooperation agreement with the GNA in Tripoli.

UAE State Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Anwar Gargash hailed the five nations' statement as a ""balanced diplomatic message."" In a tweet, he said the weight of the participating countries and their pursuit of stability cannot be ignored. Their statement formed an important platform that ""prioritizes the international law over the law of the jungle.""

Egyptian former Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Arabi said the five countries should garner more international support to counter Turkey's regional policies that are violating the national security of various countries.

He told Asharq Al-Awsat that their statement coincided with the activation of the European Irini Operation aimed at enforcing the arms embargo against Libya, which will impact Turkey's delivery of weapons to militias in North Africa, the Sahel and Sahara regions.

The Libyan National Army (LNA), commanded by Khalifa Haftar, hailed the five nations' statement as ""international recognition of its legitimacy"" and its ""pivotal role in fighting terrorism.""

MP Mohammed Amer al-Abani told Asharq Al-Awsat that the statement ""sheds light on the extent of Turkey's violations against other countries."" He accused it of abusing Libya's natural resources and intervening directly to kill Libyans.

Abani said it was now time to put a stop to Turkey's ""criminal and terrorist"" behavior, slamming it for threatening international peace. He stressed that the United Nations Security Council must impose sanctions against Ankara to deter it from continuing its malicious policies.

The foreign ministry based in eastern Libya welcomed the statement, renewing its rejection of the deals signed between Ankara and the GNA.

In contrast, the GNA's foreign ministry questioned the five nations' statement, saying it infringes on Libya's sovereignty. It called on Mediterranean countries to review their policies towards Libya and take a clear stand in condemning the ""aggression"" against Tripoli.

Meanwhile, Sarraj, and members of his cabinet, all wearing masks due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, attended a midday parade of military and police forces in Tripoli.

He said that the country was enduring ""several challenges and dangers,"" hoping that next year's celebrations will be held as Libya ""celebrates democracy after the people have their say in presidential and parliamentary elections.""

In the east, Haftar presided over a LNA military parade in the city of Benghazi.

He had kicked off the celebrations by visiting a monument for martyrs and by launching a tree-planting campaign aimed at combating desertification.

On Wednesday, the LNA said that it had detected the ""massive"" amassing of ""criminal and takfiri forces, which are armed with advanced Turkish weapons,"" in the region of al-Hisha, al-Qadahya, Zamzam and eastern Misrata.

The military warned that the forces, which also include thousands of mercenaries and foreign fighters, were preparing to launch an offensive on LNA-held positions in Sirte and al-Jufra.

11404082,2020-12-24,"Lebanese former minister of culture, professor of international relations and former United Nations envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame said the political and economic impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on our daily lives has dwarfed all other issues.

""We are living in an ailing world in every meaning of the word. The pandemic coincided with a time of great imbalance in the global system. Its outbreak accelerated several changes in international relations that had already begun,"" he told Asharq Al-Awsat in an interview.

""It also kicked off changes to that very system, especially in ties between China and the United States,"" he noted.

Moreover, the pandemic exposed the ""vast laziness"" in the West that had already affected its trade and financial relations with China. It is now forced to acknowledge that it has a geopolitical problem with China as well, said Salame.

The coronavirus battle is still ongoing and a new variant of the virus was detected as the vaccine was being rolled out. What conclusions can be drawn from the pandemic?

I believe we are living in a sick and ailing world in both the metaphorical and literal sense. Literally, we are experiencing an unprecedented pandemic. Metaphorically, the global system in which we live in is also sick. I hope that the new year will be one of recovery. However, the imbalance in the global system is so multifaceted and deep that the recovery will take years.

On the individual level, some people want to forget that the pandemic is among us and others are concerned with every minute detail of their lives. The pandemic has affected our daily lives and the lives of humanity. It has also had social impacts.

Such as?

It has left over 1.7 million people dead. This is a small number because it does not take into account people who were killed by the virus without others realizing it. It has infected 70 million people and those are just the registered figures. The real figures are actually much greater. A friend of mine, who is a specialist, told me that over 300 million people had caught the virus.

What about the economy?

There has been a massive impact: India has lost a quarter of its annual production. Whatever global growth we had predicted for this year transformed into a 7 to 9 percent recession. The wealthy countries of the West are trying to compensate those who were impacted economically. They have spent in nine months at least triple what they did in addressing the 2007 global economic crisis. I believe trillions more will be spent and that will take years to make up.

We have also realized things we had not previously paid attention to. We noticed just how fragile the tourism sector is. Countries that are dependent on tourism were dealt very heavy blows. It will take years for people to grow accustomed to traveling again.

The pandemic has also made some people even wealthier. Jeff Bezos, Amazon chief, doubled his fortune and managed to hire thousands of people to deliver products to people at home. The pandemic is the single most significant development of 2020 that all other events seem trivial.

But vaccines have been developed...

True, but we are not certain of their long-term effect. We are not certain of the effectiveness of the vaccine if the virus mutates. We are also uncertain if billions of people around the world will be able to have access to the vaccine before the virus infects them. This is a race between the vaccines and the virus, especially since we have yet to find a medicine to treat this disease. There is no guarantee that we will not be struck by another pandemic. So, the world has been upended by the pandemic. The results are monumental and ongoing for the foreseeable future despite the vaccines.

What about the greater picture, such as China? Some believe that China's rise was already on the table and that the pandemic only accelerated this issue. Second, the pandemic has also raised questions about democratic systems, especially since China attempted to promoted itself as having the best example in how to handle pandemics.

The issue of China has been posed for a while, which is why we should approach it calmly. The country kicked off rapid change 30 years ago and has managed in three decades to end the poverty of millions of Chinese people, transforming the country into a major market. Most significantly it is the factory of the world. Throughout that time, the world approached China away from geopolitical considerations, but that changed some five or six year ago. Attention then shifted to its military spending.

Some observers began to ask: Are you aware of China's military spending? Have you noticed that it was the first country to build an aircraft carrier? Did you note that it developed artificial islands that can rapidly be transformed into military bases?

I also would like to ask: Did you notice that a war broke out between China and India for the first time in decades? Did you notice that for the first time, China reacted firmly in Hong Kong and against democratic trends?

But Chinese President Xi Jinping had spoken of the priority he sets on the military...

When the Chinese president says that he wants his country to be the strongest military in the world by 2050, then many countries will be worried. They know that China does not make empty promises. Japan has increased its military budget and is buying 150 of the latest F-35 model and India is bolstering its border security, while demands for the US to withdraw from its Asian bases have waned.

Addressing China's geopolitical rise began before the pandemic. The pandemic only gave a demagogical angle to the issue when US President Donald Trump spoke of the ""Chinese virus"". He uttered those words just as the US was beginning very critical trade negotiations with China. Those talks began when the West sensed that globalization, which it had benefited from for a long time, was now becoming more beneficial to non-western countries. That sense began to emerge in the West even though no one was openly talking about them. Then came Trump, who said that he wanted to review trade relations with China because it was benefiting more than globalization that the West was.

Years before the pandemic, the West had started to negatively view globalization. Then the pandemic happened and China showed its superiority in sending out medical support to and containing the outbreak in Wuhan. It again proved that globalization allows China to boost its image and control over the global system in a way that the West can no longer keep up. The same West realizes that the United States' share of the global economy shifted from 45 percent in post-WWII 1945 to 17 percent today.

Demographically, the number of white men dropped from 30 percent in the early 20th century to less than 17 percent today. Therefore, there is a sense that globalization allowed western companies to reduce production costs through shifting production to China and Asia. They ended up opening a new market for western products - China. But globalization began to come at a price, which was costlier than the benefits.

Then the pandemic happened, and demonstrated all of this...

The pandemic established a new concept, that of health sovereignty - meaning modern countries discovered that they had erred during globalization when they had sought lower production costs at the expense of local production of medicine. Of the first dozen coronavirus vaccines that were produced, five were made in China. This achievement will be highlighted even further when dozens of countries will procure the Chinese vaccines given their low prices. France suddenly discovered that it does not produce its face masks and that its Panadol pills are made in India. This will all change after the pandemic. Many countries will reconsider their view of globalization and address their weaknesses that it laid bare.

What about the difference between democratic nations and totalitarian ones? Did the pandemic change the rise in populism?

During the 1990s and for a first time in history more than half of the people in the world shifted from living under a totalitarian state to a democratic one. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, this began to change. First, because the number of countries embracing democracy began to drop. Many countries witnessed military coups or totalitarian coups through elections. Second, the growth of populism in democratic systems. The technological revolution helped populism infiltrate the heart of democratic life in several countries, such as Hungary, the US and Brazil.

The cyber revolution also helped spread populism, but it also helped the excessive meddling in the affairs of other countries. We will obviously witness more cyberwars in the coming months and years. They will stoke tensions between major powers and weaken trust between world leaders.

Can we say that democratic countries are ill?

Quality of life in democratic countries is dropping, but does that mean they are incapable of addressing such crises as the pandemic while totalitarian ones can? I'm not sure of the answer. I believe that Asian countries were more efficient, regardless of their system of rule, such as South Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Taiwan. They do not have the same system as China, but they managed to tackle the pandemic better than democratic countries.

So where lies the problem?

The problem is that the pandemic demands that governments, in countries such as Britain, France and Italy, impose restrictions on public freedoms. The foundations of these democratic countries are built on such freedoms. I believe these countries will, however, be able to return to their freedoms once the pandemic is over. Concluding that totalitarian countries are more capable maybe a hasty theory, but it is plausible and worth debating.

A debate that raged between democratic and totalitarian countries before the pandemic was which system was more efficient in pushing forward social and economic development. China, with its capitalist one-party rule, said that it was the best in terms of development.

Totalitarian countries can impose limits on freedoms during the pandemic because they had done so even before the outbreak. When they impose restrictions on freedoms, democratic countries violate the foundation on which they are built. Western countries will debate for years to come over how soon they will be able to restore their democracies or keep in place the pandemic restrictions.

What about the US? How did the pandemic impact its role?

I believe the US presidential election was decided by the pandemic. It was not decided because the pandemic happened, but because how poorly President Trump handled it. He alleged that life will return to normal by April and that the virus was not dangerous. He then politicized mask-wearing and allowed large gatherings without health precautions. The Trump administration's mismanagement of the pandemic cost him the election.

This shows us an important lesson that role of people in the course of history is marginal. Forces have an impact on history, not individuals. In this case, Trump's individual behavior was the antithesis of this. Had he acted differently, he would have secured reelection. The result of the election was all up to Trump himself.

What about your statement that Joe Biden's election is the third chapter of a book we have already read?

Biden has introduced new faces to his administration, but most of the figures are familiar. We have seen them twice under the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations. Have there only been two democratic administrations in the post-Cold War era? A Clinton administration and an Obama administration. Now Biden's team is a third chapter of a book we have already read. Will he be able rectify the errors of his predecessors?

What errors?

Clinton was very dismissive of the Soviet Union and Boris Yeltsin. He failed in building a relationship based on trust with the new Russia and we are still paying the price of that to this very day. There is real anger in Russia in the way the West, especially the US, dealt with Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. We are paying the price of this at the United Nations Security Council. We are paying the price of this in Libya, Syria and other countries. Has the new Democratic administration reviewed this historic error, or will it be a copy of its predecessors?

The same goes to China and the intervention in wars in Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. Has there been anyone in America in the past four years who has said: ""If I were to return to power, then I will not commit the same mistakes as the previous Democratic administrations."" This is the first question posed to Biden.

And the second?

""Have I realized that the world has changed and that we are no longer in 1990 and that the US is no longer the leader or the sole leader of the global system?"" Several countries have started to meddle in the affairs of their neighbors. Some countries are working daily on developing their military. Turkey is embroiled in four wars, so is Iran.

Is there anyone in this administration who has carried out this review? Is there anyone who has reviewed America's position in a world that is vastly changed, not because of Trump, but because the entire system has changed? It is naïve to blame Trump alone for this change.

When you look at the core of issues, there was an issue with Trump's character, such as his provocative tweets and his sudden sacking of officials. This personality, however, came back and managed to garner the votes of 60 million Americans. He has a real popular base. This figure tried to achieve something with North Korea, opened the trade file with China and did not launch a new war in the world.

I fear that the new administration will say that the past four years have been a break and that it will return things to how they were before, such as with the climate agreement, World Health Organization and the Iran nuclear deal.

Is that possible internally?

If this is the main focus of the new administration, I believe it will fail because the majority of the US Supreme Court is conservative and Republicans make up the majority of Congress.

What about Europe as it deals with Brexit, populism and immigration?

Let's say it bluntly, those who believe that Brexit would lead to the break up of the European Union have been proven wrong. The evidence is immense, first, other countries did not follow suit in quitting the union. Moreover, and in a first, Germany accepted demands by France, Spain and others, for the EU to take out loans to tackle the economic impact of the pandemic. In other words, the pandemic helped reinforce the financial strength of the union. In Britain, recent figures showed that supporters of Brexit have dropped.

So, the EU succeeded in spite of the enormity of the pandemic challenge. It overcame the first phase of the pandemic and now is faced with the challenge of taking decisions unanimously. Such decisions demand consensus on central issues. If some countries lean further towards populism and the curbing of freedoms, such as Poland and Hungary, then this basis of consensus will undoubtedly be obstructed.

What about the relationship between Europe and the US?

Europe will be taking a more hostile approach towards Chin after the pandemic. America was already following such a path, but Europe was not prepared for it. Now, after my recent visit to Germany and the change in French President Emmanuel Macron's rhetoric, there are concerns that China may invest its financial and economic capabilities in geopolitics. We have seen the concern over China's purchase of a port in Greece and Algeria. The US and Europe are almost seeing eye-to-eye on China. Perhaps the most telling sign of this shift is the European Parliament's vote over the Uighur issue.

Is the position towards Russia different?

Macron has a real desire to build a strategic relationship with Russia. He made this point clear in September 2018, but nothing has been achieved on the ground. There is also the gas pipeline that Germany is building with Russia and that the US opposes. The Biden administration and Europe may differ over Russia, but they share common positions over China.

At the beginning of the pandemic UN chief Antonio Guterres called for a coronavirus truce in conflict-ravaged countries, such as Libya and Syria. How do you assess the response to the call?

He was right to make the plea, but the response fell short of expectations. First, the Security Council took weeks and weeks to take a decision over this issue. Why? It is clear. Confronted with the pandemic, we must pause and assess what is more dangerous and what the fighters are facing. Why the delay? Because the US wanted to remind China and underline its lack of trust in the WHO. The situation at the Security Council politicized the pandemic and as a result, the response to Guterres' call was more complicated.

What about the resolution of conflicts?

No country complied. But the pandemic did impose itself on fighters. Notice in Libya, how both sides were in denial over the severity of the pandemic. That was until the fighters started to become infected. This led to a gradual ceasefire and the 5+5 meeting in Geneva that cemented it. The pandemic played a role, no doubt in that. Had the fighters pushed ahead with the war, then we would have had a real massacre on our hands. If you were not killed by your enemy's bullet, then the virus will get you. So you were confronted with two choices: A bullet from the other side of the divide, or a virus from your close ally.

What about the future of UN agencies after the pandemic?

The pandemic was a major challenge, but the greatest challenge lies ahead in the years to come. Several UN agencies will be demanded to provide much more than they had done before. The World Food Program is an example. It needs billions to feed the poor all over the world. The refugee program needs a budget to address millions of refugees. The WHO and UNICEF play central roles. They all demand budgets worth billions of dollars. Where will they come from? They come from all countries of the world, but in reality, they are provided from western countries. Here lies the challenges, if these wealthy countries, especially the western ones, need the money to address their own economic recessions, massive unemployment, secure vaccines and medical and hospital needs, will they offer additional dozens of billions of dollars to address the impact the pandemic has had on poor countries?

I believe wealthy countries will use their money for their own needs. Capable countries will be unable to finance UN agencies, which will be a major challenge to the UN.

Politically, what about relations between major powers?

The ties are bad. I hope that they will improve under the Biden administration. The Security Council practically plays no role in global crises, as we have seen in Nagorno-Karabakh and the dispute between China and India. The UN is playing a practically nonexistent role in several conflicts, such as Syria or the demarcation of the marine border between Lebanon ad Israel. That is a classic situation where the UN can play a central role, but it was filled by the US. The UN's role in global peace and security weakened due to the disputes between major countries.

Libya seems to be headed on a new path. What is your assessment of the situation?

Libya presents a unique case in which the UN is in a hurry to lead a settlement process. Several countries want to play that role, but the UN mission has managed to keep itself on top despite the great challenges. I am proud. I say that without hesitation. I am proud of what we have achieved in the past two years in very difficult conditions. We brought together under the same roof Presidents Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and Recep Tayyip Erdogan. We arranged the Berlin conference on January 19 and all countries involved in Libya made important pledges. They left it up to the Libyans to implement them. After great difficulty, we managed to reach resolution 2510.

What about the execution?

When it came to implementation, developments took a wrong turn. Some sides sought to obstruct the implementation of the Berlin conference. Fighting erupted over Tripoli, then the pandemic happened. It was only until the summer that the Berlin conference decisions, which I proudly oversaw, began to be implemented. Is the implementation taking place at the pace I want? No. Can the fighting erupt again? Yes. Can foreign meddling return to the way it was before the Berlin summit? Yes. Have the mercenaries pulled out as we wanted? No. Have all roads been reopened? No.

What are the positives?

If you compare the situation now in Libya to the way it was months ago, then it is better. Flights have resumed between cities, roads have reopened, the displaced have returned home, the central bank board met for the first time in three years and political dialogue was launched in Tunisia. All of these developments point to one thing: The Libyans have grown more aware.

Military offensives were launched and have failed. They realize the need for political understanding. They are also aware that any such understanding should take place through the UN because it has no oil or business ambitions in the country. As opposed to other countries, the UN cares about the Libyans themselves, not just their wealth. Furthermore, there is a realization among the many meddling countries that no single one of them is capable of coming out on top and of solely controlling Libya. They must agree to share influence.

There are weak signs that the we are headed in the right direction in Libya. It will take time, but despite the obstacles I am optimistic that Libya will get itself out of the mess it has gotten itself into.

What about Lebanon? Reports speak of poverty, immigration, no government and the end of the Taif Accord.

Let me just say that the actual implementation of the Taif Accord has ended. Some aspects of the accord, such as its institutional parts, establishing the troika and sectarian elements - such as weakening some sects and strengthening others - were implemented. This implementation of the Taif is behind us. Is there a need for a more loyal implementation of the accord or is there a need to come up with a substitute agreement? I support the first idea. I believe that the Taif Accord, in its essence, helped end the civil war that claimed the lives of 170,000 Lebanese people. I will not so easily abandon it. However, I believe that the actual implementation of the accord tarnished the spirit of the agreement. If you ask me to choose between a more loyally implemented Accord with some amended articles, or search for a purer alternative, I would choose the former.

You said that the ""Lebanon intifada"" exposed the sectarian leaders. How?

The main political class and opinion polls say so. The political elite has lost a lot of its popular base. The Lebanese were shocked with just how much the political class undermines them. They were shocked with the collapse of the banking sector. They have stood helpless as they life's savings evaporated and they were no longer able to pay for their children's education. They were shocked again with the Beirut port explosion. French President Macron toured the streets of Beirut, while not a single Lebanese politician can go to a restaurant without being humiliated and kicked out. The political class has become aware of just how much they are reviled by the people. The surveys that are carried out and not published reveal this as well.

What about the formation of the government?

The government could have been formed before we even finish this interview. However, there are two obstacles. The first is the dramatic drop in popularity of the majority of the country's leaders. They are therefore, using this time to boost their support among their sectarian base instead of acting swiftly to reach an understanding that can halt the tragic collapse of the country.

The second is that these leaders know that as soon as they form a government, it will be bombarded with international demands and pressure to take unpopular austerity measures. It will be demanded to carry out fundamental reforms in the finance and banking sectors. This will not take place before the real detailed facts and figures of the state's finances throughout the past 60 years are revealed. Several politicians fear the close scrutiny for obvious reasons.

This is why they continue to evade Macron's pressure and remain in a state of denial of the need for a swift agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The government should have been formed soon after the Diab government resigned in August just after the horrific port blast.

My fear is that the growing poverty among Syrian and Palestinian refugees and the Lebanese people themselves will push them to rely further on their sectarian leaders. They will need to turn to someone who will support them. I fear that this crisis will only help these leaders rise up again by helping those in need, who are willing set aside their anger in order to survive.",Asharq Al-Awsat English,energy,,"['United States', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'India', 'China', 'France', 'Wuhan', 'Vietnam', 'Taiwan', 'Syria', 'Lebanon', 'Laos', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Italy', 'Hungary']",Ghassan Salame to Asharq Al-Awsat: Ailing World Needs New American Approach,https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2701031/ghassan-salame-asharq-al-awsat-ailing-world-needs-new-american-approach,None,
11404083,2020-12-24,"Turkey is boosting its influence across North Africa, analysts say, intervening militarily in war-torn Libya and using ""soft power"", trade and investment in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has in recent years asserted Ankara's role as a regional player, sparring with Greece and the European Union as well as with Russia and Gulf nations.

Turkey's growing influence in the Maghreb is the result of Erdogan's ""neo-Ottoman and pan-Islamic"" foreign policy strategy, said historian Pierre Vermeren of Sorbonne University.

""It really started in 2011 at the time of the Arab Spring"" when popular revolts toppled the region's rulers and Turkey backed Islamic movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, he said.

""In 2020 there was a sudden acceleration of Turkish influence, which is now direct with its intervention in Libya, putting Turkish soldiers and mercenaries on the borders of Algeria and Tunisia.""

Ankara-backed networks are promoting Turkey ""through social media and the press,"" Vermeren said, according to AFP.

Political analyst Ali Bakeer, based in Ankara, agreed that ""Turkey is seeking to strengthen its relations with the countries of the Maghreb region as a part of its opening up on Africa strategy.

""Turkish-Algerian relations are emerging fast. Meanwhile mutual interests between Turkey and Libya are evolving day by day. When it comes to Tunisia and Morocco, Turkey is trying to focus on the mutual economic benefits.""

Hard power in Libya

Turkey's impact has been most dramatic in oil-rich Libya, which was thrown into chaos after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising toppled and led to the killing of long-time ruler Moammar al-Gaddafi.

Ankara's help with military advisers, materiel and mercenaries -- echoing its interventions and defense support from Syria to Azerbaijan -- proved decisive this year when it rescued the Government of National Accord.

Turkey helped the Tripoli-based GNA push back an offensive by forces loyal to eastern-based Libyan National Army commander Khalifa Haftar.

This also helped Turkey on a separate issue, a contest with Greece and Cyprus for offshore gas deposits, after Ankara signed a deal with the GNA laying claim to vast maritime territories.

Emadeddin Badi, an analyst at the Global Initiative Network, said that ""Turkey is trying... to leverage its military investment for influence"".

Its military footprint is now significant in Libya, a country seeking a permanent peace following a UN-brokered ceasefire.

""Turkey has the largest military base on the Tunisian border, a naval base, (and) camps populated by Syrian mercenaries,"" said Jalel Harchaoui of the Clingendael Institute in The Hague.

Turkey's parliament on Tuesday authorized an 18-month extension of its Libya troop deployment.

Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco

In the countries west of Libya, Turkey's focus has been on trade and investment.

More than 1,200 Turkish companies have set up shop in Algeria, a country Erdogan visited early this year and also helped with Covid-19 medical supplies.

Turkey has become the third largest importer of Algerian products, and the two countries aim to boost trade to 4.1 billion euros ($5 billion) a year.

In other outreach, Turkey helped in recent years with the restoration of the Ottoman-era Ketchaoua Mosque in Algiers.

Turkish imports to the Maghreb region have risen sharply, especially ""Made in Turkey"" textiles that squeeze out locally made goods.

""The Turks have flooded the textile market and killed many Moroccan brands,"" said one manufacturer in the kingdom, which in October revised a 2006 free trade deal.

In Tunisia, businesses have also been hit by low-cost Turkish products which have increased since a 2004 free trade deal, and Tunis in 2018 reimposed some import duties.

11404084,2020-12-23,"A number of political observers and experts warned that regional powers, such as Pakistan, are trying to establish a foothold in Libya, which will further complicate the situation in the country.

Recently, Defense Minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA) Salah al-Namroush received the Pakistani military attaché in Libya, Brigadier Atif Talha.

Talha announced his country's desire to enhance the military cooperation with Libya in the fields of counterterrorism, demining, and disposal of explosive wastes.

Member of the House of Representatives (HoR) Ali al-Takbali wondered the reason behind Pakistan's involvement in Libya at the current time, despite the established relations between the two countries.

He indicated that Pakistan is trying to cooperate with Libya in the security and military field, at such a difficult time in the country.

Speaking to Asharq Al-Awsat, Takbali indicated that the Turkish intervention in Libya encouraged most countries in the region to follow Pakistan's league.

He explained that rival regional powers in the Middle East have long sought to intervene in Libya and North Africa after Turkey preceded them.

The lawmaker indicated that Pakistan's interest in Libya could lead to India or perhaps Iran's involvement, noting that this will further complicate the situation.

GNA's Defense Minister allows foreign intervention thus leading to the failure of any political solution, which if reached, will not allow him to remain in position, according to Takbali.

For his part, Libyan security expert and head of Silphium Center for Studies and Research, Gamal Shallouf, fears that the Libyan treasury would finance any deals concluded or to be concluded between Pakistan and Turkey, in light of their apparent rapprochement over the recent period.

Shallouf told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Turkish Air Force still suffers from the repercussions of the failed coup attempt in 2016, which prompted Ankara to seek the help of foreign military pilots and experts, especially in F-16 fighter.

Ankara had already requested the assistance of Islamabad, he noted, adding that in light of the difficult economic situation, it would be possible to include the costs of training or hiring of Pakistani pilots in Turkey in the bill for any potential Pakistani training of GNA forces.

Meanwhile, the security expert at al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, Ahmed Kamel el-Buheiri, highlighted the possibility of Turkey seeking to establish a Libyan army that mimics the Pakistani military model.

He explained that the Pakistani army succeeded in agreeing with the religious establishment of various currents, including Salafists, the Brotherhood, and more extremist groups.

The expert stated that the danger will be trying to imitate the Pakistani army, that is, merge the Libyan military establishment with the Islamic current which controls the GNA.

Turkey will establish an army of a religious nature, and Pakistan will receive the financial revenues that will be paid from the proceeds of Libyan oil, according to the expert.",Asharq Al-Awsat English,energy,,"['Pakistan', 'Libya', 'Turkey', 'Iran', 'India', 'Islamabad', 'Ankara']","Libyans Fear Rapprochement Between GNA, Pakistan",https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2699126/libyans-fear-rapprochement-between-gna-pakistan,None,

Montenegrin Zoran Filipovic has become the third coach of Libya this year after Tunisian Faouzi Benzarti and local Ali Merguini.

He previously worked in Africa 10 years ago, saving South African Premiership club Golden Arrows from relegation during 12 months with the Durban club.

""I promise to give my all to the cause of the Libyan national team,"" said the 67-year-old during a press conference in Tripoli.

Here, AFP Sport rounds up news from Africa.

The first task of Filipovic, who was capped 13 times by the then Yugoslavia as a forward, will be to prepare Libya for the African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Cameroon next month.

Libya secured a place in the competition for footballers playing in their country of birth after Tunisia, the team that defeated them in a qualifier, withdrew.

The Mediterranean Knights were crowned CHAN champions in 2014 and next month will face the two-time title-holders Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo Brazzaville and Niger in Group B.

Confederation of African Football (CAF) deputy general secretary for football and development and former Ghana star Anthony Baffoe says he is ""very satisfied"" with 2023 Africa Cup of Nations preparations.

The main venue in host nation the Ivory Coast, the 60,000-seat Stade Olympique Alassane Ouattara in commercial capital Abidjan, has been completed and officially opened.

Three other new stadiums, in Korhogo, San Pedro and Yamoussokro, are being built and existing stadiums in Abidjan and Bouake renovated.

South Africa

The South African Football Association (SAFA) has performed a financial u-turn, posting a profit of 53 million rand ($3.6 million/3 million euros) this year.

Last year, the national body suffered a loss of 74.5 million rand, after which there was a change of chief executive with Tebogo Motlanthe taking over.

A star of the Algerian national youth team is forward Mohamed Belloumi, whose father, Lakhdar, was among the best footballers in Africa during the 1980s.

Many pundits are drawing comparisons not only between Mohamed and his father, but also with Manchester City winger and Algeria captain Riyad Mahrez.

However, Belloumi junior could not prevent his country being eliminated this week from a regional qualifying tournament for the 2021 Africa U20 Cup of Nations in Morocco.

Cameroon

Cameroon Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute hopes up to half of the seats at the four match venues can be available for spectators during the January 16-February 7 African Nations Championship.

""Social distancing must be observed because of the coronavirus so we will propose to the head of state that between 30 and 50 percent of seats can be occupied,"" he said.

The 16-team tournament kicks off at the 42,500-capacity Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde with a match between Cameroon and Zimbabwe.

Egypt

Zamalek have rejected a 2.5 million euro ($3.05 million) bid from Ligue 1 outfit Nantes for star forward Mostafa Mohamed, an official told the TV channel of the Cairo club.

""French club FC Nantes have submitted an offer for Mostafa Mohamed, and the player is insisting on leaving for Europe,"" he said.

""The club will let Mostafa leave, but only after the Olympic Games (Egypt are among three African football qualifiers), so now he has to focus only on Zamalek.""

The commander of the frigate, Jan Fitchen, said that the mission made a clear and significant contribution to achieving stability in the maritime region off Libya.

With more than 200 soldiers on board, the team of the German frigate managed to stop a tanker on its way to illegally transport kerosene to Libya.

Last month, the German soldiers also boarded and tried to search a Turkish cargo ship that they suspected of carrying illegal weapons, however, they withdrew after Turkey raised objections with the EU mission.

At the time, Turkey revealed that the vessel was carrying various materials, such as food and paint, stressing that German soldiers violated the principle of freedom of the open seas.

The move removes the Force's subordination to Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha.

During his visit, Kamel met with the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) Khalifa Haftar and the head of the Libyan House of Representatives Aguila Saleh.

A number of issues of concern were discussed. This came within the framework of the Egyptian role in support of stabilizing the situation in Libya and preserving its capabilities and gains, a GIS statement said.

In Kamel and Haftar's meeting, the statement said, emphasis was placed on the Egyptian efforts and moves in support of the outcomes of the 5+5 Military Commission meetings, which resulted in delaying the ceasefire and taking a number of measures that have contributed to stabilizing the military and security situation throughout Libya.

The 5+5 Joint Military Commission, which brings together five military officials from the eastern and western camps in the Libyan conflict, is one of the three tracks of the settlement process that emerged during the Berlin Conference on Libya in mid-January.

The United States on Monday unsealed criminal charges against a third alleged conspirator in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.

The Boeing 747 exploded and killed 190 Americans. ""No amount of time or distance will stop the United States and our Scottish partners from pursuing justice in this case,"" US Attorney General William Barr told a news conference Monday.

The suspect, Abu Agila Mohammad Masud Kheir Al-Marimi, a former senior Libyan intelligence official, is charged with two criminal counts related to the bombing. He is in Libyan custody, Barr said Monday, and US officials are hopeful that Libya will allow Masud to be tried in the United States.

The Justice Department said Masud worked in various capacities for Libyan intelligence, including as a technical expert in building explosive devices from approximately 1973 to 2011. It also alleged Masud was involved in the 1986 bombing of the LaBelle Discotheque in West Berlin, Germany that killed two US service members.

In 1991, two other Libyan intelligence operatives were charged in the bombing: Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.

The United States and Germany earlier this month proposed that the Council's 15-member Libya sanctions committee impose an asset freeze and travel ban on Kaniyat.

Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Wednesday that as a result of Turkish intervention in Libya ""the balance in Libya changed significantly"" in favor of Fayez al-Sarraj Government of National Accord.

The recent developments in Libya resulted from Turkish training and advice, according to Hulusi, knowing that the GNA forces announced regaining control of Al-Watiya airbase, in the west of the country.

In the previous period, Turkey supported Sarraj's government and its militias against the Libyan National Army.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan admitted, earlier, transferring armed men from pro-Ankara Syrian factions to Libya.

The Syrian Observatory reported that Turkey has recruited nearly 10,000 militants to fight in Tripoli. Also, six Turkish military cargo aircraft traveled from Turkey to South Africa with a small amount of medical supplies on board.

Libya's rivals on Monday began a second round of talks on a mechanism to choose a transitional government that would lead the conflict-stricken country to elections in December next year, the United Nations said.

UN acting envoy for Libya Stephanie Williams headed the online meeting of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum a week after the first round of the talks in Tunisia failed to name an executive authority.

The 75-member forum reached an agreement to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on Dec. 24, 2021. They also agreed to name a volunteer legal committee to work on the ""constitutional basis for the election.""

The political forum was the latest effort to end the chaos that engulfed the oil-rich North African nation after the 2011 overthrow and killing of longtime ruler Moammar al-Gaddafi.

The UN mission in Libya said last week it was investigating allegations of bribes paid for some participants in the forum to vote for certain names to be part of the transitional government. The mission did name anyone but vowed to impose international sanctions on anyone obstructing the talks.

The forum took place amid a heavy international push to reach a peaceful settlement to Libya's conflict. Previous diplomatic initiatives have all collapsed.

The warring sides agreed to a UN-brokered cease-fire last month in Geneva, a deal included the departure of foreign forces and mercenaries from Libya within three months.

No progress was announced on the issue of foreign forces and mercenaries a month after they inked the ceasefire deal. Thousands of foreign fighters, including Russians, Syrians, Sudanese and Chadians, have been brought to Libya by both sides, according to UN experts.

The United Nations and its Security Council have threatened to sanction parties obstructing the implementation of the ceasefire that was agreed last week by delegations from the east-based Libyan National Army (LNA) and Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).

Despite the warning, informed sources in the capital Tripoli revealed that the ceasefire may stumble at efforts to disband militias that are loyal to the GNA.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said that GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha had devised a plan to disarm the militias and other armed factions that are loyal to the government.

These efforts have been met with refusal by faction leaders, who have rejected Bashagha's labeling them as militias even though the minister enjoys the support of the American administration and United Nations mission in Libya.

The sources predicted that clashes will intensify in coming days between the militias and GNA.

Bashagha has sought to restructure the militia by merging them in some security units.

The sources added that the militia loyalties are split between those allied to the minister and others that support Defense Minister Salah al-Namroush. Both officials have sought to bolster military and security ties with Turkey.

Bashagha had said that the Geneva ceasefire deal was doomed to fail, describing it as ""fragile"". He said its success hinges on foreign countries ceasing their support to the LNA.

The UN Security Council on Tuesday ratified the ceasefire, calling on the LNA and GNA to ""implement the agreement in full,"" diplomats said.

The declaration is to be followed up soon by a UN resolution, diplomatic sources said, according to AFP.

""The members of the Security Council welcomed the permanent ceasefire agreement"" signed in Geneva under the aegis of the UN, and called on ""the Libyan parties to abide by their commitments.""

The Security Council also called on the two sides ""to show the same determination in reaching a political solution"" when they meet to discuss the issue further on November 9 in Tunisia, the declaration added.

It also cited the need for countries and parties to respect the arms embargo slapped on Libya in 2011 and to end any outside intervention in the country's internal affairs.

At least 52 migrants were killed and 87 others were injured in one of the deadliest incidents since the launch of the offensive on Tripoli in April 2019.

Head of the International Organization Cooperation & Emergency Aid (IOCEA) Jamal al-Mabrouk told Asharq Al-Awsat that several detention centers in Libya are carrying out flagrant violations, especially those located in militia-ruled areas.

Activists showed solidarity with Mabrouk and demanded the immediate closure of the centers.

UNSMIL stated that the attack on Tajoura a year ago ""underlines the urgent need to close down all migration detention centers in Libya and release migrants and asylum seekers, along with the provision of protection and assistance.""

""This is particularly urgent as Libya grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, with detained migrants and asylum seekers who are vulnerable and exposed, given the poor sanitation, health, and overcrowded conditions in detention centers,"" it added.

In its statement last week, UNSMIL said: ""Mandatory or indefinite detention in the context of migration is in itself arbitrary. Detention must be justified as reasonable, necessary and proportionate in the light of the circumstances and reassessed as it extends in time.""

According to the mission's public report on the airstrikes, the Tajoura attack, depending on the precise circumstances, may have amounted to a war crime. In addition, the failure to move detainees from the vicinity of a potential military objective or move military objects that were positioned next to the detention center, likely amounting to a violation of the obligation under international law to take all feasible measures to protect civilians under their control from the effects of potential attacks.

They revealed that regional and international efforts have failed to result in a ceasefire especially with ""the military ambition"" of GNA forces.

Given the current locations of the warring parties in Sirte, no agreement has yet been finalized regarding a permanent cessation of hostilities, according to the sources.

Turkish-backed GNA, led by Fayez al-Sarraj, wants to increase its presence in the city's vicinity, and also east of Sirte.

The LNA airforce continued its sorties in several areas near the city, and its artillery shelled a number of GNA sites and locations near Buerat el-Hussoun area, west of Sirte.

The tribal elders' council in southern Libya joined the demands for Haftar to have a say on oil, while the parliament's defense and national security committee warned against using oil revenues to fund the militias and mercenaries hired to kill Libyans.

However, head of the parliamentary energy committee Issa al-Uraibi revealed that the delay in oil exports was due to the GNA's reluctance to sign a ceasefire agreement.

Uraibi said in a statement that the committee is looking forward to resuming the exports given that parties adopt proper mechanisms that ensure fair distribution of oil revenues among all Libyans.

Meanwhile, Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Wednesday that force majeure continued on oil exports on Hariga, Brega, Zueitina, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports.

NOC issued instructions to all operating companies to prepare for resumption of operations on June 20, in light of ongoing negotiations between GNA and regional countries, under the supervision of the UN and the US.

According to media reports, Darmanin will discuss with the Tunisian side the repatriation of several Tunisians who are accused of extremism and who are illegal residents in France.

Following the murder of French middle-school instructor Samuel Paty last week for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class, the public called for sending extremists and terror suspects back to their home countries.

The visit will also discuss the third meeting of the Tunisian-French Higher Cooperation Council scheduled next March, in addition to continuing coordination in international and regional issues.

In a related context, New French Ambassador to Tunisia André Parant presented his letter of credentials to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Migration and Tunisians Abroad, Othman Jerandi.",Asharq Al-Awsat English,energy,,"['Tunisia', 'France', 'Libya', 'Beirut']","Tunisia, France Discuss Libya Crisis, Repatriation of Extremists",https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2579731/tunisia-france-discuss-libya-crisis-repatriation-extremists,None,

This crime of recruiting children has been documented on the ground after the Libyan Army captured a large number of children while others were killed after they were caught in the crossfire. Al-Monitor website published a report on Erdogan recruiting Syrian children and teenagers and deploying them alongside the Government of National Accord's militias.

The website revealed how the ages of these children and teenagers were falsified on their identity cards, and their dates and places of birth were altered, often using their older brothers' names to obscure the reality.

This crime was confirmed by US journalist Lindsey Snell who said, ""Turkey has recruited children no older than 14 years into the ranks of Syrian mercenaries and has deployed them to fight in the Libyan capital of Tripoli.""

It was also confirmed by Arab News newspaper, which confirmed that Erdogan recruited children to fight in Libya, taking advantage of the poverty that their families live in.

These children are specifically selected from camps using substantial financial incentives reaching 3,000 dollars per month with promises to remove them from refugee camps and providing them with a Turkish nationality and money, and to return the children three months later loaded with dollars. Instead, however, the reality of the war returns them unidentified in coffins to be buried in mass graves away from the spotlight.

Syrian children are victims of Erdogan's greed and delusions of taking over Libya and looting its riches. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that 16 out of 150 Syrian children between the ages of 14 and 18 were killed during the most recent battles after being deployed with 10,000 Syrian mercenaries who fought among the ranks of the ""political Islam"" militias in Tripoli, taking part in the displacement and armed robbery of people there.

Prosecuting those involved in recruiting mercenaries and children under the International Criminal Court Statute (ICC) would serve as a future deterrent against similar crimes. According to Article 8, ""Both the voluntary and forced recruitment of children"" in armed forces or groups in international and local conflicts is ""considered a war crime"". Prosecuting Erdogan and his partners for the conscription of children by the ICC is a national duty of the national forces in Syria and Libya.

Political opportunism, which is Erdogan's political method, has made him use mercenaries including children to achieve political and geopolitical goals and satisfy his expansionist tendencies to fulfil his delusion of a second Ottoman Empire and taking over the riches of the sea. These interests intersect with those of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Caliphate of the Murshid to loot Libyan money and turn it into a treasury for the Brotherhood to restore its rule in Egypt.

Deploying thousands of mercenaries, both children and men, in Libya is like throwing wood and fuel into the flames. It is not only a threat to the security and interests of Libya, but also of Europe. The presence of mercenaries not more than 300 miles across the sea south of Europe is a looming danger that is inevitably coming to Europeans even if they turned a blind eye to them.

11404326,2020-05-17,"A London court of appeals has ruled that the current board of directors of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) and the decisions of the Presidential Council of the Government of National Accord about LIA are legal.

LIA, the war-torn country's sovereign wealth fund, said in a statement on Friday that it would take measures to remove the judicial guardianship and to tackle the tasks and assets under its authority, in addition to finishing the legal representation procedures at state financial institutions.

It also said that the British court had rejected altogether the allegations of the parallel parties that claimed legitimacy to represent the LIA.

LIA called for lifting the judicial guardianship of assets so that it can operate with and develop those assets as per the laws and the current sanctions system.

The fund was first hit by an asset freeze in 2011, via a United Nations Security Council resolution and those restrictions remain in place on most of its assets outside Libya.

The investment fund has tried in the past to persuade the UN to change its sanctions, including in 2017. In November last year, Libya's foreign affairs minister Mohamed Siala outlined the problems the LIA faced because of sanctions, in comments to the UN Security Council. ""We hope that the council will take the measures necessary to address the negative consequences of the sanctions regime as soon as possible,"" he said.

While the majority of the LIA's funds are subject to the UN asset freeze, just how much is involved is a matter of speculation. The last proper evaluation of the LIA's portfolio was completed in 2012, a year after the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi was ousted from power. At the time, the LIA said it had $67bn in assets, most of which was in shares and bank deposits.

The US-based Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute now puts the LIA's assets at $60bn, but the LIA itself is not sure.

Last March, British Commercial Court ruled for recognition of Ali Mahmoud Hassan as the legal Director of LIA.",Asharq Al-Awsat English,energy,,"['London', 'Libya', 'United Kingdom']",London Court Says Libyan Investment Authority Board Is Legal,https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2288201/london-court-says-libyan-investment-authority-board-legal,None,
