11397924,2018-11-24,"Libya has three interrelated challenges, and these challenges are in the political, security and economic spheres, Libya's Minister of Planning Taher Jehami said.

Jehami was speaking on day two of the Rome 2018 Mediterranean Dialogues conference at the ""Enhancing Libya's Economy: The Complementary Path to Stabilization"" session.

It was a rare occasion where Libya's internationally-recognized Planning Minister was heard elaborating the country's economic policy.

""Whatever happens in the political sphere affects the other two"". The effect of the Palermo conference on Libya on the political situation ""will help the security and economic reforms"" that the Faiez Serraj regime is currently implementing, he added.

""Palermo may make the reunification of Libya's economic institutions, such as its Central Bank (CBL), much easier"".

The recently introduced economic reforms of the Tripoli-based Faiez Serraj Libyan government ""are only a start, but they need to be completed and need to become more comprehensive"", he explained.

""Already since their introduction in September, there have been positive results from Libya's economic reforms"".

These, Jehami explained, can be seen in four main ways: Firstly, the gap between the black-market and official foreign exchange rate has narrowed by about 20 percent.

Secondly, foreign currency is now more available to both businesses and the general public.

Thirdly, the liquidity crunch is receding, and it ""may disappear"" altogether ""in weeks"". And finally, ""prices are coming down"".

This is a good start for the economic reforms, insisted Jehami, but there is still the need for the introduction of fuel subsidy reform.

Fuel subsidies are are a drain on the country's finances, taking up 12 percent of the state budget. These could take between 18-24 months to introduce fully.

There are also hidden subsidies such as electricity tariffs that need reforming.

Jehami said that Libya needs to restructure its budget to be more productive and less consumptive.

Libya has made some cost savings such as the reduction of its diplomatic missions abroad (which ate paid in hard currency).

Jehami also confirmed that Libya no longer has a current account deficit. He also expects that the foreign exchange rate to ""stabilize"" to a level that both the CBL and private sector ""will be happy with"".

On Libya's stalled projects, he added that his government was working with the World Bank in assessing these projects. The implication is that some projects would be prioritized whilst others would be delayed or cancelled.

Jehami said that his government was also talking to the World Bank on how to spend its money, how to raise money, and how to get the private sector more involved in the economy.

Tripoli's Central Bank of Libya Governor Saddek El-Kaber insisted that there is only ""one Central Bank"" in Libya. He confirmed that the two CBL ""branches"" had agreed the terms of reference with the UN Security Council on auditing the two branches - which Faiez Serraj had requested.

However, El-Kaber said that he did not see the two CBL branches reuniting unless first, there is political reunification of the country.

CBL Board Member, Tarik Yousef (Magarief) said that Libya has come some way since 2017 when the distance in outlook and how to move forward between the CBL and the Faiez Serraj Presidency Council and Government of National Accord was wide.

He said that it was an important start and that the economic measures were long overdue.

Revealingly, he said that in his view, the secret to this success was the role of the international community - and specifically the U.S.A.

He said that Libya's institutional fragmentation was caused by its political fragmentation, but that the CBL had survived despite this political split.

He felt that the CBL was still effective and that these economic reforms were proof of that.

He hoped that the international community would shield Libya from further international interference in order to enable it to move forward.

Michael Schaffer, the World Bank's (WB) Representative in Libya revealed that the WB will open its office in Tripoli in the next few weeks.

He said that the WB will now play a more proactive role in Libya.

He explained that in 2018 the WB had succeeded in reunifying the country's budget structure and one payment authority. However, there was still expenditure outside the budget.

He explained that Libya's Ministry of Finance are trying to introduce better accountability and that the WB was helping with priority spending.

He said that it needs to impose fiscal rules to prevent overspending and needs to reintroduce financial controls for better transparency and accountability.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Palermo', 'Libya', 'Rome', 'Tripoli']",Libya's economic reforms have been successful,https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/11/24/libyas-economic-reforms-have-been-successful/,None,
11397925,2018-11-19,"The U.S. Treasury Department has today officially listed Salah Badi, the Libya Dawn and Somoud militia commander, on its sanctions list.

The move comes after the UK announced on Friday that Badi had been added to the UN Sanctions list.

In its Friday statement the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had said:

""The UK - along with our US & French partners - has secured United Nations Security Council agreement to sanction Salah Badi under the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 2213 (2015). We will continue to hold to account those seeking to undermine stability and security in Libya.

Salah Badi is the senior commander of the Al Somood Brigade, a militia opposed to the UN-recognised Government of National Accord. He has worked consistently to undermine a political solution in Libya. In August and September 2018, Salah Badi played a leading role in heavy clashes in Tripoli in which at least 120 people were killed, most of whom were civilians.

This designation will subject Salah Badi to a travel ban and asset freeze, thereby sending a clear message from the international community that acts of violence against the Libyan people will not be tolerated. The UK will not allow those seeking to obstruct peace and stability in Libya to act with impunity.""

The move on Badi by the international community came after reports last week that Badi had led a militia attack on the Gaser Benghashir area in the south of Tripoli and Tripoli's old airport.

The move comes as part of a new policy by UNSMIL and the international community to single out Libyan ""spoilers"" of peace and stability.

It is also part of its efforts to maintain the Zawia ceasefire agreement that ended the South Tripoli militia fighting that broke out in August/September this year.

Following that ceasefire agreement the Serraj government is attempting to impose a new ""Security Arrangement"" in the capital. This entails regular non-militia security forces taking over security operations at more state institutions.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['United States', 'Libya', 'United Kingdom', 'Tripoli', 'France', 'Zawiya, Libya']",U.S. lists Salah Badi on its sanctions list,https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/11/19/u-s-lists-salah-badi-on-its-sanctions-list/,None,
11397926,2018-11-15,"The head of Libya's Presidential Council, Faiez Serraj, yesterday visited the graves of Libyans exiled to the small Italian island of Ustica, off Sicily, during the era of Italian colonisation of Libya.

Serraj had taken advantage of his presence in the Sicilian city of Palermo in southern Italy where he had attended the international conference on Libya held on 12-13 November.

Serraj visited the island's cemetery where 132 Libyan exiles were buried, laying a wreath at a plaque commemorating their memory, and reading from the Koran to call for mercy on their souls.

Serraj told Libyan media that the Libyan victims of the Italian colonial era will remain in the Libyan national memory.

He had added that what had happened during that period was a painful era in the history of the Libyan people, and many Libyans had gone through such tribulations, which were lessons that supported and entrenched the aspirations of peoples to live in a world of peace and security.

The island of Ustica has a population of 1,300 people and is about 5 kilometres across, 52 kilometres north off the main island of Sicily in the Tyrrhenian Sea.

It is estimated that about 5,000 to 6,000 Libyans were exiled by colonial Italy to various prisons in Italy between 1911 and 1943.

The head of Libya's House of Representatives (HoR), Ageela Saleh, concluded his official visit to the Italian capital Rome at the invitation of the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.

The official spokesperson of the HoR, Abdulla Belheeg, said that during his Rome visit Saleh met with Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Milanese and discussed with him the latest political developments and the situation in Libya and ways to reach a solution to end the current crisis in Libya ahead of the Palermo conference on Libya.

11397928,2018-11-01,"The head of Libya's internationally recognised Presidency Council, Faiez Serraj, called on the Security Council's Sanctions Committee to partially lift its arms embargo and the freezing of Libya's funds abroad.

Serraj made the call during his meeting with the UN Sanctions Committee his office in Tripoli today.

Serraj welcomed the Committee's visit to Libya stressing the importance of such meetings in exchanging views and in identifying the reality of the economic, political and security conditions that Libya is experiencing at this sensitive stage and what Libyan citizens are suffering as a result of these conditions.

Serraj stressed the importance of a comprehensive review of the UN sanctions imposed on Libya and of the viability of their continuation.

He stated that the UN sanctions have become an impediment to the progress of the economy and the start of the development process.

Serraj requested that the UN Sanctions Committee considered the possibility of allowing Libya to manage its frozen funds abroad rather than lifting the freeze on them.

He said that this would allow his internationally-recognized Government of National Accord to fulfil its obligations in providing services to its citizens and to make its economic reform programme a success.

With regards to the issue of security within Libya, Serraj highlighted the security arrangements that have been put in place in Tripoli, which are scheduled to be extended to other cities, and called for a partial lifting of the arms embargo in support of these efforts, in addition to combating terrorism and illegal immigration.

Serraj, without mentioning Khalifa Hafter by name, explained to the Sanctions Committee that there were those in Libya who were provided with arms and money illegally, while restrictions were being imposed on his legitimate government of Libya.

He pointed to the reports of the Sanctions Committee as a testament to all the sanctions violations in recent years.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli']",Serraj calls on UN Sanctions Committee to partially lift Libya arms embargo and asset freeze,https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/11/01/serraj-calls-on-un-sanctions-committee-to-partially-lift-libya-arms-embargo-and-asset-freeze/,None,
11397929,2018-10-23,"The personal spokesperson for Faiez Serraj, the head of Libya's internationally-recognized Presidential Council, Mohamed El-Sallak, confirmed Serraj's full support for the unification of Libya's military institution, and his continuous follow-up of this important negotiating process with the Government of National Accord-aligned army officers.

El-Sallak was speaking during Monday's press conference held at the Media Center of the Prime Minister's office in Tripoli.

He also spoke about the latest security arrangements, economic reform, a cabinet reshuffle and the Palermo Libya conference planned by Italy next month.

El-Sallak had failed to hold a press conference for weeks, most notably during the south Tripoli militia fighting.

Sallak said that Serraj stressed the emphasis on reaching a final agreement on the unification of Libya's military, which requires clarification of the status of the civil authority represented by the Supreme Commander of the Army and its powers. Serraj is currently the Supreme Commander of the Tripoli-based Libyan Army.

Sallak said that negotiations were still ongoing until a final agreement is reached, stressing that the matter of the unification of institutions, especially sovereign ones, is inseparable from a comprehensive Libyan political solution.

While not mentioning him by name, Sallak was reacting to comments by Khalifa Hafter's own spokesperson, Ahmed Mesmari, who had briefed about considerable progress being made at the Cairo Libyan army reunification talks.

Mesmari had implied that it was agreed at the talks that Hafter and his mainly eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) would be the main ""facade"" of the new unified army.

Sallak was keen to downplay these Mesmari statements, implying that these were simply renegotiating positions - until a comprehensive final agreement is reached.

Serraj was sending a clear message to the LNA and it's commander Khalifa Hafter that any new unified national Libyan army must be democratically accountable under a civilian executive.

A 4,000-word document proporting to be a secret draft of what was agreed in the Cairo meetings was leaked yesterday. It contained huge details, including a main role for Hafter and his LNA in the new unified army. This still, however, does not prove that it was agreed upon by both parties.

Security Arrangements

With regard to the ""Security Arrangements"", Sallak confirmed the completion of the final security arrangements plan and its entry into force in consultation and coordination with all parties.

Sallak was referring to the security arrangements agreed after the Zawia ceasefire agreement between the warring militias in south Tripoli at the end of August and early September this year.

The ""security arrangements"" refers to the terms of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) signed in the Moroccan city of Skhirat in December 2015 (LPA) whereby militias are suposed to remove their heavy weapons from urban centres. They also have the option of joining a non-militia-based accountable police or army.

There have been reports of a number of meetings between the Faiez Serraj authorities UNSMIL and militia leaders in which they have allegedly agreed to some sort of reform.

These include vacating their bases and handing over the security operations at a number of state locations.

It's not clear how inclusive these militia meetings were and how far militias have agreed to being totally decommissioned.

Economic reform

With regard to economic reforms, El-Sallak said that the Presidential Council is following up on the implementation of the economic reforms approved in coordination with the Tripoli-based Central Bank of Libya.

These include reforming the process of opening documentary letters of credit at the official exchange rate, the performance of commercial banks in facilitating the sale of foreign currency at the new exchange rate and their application of new procedures.

El-Sallak pointed out that the coming period will see the treatment of the issue of fuel subsidies to complement the implementation of the package of measures to reduce the burden on the national economy and combat smuggling.

Ministerial reshuffle

With regards to the political dossier, El-Sallak revealed tha Serraj will continue what he referred to as his ""political reforms"" through a forthcoming ministerial reshuffle, in order to complement the earlier ministerial changes.

It will be recalled that Serraj had announced a ministerial reshuffle on 7 October, appointing two new controversial ministers at Interior and Economy.

The House of Representatives (HoR) had condemned the appointment of new Economy Minister Issawi, who has been implicated in the assassination of the commander of the anti-Qaddafi forces during the 2011 Libyan revolution, Abdelfatah Younis.

It will also be recalled that the HoR and the High State Council (HSC) have recently reached an agreement on the mechanism for restructuring the Serraj-led Presidency Council (PC).

When asked by journalists to comment about the HoR-HSC plan to restructure the PC, El-Sallak declined, adding that he recognized their authority under the terms of the LPA to restructure the PC and that the PC will continue to work normally in the meanwhile.

Most Libya analysts expect Serraj to be replaced in the jew slimline 3-member Presidency Council. Serraj's ministerial reshuffle is seen as an attempt to delay or cancel this planned restructuring.

Libya November Palermo conference

With regards to the Palermo Libya Conference planned for November, El-Sallak confirmed that Serraj had received an official invitation from his Italian counterpart to attend the conference.

El-Sallak said that Serraj was committed to the need to produce concrete, positive results, translated into practical steps on the ground leading to a comprehensive political settlement to resolving the Libyan crisis.

Replying to questions from journalists regarding the demolition of the Tripoli Girl's Military Academy compound, Sallak claimed that the decision to demolish it was done ""in coordination with Tripoli Municipality"".

The former Girl's Military Academy is located in a prime downtown Tripoli location overlooking the Mediterranean sea. Since the 2011 revolution it has been used as a militia base.

Whilst Tripoli residents were pleased that the Nawasi militia had vacated it, they were puzzled by why all the buildings within it, estimated to be worth millions, were being demolished without any public debate.

However, when pressed by journalists and informed that Tripoli Municipality had claimed that they had demolished the buildings at the site on instructions from the Serraj PC, Sallak said that he would check and get back to the media on the matter.

Mysteriously, El-Sallak failed to make any comment whatsoever on the recent Tripoli militia assassinations nor the insecurity in the south of Libya.

11397930,2018-09-18,"Faiez Serraj, head of the Presidential Council and Government of National Accord, met with the heads of (reportedly) more than 50 western-based municipal and local councils in an open dialogue on the general situation and the repercussions of the bloody clashes in the southern suburbs of Tripoli over the last month.

After opening the meeting with a minute's silence in mourning for the victims of the armed militia clashes and the recent terrorist attack on the Tripoli headquarters of the National Oil Corporation, Serraj delivered a speech in which he reviewed the measures taken in coordination with UNSMIL for the south Tripoli ceasefire and in initiating new Tripoli security measures (the Security Arrangements).

Serraj said that these new security measures would not be limited to Tripoli but would extend to other cities too.

Speaking in a rarely seen animated and tough tone, Serraj stressed that the issue is not just clashes between armed elements (militias), but even more so there are parties in the background who direct the elements on the ground and work in all ways and by all means to bring down the (Skhirat Libyan Political Agreement) consensus and now work ""to ignite a war in the capital which we will never allow"".

Serraj warned that whoever violates the ceasefire agreement ""will face a critical response both domestically and internationally"". However, as per usual, he gave no specifics.

Serraj stressed that things will not continue as they had in the past and that what happened to the capital (the militia fighting) is a dividing line (in the sand) between what preceded and what follows.

Referring to the outcomes of the May Paris meeting, including the holding of elections on a sound constitutional basis at the end of December this year, ending the transitional stages of its current institutions, provided that the House of Representatives (HoR) had submited the referendum law on the permanent constitutional by September 16 - Serraj said that so far the HoR had not kept to the Paris agreement.

The HoR also failed, Serraj added, to implement the other outcomes of the Paris agreement such the gradual dissolution of parallel bodies and the creation of the (right) atmosphere and non-escalation. Serraj added that ""some"" (in effective political positions) insist on keeping the status quo in fear of losing their positions and privileges.

On the economic situation, Serraj Said that he had hoped that the Central Bank of Libya would have been united in order to agree on a single monetary policy, and that he had tried to achieve such unity, but that the suffering of Libyan citizens no longer allowed for the luxury of waiting.

As a result, he said that he took the responsibility and issued a decision to launch the economic reforms after he had given up on the response of the HoR which was divided.

On the allegations of financial irregularities in the Central Bank of Libya and his government, Serraj said he had taken the initiative and officially asked the UN Security Council to form an international committee under the supervision of the United Nations to inspect the dealings of the Central Bank of Libya in Tripoli and Beida and other parallel bodies and to clarify the reality of the financial situation in the country as a whole.

Serraj stressed that he would not stand helpless before the bureaucracy and obstructers and that his administration will take the necessary decisions that will bring the country out of the current crisis for good, stressing that what is coming next will be decisive and will be better.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Skhirat', 'Paris', 'Libya']",Serraj talks tough on security - but can he back it up?,https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/09/18/serraj-talks-tough-on-security-but-can-he-back-it-up/,None,
11397931,2018-09-06,"Ghassan Salame, SRSG and UNSMIL head, talked tough yesterday during his latest Libya

brief to the UN Security Council. Using language and frankness not heard from him before, he called out Libya's militias, HoR and HSC members.

Salame admitted that what has existed in Tripoli was merely a ''façade of calm'' and that the capital ''stood on brink of all-out war''. He said that UNSMIL will not allow the militias to repeat their 2014 military actions against the capital nor will it allow a return to the militia/security ''status quo ante''. He also admitted that Libya has been lurching from ''one emergency to another''.

The UNSMIL head also admitted that the ''previous arrangements empowered'' militias. However, he felt that the latest militia crisis may offer an opportunity to tackle the ''real causes'' of the latest militia fighting and to ''reduce the influence of armed groups'' that have been legitimized, and enshrined and appeased by the Libyan political process since 2011.

He warned that ISIL presence and operations in Libya were spreading and called for the urgent implementation of the Libya's promised economic reforms.

But Salame saved his strongest remarks for the House of Representatives (HoR) and High State (HSC) Council. He said that the HoR was resisting change and failing to do its job, and together with the HSC, were attempting to ''ensure their longevity''. He warned, however, that Libya's political elite could be by-passed in the political process.

He also took a swipe at the international community, widely considered to be France and Italy, for their politicking and called on them to unify their positions on Libya.

I would like to congratulate the United States of America on its presidency of the Council this month and thank you for this opportunity to update the Council.

Mr President, Members of the Council

In each and every briefing I have given to this Council, I have stated that the status quo in Libya is untenable.

The violence that consumed the Capital beginning 26 August shattered the façade of calm that had prevailed in Tripoli since May 2017.

Tanks and heavy artillery were deployed into residential neighborhoods. 61 Libyans were killed and 159 injured. Many of those who died were civilians, including children. Families were forced to flee their homes. Looting and crime became common place as gangs took to the streets. Hundreds of criminals broke out of prison. Migrants were either trapped in detention centers, or turned onto the street.

The City stood on the brink of all-out war.

On 4 September, the Mission brokered a ceasefire between the major parties to the conflict. This has effectively halted the fighting and started the restoration of some order to the city.

The Mission is now working to protect this fragile peace and enable it to take root. As a first step, we are offering technical assistance and good offices in support of the ceasefire.

Groups that violate the ceasefire must be held to account. The United Nations and the international community are watching them one by one. The time for impunity is behind us.

This outbreak of violence is but the latest in a series of crises that have engulfed Libya. The events surrounding the Oil Crescent region in June and July effectively threatened to split the country. In the past short weeks, the nation has lurched from one emergency to another.

On 10 August, armed groups forcibly evicted displaced Tawerghan families from the Tariq al-Matar IDP Camp. Some Tawerghans were killed and injured, homes were demolished and these Libyans were forced to flee, leaving them homeless for a second time in seven years. Despite the welcome return of several more families to Tawergha, totaling approximately 100 families at the end of August, basic infrastructure and services are still lacking, making a dignified return very difficult. We warned all armed groups against any repetition of this totally unlawful behavior. Forced displacement of people is unacceptable, and of those already displaced, doubly so. This was made clear to all those tempted by it.

After the horrendous attack on the High National Elections Commission of 2 May, on 23 August, ISIL claimed responsibility for an attack near Zliten, which claimed the lives of four police officers. ISIL presence and operations in Libya are only spreading. I alert this Council of the possibility that Libya may become a shelter for terrorist groups of all persuasions and ask the Council to help address with this looming threat.

In recent weeks, Chadian Government and Chadian opposition forces have been fighting, operating from Southern Libya. Over 1,000 fighters have been involved in the hostilities, risking the South becoming a regional battle ground and safe haven for foreign armed groups, including terrorist organizations. The recent Agreement signed between Chad, Sudan, Niger and Libya needs to be implemented so Libya does not also become an alternative battleground for others. The signatories have asked for support from the International Community for the implementation of these agreements, and I hope that Council members will positively consider their request.

In the Eastern city of Derna, sporadic clashes and air raids continue. The UN is facilitating humanitarian assistance to affected families in the city. I reiterate my call upon all parties to exercise restraint and protect the lives of innocent civilians.

Abuse and exploitation abound within prisons and detention centers, which we continue to have great difficulty accessing, both in the East and West. Refugees and asylum seekers in detention centres have resorted to hunger strikes as a means to resolve their bleak living circumstances.

This situation should however not be used as an excuse for any armed group to open the gates to terrorists and criminals interned in one location, to displace them to other locations.

All the while, the citizens of the country suffer deteriorating standards of living, as they have for the last years. Now, for many, every day is a personal emergency.

In crisis, lies the opportunity to tackle the underlying causes.

To restore stability to Libya, there is an urgent need to establish strong and unified civilian and military institutions, which work for the benefit of all citizens.

The Mission is now focusing its work in two intertwined areas:

First, and in order to underpin the ceasefire, we are working to revise the security arrangements in Tripoli in order to reduce the influence of groups who use arms to achieve their parochial goals.

In the coming days UNSMIL will continue to hold broad consultations to strengthen the ceasefire and assist in the establishment of a monitoring mechanism. At the same time, we will continue to work with our Libyan counterparts to identify concrete steps towards reshaping security in the Capital and develop more sustainable arrangements.

UNSMIL will endeavour to facilitate this effort in an inclusive and pragmatic fashion, laying the foundations for longer term efforts to stabilize the country, through the reunification of the security sector institutions.

The previous security configuration empowered groups who acted in a predatory manner against the residents of the capital, against the state, and against sovereign institutions.

Indeed, members of some armed groups nominally acting under the Ministry of Interior have kidnapped, tortured and murdered employees of sovereign institutions, including the National Oil Corporation and the Libyan Investment Authority.

Our public criticism of the predatory behavior of armed groups in the capital was warmly welcomed by Libyans, who are fed up with living on the poverty line whilst their national resources are looted by gunmen-turned-millionaires. Our stand has produced a salutary impact in many cases. This state capture must end, but not to benefit of other armed groups, but to the full control of the legitimate authorities. Your support on this is crucial.

Mr President,

The Mission's second priority is to address the economic issues which underpin the crisis and erode the daily lives of citizens across the country. I would like to state plainly that if an end is not put to the plundering, there is little chance that we can move either the economic reforms or the political process.

We urge action on the agreed upon economic reforms which are essential, and overdue. I call upon the Central Bank of Libya and the Government of National Accord to immediately move forward on currency exchange rate and subsidy reforms.

We are also committed to advocating for a more equitable distribution of wealth in Libya, focused not on appeasing groups based on their military strength, but on providing for citizens based on their need.

UNSMIL believes that the request from Prime Minister Fayez Serraj for international support for a financial review is a valuable opportunity to bring transparency and accountability to how the country's wealth is managed.

In response to the Security Council's request of 19 July to the Mission to provide suggestions on the modalities of such a review, I have been engaged with Libyan and international partners.

I convened the Governor of the internationally-recognised Central Bank of Libya in Tripoli and the head of the parallel Central Bank in the East for a meeting at the UNSMIL office to agree on the broad parameters of the review. On 24 August, the Secretary-General submitted to this Council my proposals for how to proceed.

This preliminary process has created hope, with many Libyans welcoming the meeting of the two officials, something that has not happened in the past four years. This was a first step towards unifying the Central Bank, which in turn is a crucial step towards unifying the country.

Mr President, Members of the Council,

When the political process grinds to a halt, some will believe there is opportunity to force change through the barrel of a gun.

The Libyan public has made a clear decision on how this change should come to pass - peacefully and democratically through elections. This was widely reflected during the National Conference consultations - a report on which is currently being prepared.

It should come as no surprise that the Libyans want change in their political leadership. The members of the House of Representatives were elected over four years ago by around fifteen percent of the population. The members of the High Council of State, which represents a fraction of the members of the General National Congress, were elected six years ago. The Government of National Accord assumed their roles not through elections, but by appointment, and many of them have been inactive for a long while.

For National elections to take place a number of conditions must be met. They will require great effort to achieve; but they are achievable. The United Nations is working hard to put these conditions in place, and thanks the international community for its support.

Time and time again, the House of Representatives has promised to produce referendum and election legislation. After three sessions dedicated to the referendum law, and numerous delays, the House of Representatives has failed to deliver this legislation. Those who have an interest in maintaining the status quo have spared no efforts to resist the needed change.

I will not mince words. Many members of the House of Representatives are failing to do their job. They seek to subvert the political process to their own ends, behind the guise of procedure. It is clear; they simply have no intention of relinquishing their positions. They have put in place legal provisions to maintain their authority in perpetuity.

And for the personal ambitions of a few, all Libya's citizens have paid a steep price.

I welcome any rapprochement between the two Houses and take note of their recent meetings in Tripoli, but this activity must be directed to advance the political process, not to ensure their own longevity.

In line with instructions from the United Nations Secretary-General, I have been exhausting the traditional avenues to move the legislative process forward. So far, they have either been blocked or they are designed to lead nowhere.

If legislation is not produced soon, we will close the chapter on this approach. There are other ways to achieve peaceful political change, and we will embrace them with no hesitation, indeed with enthusiasm.

Mr President, Members of the Council

11397932,2018-07-19,"Head of Libya's Presidency Council, Faiez Serraj, called on the international community to present a unified stance towards Libya, to push for early elections and to push the House of Representatives to stop obstructing the political process.

Speaking in Tunis yesterday, Serraj presented what he saw as his demands for resolving Libya's current political crisis at a meeting with ambassadors of the major powers, the UN envoy and the EU representative.

These included ambassadors and representatives of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, China, the UN envoy and the EU representative.

Serraj presented his requirements for resolving the Libyan crisis and the pivotal role of the major powers in stabilizing Libya, which he said was essential for the stability of the region and the world.

Serraj gave a brief account of the political, security and economic outlines of the Libyan crisis and the political and institutional division of the country, which have adversely affected the livelihood of the citizens.

He also summarised the efforts that have been made to reach reconciliation in Libya, saying that, ""Whenever we step towards reconciliation we find a way backwards "". He noted how the Paris conference in May this year had been the latest attempt at consensus, with divergent international positions, saying that some of those attending the conference had exploited that disparity to sift through its decisions and renege on their commitments. He pointed out that there were also serious breaches of what was agreed in Paris, as was the case in the recent oil ports (the handing over of the eastern oil ports by Hafter and his LNA to the NOC in eastern Libya).

Serraj said that the political divide in Libya would not have continued if the obstructionists found a decisive, resolute and unified international stance. He added that negative interventions from regional and international states were extending the life of Libya's current situation, where the spoilers relied on the contradiction of international positions, noting that there were states that are biased in favour of some parties to the conflict, and some even provide arms to some of those parties - despite embargoes.

He reiterated that a resolute and unified international stance was required to cut-off the road to the divisive scenario.

Serraj said that patience was beginning to wear thin in Libya towards the inaction of the international community, which had lost much of its credibility on the Libyan street, often deliberately pursuing a policy of double standards.

Serraj went on to reiterate the need for parliamentary and presidential elections to be held concurrently and as soon as possible, with an emphasis on the establishment of a valid and expeditious constitutional rule. He also said that now was the time to think of ""out of the box"" solutions to end the continuing and growing obstruction by the Tobruk-based House of Representatives.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Libya', 'Paris', 'Tunis', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom', 'France', 'Germany', 'China']",Serraj calls for a unified Libya stance by international community,https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/07/19/serraj-calls-for-a-unified-libya-stance-by-international-community/,None,

He had been criticised for failing to comment on the incident which had led Majbari to temporarily seek sanctuary in Tunis.

Majbari, who represents the eastern region of Libya in the PC, had claimed that there was an attempt to kidnap or assassinate him in Tripoli as a result of his support for Khalifa Hafter and the Libyan National Army (LNA).

Majbari has spoken up for Hafter and the LNA for their role in initially ejecting Ibrahim Jadran from the eastern oil crescent and for his recent re-ejection too. Majabari felt that the anti-Hafter wing have not acknowledged Hafter's role in Libya's increased oil production of up to one million barrels per day since Jadran was ejected from the oil crescent.

At Tuesday's weekly press conference, Serraj's official spokesperson, Mohamed El-Sallak said that Serraj ''categorically rejected such acts and offered his total condemnation of the attack and what disruption it had caused to the (political and security) scene and damage to the reconciliation path.

Sallak stressed Serraj's ''keenness on the security and safety of Al-Majbari and his companions, and the members of the Presidential Council and the entire Government of National Accord and their need to exercise their work unhindered''.

11398061,2018-11-20,"With overt enthusiasm, Libyans openly celebrated Prophet Mohamed's birthday (the Mawlid al-Nabawi or Miloud) this year, reinvigorating life into an old traditional practice recently prosecuted, silenced and perceived as un-Islamic by some Islamic interpretations.

The Sufi turuqs (orders) have been an integral part and in the forefront of mainstream Islamic traditions in Libya for centuries.

Indeed, long before they were labled as Sufis or traditional Malikies, the Islamic Sufi school has taken pride in overtly celebrating the Prophet's birthday.

Mawlid organizing Majalis have been composing religious poetry (hymns) and performing various types of ceremonial rituals, including, food and gift hand-outs to children and the poor.

""As for the Sufi turuqs and Shaykhs, we are ready to celebrate the Mawlid. In addition to civil societies who insist on taking part in the event"". head of the honourable Ashraf (Ahlul Bayt) the descendants of the Prophet) syndicate and head of the Supreme Council of Sufi turuqs in Libya, Ezzideen Al-Shaikhi, told the Libya Herald earlier this week.

""We have coordinated with the security authorities to protect the celebrators and the marching"" adds Al-Shaikhi.

This comes on the back of an anti Maulid movement after the 2011 Libyan revolution by non-state militias and religious movements.

Starting in early 2012 Sufi shrines, tombs and libraries were constantly attacked and demolished, and Shaykhs were assassinated and hounded.

The Abdulsalam Al-Asmar Al-Feitouri shrine and Quranic Zawiya in Zliten, 147 Kilometres east of Tripoli, was attacked in August 2012 by a Salafist group.

The shrine was blown up, partly demolishing the Zawia, vandalizing the grave and burning down the library, including 700-year old manuscripts, which tUNESCO's Director-General Irina Bokova condemned at the time.

However, this year, Sufis were ready to openly celebrate the Mawlid and revive a long-craved traditions, with preparations for the day in both eastern and western Libya.

On 8 November, the predominantly Salafists Ministry of Awqaf (religious endowment) and Islamic Affairs in the Beida-based government of Abdullah Thinni issued a statement urging mosque Imams to speak up against the Mawlid celebrations, projecting it as a sheer ""Beda"" or heresy.

However, this attracted much criticism and ridicule by Libyans on social media. ""We are sorry to hear these accusations of Shirk and heresy from the Awqaf and Islamic Affairs. We demand the Interim Government put a stop to them speaking of such dangerous accusations"", said Al-Shaikhi.

It will be recalled that the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) Chief of Staff Abdulrazig Alnaduri gave his permission for the reopening of the Sufi Zawias and schools in April this year.

""We asked the Maj-General Alnaduri for the reopening of the Zawias. He agreed, but the Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Authority opposed the decision and said they are to house the internally displaced in these Zawias instead"" said Al-Shaikhi.

""They came with heavily armed vehicles to prevent the reopening and threatened to use violence. We went back to Alnaduri who finally issued another decree that separates the Zawias from the Awqaf and attaching it to the Ashraf Syndicate"", said Al-Shaikhi.

The Hounrable Ashraf Syndicate was founded on 22 June 2016 in Shahat (Cyrene) in eastern Libya.

Sufis and Salafists have had well-documented standoffs in post-2011 Libya.

In November last year preparations for the Mawlid event at one of Tripoli's oldest Sufi centers and Zawia of the Shaikha Radiya mosque was preemptively thwarted at dawn by unknown assailants.

Widely believed to have been carried out by a Salafist group, they burned down the mosque and its small Quranic school.

Meanwhile, the more miitant Salafist ""Mudkhalists"" gained a greater role and managed to take control of eastern Libya's religious authorities and secured a strong footing within the LNA coalition.

They labelled different Sunni schools as ""strayed"" sects, grave worshippers and ""Kharijites"". In the case of the Ibadi branch of Muslims, the form of Islam followed largely by Libya's Amazigh community, the attack sparked nationwide fury and condemnation in July 2017.

""As for other Islamic trends and schools, like Ibadis, we consider them brothers as we are all Muslims. We hold nothing but love and gratitude for them. We are indeed in contact, as we preach peace and love and equally condemn violence and blood and respect different understandings of Islam"", Al-Shaikhi added.

There are several Sufi turuqs (orders) in Libya, most notably ""Al-Essawiya, Al-Qaderiya, Al-Tijaniya, Al-Zarrouqiya, Al-Rifa'iya, Al-Khaliliya and the Al-Derqawiya"" states Al-Shaikhi. These sub-schools of turuqs are accredited to Sufi Shaykhs. Unlike Mudkhalis, Sufis are perceived as a non-violent Islamic trend both in historic and modern accounts. Although Jihad philosophy has been a core obligation, mostly devoted to self-defence and directed against colonialists.

11398276,2018-11-09,"In his latest brief on Libya to the UN Security Council yesterday, SRSG and UNSMIL head, Ghassan Salame, officially abandoned any attempt to hold Libyan elections in December this year. This was the target set in last May's Paris conference on Libya. Salame now predicted Libyan elections will be held in Spring 2019.

Salame came across as lukewarm regarding the effort by the House of Representatives (HoR) and the High State Council (HSC) to restructure the Faiez Serraj-led Presidency Council.

He was highly critical of the two bodies, who he said were delaying elections. He called the HoR sterile and accused it of wasting time and failing to ùphold its responsibilities.

Consequently, he announced that the National Conference (Multaqa) will convene in early 2019 which he said has a wider make up and provides a more representative view of the Libyan people. He hoped it would pressure the HoR and HSC into more progressive action.

Salame reiterated that Libya's conflict is partly over resources and commended the PC's economic reforms. These had reduced the black-market exchange rate, prices and the liquidity crisis. He anticipated that fuel subsidies would be phased in soon to counter smuggling.

On Tripoli's new Security Arrangements introduced after the south Tripoli militia fighting, Salame confirmed that some militias were abandoning state institutions to be taken over by regular forces and that security had improved. He hoped if successful, this model could be replicated across Libya.

Salame noted that the UNSC sanctions against militias had had a tangible effect on their behaviour. He asked the international community to help train Libya's regular security forces and asked them to take a unified policy stance on the country.

Here is the complete text of Salame's presentation to the UNSC:

Since my last briefing in early September, the violence in Tripoli finally ended. In the one month of fighting, over 120 lives were lost, including those of 34 women and children.

As a result of the ceasefire agreements brokered by UNSMIL, the parties agreed to stop the violence. On 25 September, most of the attackers from outside the city withdrew.

Since then, we have sought to transform a challenge into an opportunity. We have dedicated ourselves to the consolidation of the ceasefire - on the ground and at a political level - to minimise the prospect of similar crisis. The new Security Arrangements Committee for Greater Tripoli crafted a comprehensive security plan for the capital which has received the endorsement of the Presidential Council. Armed Groups elements will withdraw from key installations and official buildings, while reserve forces will be deployed on the edge of the city. A Joint Operations Centre has been working well to coordinate this process forwards.

Implementation has indeed started. Several armed groups have withdrawn from positions in Ministries and have indicated a readiness to hand over the port and the civilian terminal of Mitiga airport to state control. There is a fragile but palpable sense of improvement across the capital.

The concept we have been working on is clear and balanced. While armed groups from outside the city should not attempt to invade it again, armed groups operating within the city must stop using their position to penetrate, intimidate or control the sovereign institutions. Looking forward, the city should be protected by disciplined, regular police forces

Success in the Capital is crucial, not only because it houses most of the government institutions and 30 percent of the Libyan population, but also since what works in Tripoli can be a model to be repeated in other cities across the country.

Amongst the drivers of conflict is the appalling conditions in the prisons. Hundreds of Libyans and foreigners are illegally and inhumanly detained, and used to extract ransoms. Some prisons have turned into incubators for extremist ideology and terrorist groups. While the crisis prompted the issuance of a decree ordering the judiciary to review the files of the thousands of prisoners who have been languishing in jail, only 255 have been released. This process needs to be expedited and the armed groups must return control of detention facilities to the authorities. Prisons which have effectively become for-profit private enterprises operated by armed groups under state cover should be immediately shuttered. The Mission has established a special taskforce on prison reform.

Mr. President,

The unity of this Council in its support to our efforts to broker the ceasefire was invaluable. The threat and application of sanctions to those involved in violent or criminal action appears to have had a tangible effect in altering the behaviour of many armed actors.

Impunity must end. The phenomenon of armed men assaulting medical facilities and personnel, extorting money from financial institutions and women waiting in line for banking services is immoral, illegal and criminal. This must cease immediately. This was my message Tuesday, when I visited Jalaa Hospital for Women and Childbirth to express the UN's solidarity with the staff, after these health workers were assaulted by members of an armed gang.

The appointment of a new Minister of Interior signalled a decision to seriously engage on security in a robust and more determined manner. I am pleased to report that the Minister's first decree was to establish a human rights unit within the Ministry.

There is now a window of opportunity to address the tremendous challenges Libyan security institutions have faced since 2011, and UNSMIL has seized it.

The forthcoming conference on Libya to be hosted by the Government of Italy in Palermo is an occasion for Member States to offer tangible support to the training of professional security forces. I thank the Member States who have already offered assistance. Libyans should be helped to turn the page of their reliance on armed groups for their protection.

In the medium term, we also should contribute to unify and restructure a professional, national army and contribute to the Egyptian-led process.

Mr. President,

The violence in September reflects the underlying fragility in the country. The Libyan conflict is in large part a conflict over resources, and until this is resolved, stability will remain elusive.

Libya is wealthy. Oil production reaches up to 1.3 million barrels of oil per day, and this country of 6.5 million people has seen revenues of over 13 billion dollars in just this first half of the year. However, these figures obfuscate the truth; Libyans have been increasingly impoverished while criminals employ violence and patronage network to steal billions from the national coffers.

Ironically, the violence in Tripoli offered a unique opportunity to introduce long-awaited and much-needed economic reforms. On 12 of September, a range of economic measures were launched in order to improve the living conditions of the Libyan people and reduce the opportunities for militias in the shadow economy.

The imposition of fees on foreign currency transactions caused an almost twenty-five per cent drop in the black-market exchange rate. Closing the gap between the official and black-market rate reduces the margin for exploitation. Prices have dropped for basic goods - sugar, bread, school supplies and second-hand cars.

Many of the long-standing concerns have been mitigated, with the liquidity crisis receding, and the queues outside banks shrinking. Where there used to be deficits, the public coffers are now in surplus.

This was only the first step.

More must be done to further normalize the situation, and prevent the gains being rolled back. The phasing out of fuel subsidies for direct cash transfers will increase the real income of poor families, while preventing billions of Dinars from falling into the hands of smugglers.

One of the country's underlying dysfunctionalities is the division of its main financial institutions.

To promote reunification and financial accountability, UNSMIL proceeded with the request made by the Presidential Council to this Council, to your council, on 10 July 2018 for a financial review of the Central Bank and its parallel branch in the East. Yesterday, I hosted the second meeting between Governor Kabeer and deputy Governor Hebri, where an agreement was reached on the terms of reference for the exercise and the way ahead.

Here too, the upcoming Palermo conference could provide an opportunity to gain more practical support to establish a system for redistribution of national wealth, not to the benefit of overnight millionaires, but for the whole population.

Mr. President,

Security and economy are two of the three pillars required for stability. The third is the political.

The Presidency Council's cabinet reshuffle on 7 October ushered in four new ministers. The UN will support further appointments which contribute to better delivery to the Libyan people of both services and security. UNSMIL's focus remains on policies, not politicians. On improving institutions, not promoting individuals.

Efforts to amend the Presidency Council continue. UNSMIL appreciates continued contact between members of the House of Representatives and the High State Council, which started in the meetings UNSMIL organized between them in the fall of 2017. We shall see if a true agreement can be reached.

Mr. President

The Libyan people, the UN and the international community have given every opportunity to the House of Representatives to act in the best interests of the country. But the House has failed to uphold its responsibilities. Months after a binding commitment to produce the legislation required to hold a referendum on the Constitutional proposal and Presidential and parliamentary elections, nothing has been seen.

It is now clear that the postponed sessions and contradictory public statements were simply intended to waste time. The body calling itself Libya's sole legislature is largely sterile.

To both Houses, elections are a threat that must be resisted at all costs, but to the citizens, elections are a means of liberation from the ineffective and increasingly illegitimate authorities. According to our latest poll, which I received this morning, 80%, eight zero, percent of Libyans insist on having elections.

Mr. President,

Countless Libyans are sick and tired of military adventurism and petty political manoeuvres.

The time has come to give a wider and more representative group of Libyans the opportunity to meet on Libyan soil, with no external interference, in order to devise a clean path out of the present impasse, reinforced by a clear timetable.

They want to move forwards with the National Conference, and I agree, this is the way forward.

A summer of tragic events, with terrorist attacks, the Oil Crescent crisis, Derna battles, and most recently, Tripoli clashes, have compelled us to delay this important, potentially historic event which evidently cannot be organised in times of acute polarization or armed clashes. Now, conditions are more propitious.

The National Conference is to be held in the first weeks of 2019. The subsequent electoral process should commence in the spring of 2019.

The conference will be Libyan-led and Libyan-owned.

It will build on and develop the contributions of the thousands of Libyans who participated in the 77 preparatory meetings held throughout the country and abroad during the Spring of this year.

The conference will provide a platform for, and give voice to, the Libyan people. With it, they can push these LPA institutions; the House of Representatives, the High State Council, the Government of National Accord, to take the necessary and long-awaited steps to move forward the political process.

This conference is not, is not, to be a new institution nor an effort to replace existing legislative bodies. Rather, as provided for by the LPA itself, it shall create a space for Libyans to crystallize their vision for the transition, and no longer be ignored by their politicians. International support for the National Conference recommendations will be crucial for its success.

Mr. President,

I must now address the situation in the South of the country which is becoming ever more precarious. A complete collapse in services to the population. Rising terrorism and criminality. Rampant lawlessness. Threats to the oil fields and the water infrastructure upon which the nation relies. Foreign armed groups on Libyan soil. Shortages of everything, from fuel to cash, from medicine to food. The problems are countless, and no state institutions are there to tackle them.

Long ignored and marginalised, and now used as a theatre for outsiders, resentment in the South is deepening.

We encourage Member States to support the Libyan authorities to address the foreign presence. The threat posed by open borders has enabled the presence of ISIS, Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups across the south of Libya. This threat was again highlighted by the 29 October ISIS attack on the village of Fuqaha.

We will continue working with the local authorities to provide humanitarian assistance and urge the GNA to step up service-delivery. We would of course welcome your efforts in this field. To that effect, this month we will organise a specific briefing to the international community to present the situation in the South in all its complexity.

Whilst the East remains more stable, there are still challenges there, in political, humanitarian and security terms; including how people coming from Derna are being treated. By my next brief, we shall have opened a United Nations office in Benghazi, which will enable us to better serve people across the east of the country.

I also welcome the PC decision to establish the Women's Empowerment and Support Unit on the 24 of October; in line with LPA. This is a landmark development for all Libyan women, and UNSMIL remains committed and ready to provide support to this unit and urges the international community to do the same.

Libya is caught in a futile and destructive cycle, fuelled by personal ambitions and the nation's stolen wealth. While it is a country endowed with great means in human and material terms it is fast becoming the tragedy of the lost opportunity. The risks are too high to allow this to continue. Civilians are killed in indiscriminate fighting, terrorists are looking at it as a shelter after their defeats elsewhere, human rights are violated on a daily basis, and the next generation of Libyans are held back from fulfilling their potential.

Despite the complexity of the crisis, the solution is straightforward. The path to stability is for the demands and needs of the Libyan citizens to guide the way, and the politicians to follow.

Together, we must support the citizens to speak to their institutions, press the institutions to listen, and compel these institutions in delivering upon what is required of them.

Having taught international relations a good chunk of my life, I acknowledge that competition and rivalry between powers is normal, and somehow legitimate. But its reflection on Libya is truly detrimental. Too many use it as an excuse to maintain an unfair and volatile status quo that impoverishes Libyans and transforms the country into a source of alarm for its neighbours and beyond.

The unity of the International Community is therefore crucial if we want progress in Libya's stabilization; the real challenge being to rebuild a united, legitimate and sustainable state. Not less than that.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Paris', 'Palermo', 'Derna, Libya', 'Benghazi']",Salame slams HoR and HSC as sterile and time-wasting,https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/11/09/salame-slams-hor-and-hsc-as-sterile-and-time-wasting/,None,

He said that UNSMIL had encouraged the Libyan authorities to revise the Tripoli security arrangements and undo what he called the ""intolerable and unsustainable status quo"".

It will be recalled that the 2015 Skhirat Libyan Political Agreement stipulates that the heavy weapons that were used in Tripoli's militia fighting should be stored outside all urban centres. It also stipulates for the formation of non-militia based army and police.

However, the weak Faiez Serraj administration which depends on Tripoli militias to prop it up, has been unable to reform militias into an accountable army and police.

This failure has been a major bone of contention between the Serraj-led Presidency Council and Government of National Accord on the one hand, and the eastern-based authorities in the form of the House of Representatives and Khalifa Hafter and his Libyan National Army.

It is one of the main reasons why the eastern-based authorities have refused to recognize the Serraj Government of National Accord. It has also been a major reason for Libya's whole political process stalling, with Libya stuck in its current transitional stage.

Salame went on to say that Libya's security cannot remain with the armed groups (militias) which continue violating international humanitarian law and human rights while using foreign mercenaries, especially in the the south of Libya.

He reported that this month's Tripoli militia clashes resulted in 120 dead, 400 injured, 5.000 displaced and increased abductions and looting that underline the consequences of Libya's lawlessness.

He said that the long-enjoyed impunity of Libya's militias must be challenged and all grave violations punished. He requested that sanctions be imposed and perpetrators brought to national courts or the International Criminal Court.

Salame said that the UN Security Council sanctioning six human traffickers, earlier this year, was a good first step towards shattering the confidence of perpetrators who seem to imagine that they cannot be punished.

He also pointed out the resurgence of ISIS in Libya, as terror attacks rise, noting that 57 people have been killed in 14 attacks since the start of the year, including two in the latest one on the National Oil Corporation's Tripoli headquarters.

It is not clear if now Serraj will have the courage to reform Tripoli's militias. It is also not clear if he can and whether they will give up their huge power and influence.

It is also not clear if militias will negotiate themselves out of their positions of influence and some of their positions of wealth or whether they need to be defeated militarily.

More importantly, he also announced that he will be standing for Libya's forthcoming presidential elections.

According to the movement's press release the launch of the movement comes ''as the country's parliament, the House of Representatives, has again failed to approve plans for a constitution referendum next month and elections for a new parliament and a president in December''.

Ihya Libya, the statement said, aims to rally Libyans from across the country - cities, towns and villages in the east, west and south, young and old, men and women, the tribes, the different communities - and get it out of its present calamitous disorder and give Libyans confidence and hope in the future.

""We have been in conflict for seven years, and we have been facing destruction,"" Nayed announced at a press conference in Tunis on Wednesday evening. There needed to be a new vision, one that allows Libya to move forward, he said.

In particular there needs to be a future for the country's young people. ""We need to give hope back to young people so that they do not see the gun as the only opportunity.""

The decision to launch the movement is the result of extensive discussions with representatives from towns, tribes, with women and youth campaigners and many other activists as well as with Libyans outside the country about rebuilding hope and putting Libya back on the path to stability, security, development and economic prosperity.

The movement, Nayed explained, is built on four key principles:

These principles were based on all that has been good in Libya's past. Libya has been an open country, a hospitable country and a tolerant country. It is a diverse country and Ihya Libya welcomed that diversity, the statement added.

Nayed called on all Libyans who support these principles to join the movement. Its vision was open to all those who were interested in building the country's future. Supporters who wanted to be candidates for election to the House of Representatives or to municipal councils would be supported with training and organisational backing, the statement said.

The Faiez Serraj-led Libyan Presidency Council issued a decree (1060/2017) yesterday (dated 16 July) authorizing the state-owned General Electricity Company of Libya (GECOL) to ''contract directly'' with the General Electric Company (GE) of the United States.

The contract is worth Euro 33.3 million with 25 percent (Euro 8.3 m) to be paid in advance. The contract is for GE to supervise the execution of the dismantling and installation and technical works, the supply of special equipment required for the maintenance and development of gas units at generation stations.

A ''direct contract'' means GE did not have to engage in a secret tender process.

On a wider note, confirming the GE direct contract yesterday at the weekly press conference, Faiez Serraj's personal spokesperson, Mohamed El Sallak, said that in addition to the GE contract, procedures for completing the other electricity projects suspended through the Jihad fund, and suspended through the lack of disbursement by the Presidency Council of GECOL's budget allotments, were negotiated with the German company (assumed to be Siemens) and the Turkish company (presumed to be Enka Teknik) to resume work with the GECOL.

Sallak gave no further information on the stalled Siemens and Enka electricity contracts.

It will be recalled that the Presidency Council had agreed contracts for electricity projects in December 2017 for generating 2,000 megawatts of power. However, early this month it was forced to announce that these contracts were now on hold due to the Presidency Council's inability to organize funding.

The fast-tracked projects in Tripoli West, Tripoli East and Misrata power stations were intended to overcome Libya's 1,500 MW generation deficit which has been causing acute powers cuts across the country more or less since the 2011 revolution.

The projects were slated to be financed by the Libyan Local Investment & Development Fund (LLIDF), however, Sallak said that the Audit Bureau objected ''in their view'' to the financing of these projects on ''legal'' grounds.

He implied that the PC did not agree with the Audit Bureau's interpretation and Sellak had added that Serraj had requested that both Audit Bureau and PC/GNA officials sit down and find an agreeable legal formula for the completion of the projects as they are important in resolving the electricity crisis that Libyan citizen are suffering from.

However, it seems that no agreeable legal formula has been found and the GE contract may be a short-term fix.

In April this year the Libya Electricity Sector Reform Task Force and GECOL held their first meeting in Tunis with US embassy and USAID officials.

The Task Force is charged with the development of strategic policy, regulatory and operational measures to support a sustainable Libyan electricity sector.

In the short-term, the Task Force will focus on the adaptation and recommendation of a clear GECOL-developed electricity sector policy which is based on international best-practice for electricity sector utilities, and the introduction of an independent regulatory authority for the electricity sector.

Through this Task Force, the Presidency Council is taking important steps to reduce waste and provide more access to electricity for all the Libyan people. U.S. assistance to Libya's electricity sector is a response to a request from the Presidency Council to help identify causes of an ongoing electricity supply crisis in Libya and to recommend strategic actions to alleviate that crisis.

The U.S. Government is making expert advice available to support the work of the Electricity Sector Reform Task Force as it seeks to improve reliable electricity to the people of Libya.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is helping GECOL consider best practices of well-run international electric utilities and providing technical assistance to help implement specific activities.

USAID will conduct workshops for GECOL staff, and other electricity sector stakeholders, highlighting best-practices in commercial loss reduction, energy conservation and revenue enhancement. With USAID assistance, GECOL developed the Electricity Sector Reform Roadmap in 2017.

It will also be recalled that on 7 August last year GECOL and German energy company Siemens signed an MoU in Germany that was supposed to pave the way for the return of the German company to Libya to complete its many outstanding projects. These include the completion of the Ubari power plant in southern Libya, which is reported to be over 90 percent complete, as well as providing urgently needed maintenance to a number of other power plants.

The agreement signed covered GECOL priorities and support that Siemens would provide especially with regards to fast-tracking projects and giving high priorities to the service needs.

These included power plants at Sarir, Benghazi and Misrata to bring existing units back to full capacity on to the grid.

However, like most stalled agreements for projects in Libya, the agreement was subject to the Libyan side organizing funding.

The main obstacles to foreign technicians from all companies have been security and payment. Some companies used to working in high risk zones have indicated to Libya Herald that they can mitigate some security risks, which leaves the issue of payment of outstanding monies.

11398281,2018-07-17,"The UN SRSG and head of UNSMIL, Ghassan Salame, said that the planned Libyan elections in December 2018 should only be held if conditions are ''right''. He called on the international community to send ''clear and strong messaging to those who would attempt to stall or disrupt these elections''.

Presenting his latest report on the situation in Libya to the UN Security Council yesterday, Salame gave credit to the military lull in Libya in early 2018 to the UN efforts on the ground. This was evidenced by low civilian deaths and was thanks to the political process and his Action Plan.

Salame stressed the need for wealth distribution, economic reform and the fight against corruption to ensure Libya's stability. He urged that the economy of predation (Libyans eating away at their state and its resources) is broken.

He pointed out that a minority of spoilers are benefiting from the status quo and would attempt to delay or disrupt the possibility of elections. Without naming anybody, he added that these spoilers held ''crucial, and too often lucrative, official positions''.

He urged all parties to keep to their commitments and timelines of the May 2018 Paris agreement.

Allow me to congratulate Sweden for its Presidency of the Security Council this month. I am grateful for this opportunity to brief you on our work in Libya.

For the first months of this year, Libya enjoyed relative quiet from military actions.

The United Nations helped create this lull. By reviving the political process with the delivery of the Action Plan for Libya, we provided a peaceful means to be heard and the prospect of obtaining official positions. With this has come increased dialogue and fluidity between the localities and the political camps. The number of civilians killed during the exchange of fire fell to only four in March, and five in April.

We capitalised on this positive environment. Let me share four examples.

One. We provided a platform for reconciliation agreements and discussion, opening our good offices to all. We have hosted meetings on the most contentious of issues. For example, meetings on land property grievances, and consultations between internally displaced persons and those from the areas from which they have been displaced.

Two. We supported the conduct of local elections. They took place in Zawiya on the 12 of May. Voter registration is currently ongoing for similar elections in the towns of Bani Walid and Dirge. Dozens more municipal elections are expected to be held this year.

Three. We have re-established the United Nations in Libya; in Tripoli where most of the Mission now resides, and Benghazi where our office will open in the next few weeks.

Four. And I am particularly proud of this. We have concluded the consultative phase of the National Conference Process. Over the last 14 weeks, we have held, thanks to our dedicated partner, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, more than seventy-five meetings in Libya and abroad. Over 7,000 Libyans participated, a quarter of whom were women. 2,000 submissions were received online. 130,000 followers have joined the consultative process on social media, generating half a million comments. Digital messaging reached over 1.800.000 persons. Furthermore, the proceedings have been covered in great detail on Libyan media.

This bottom-up process is an integral part of the Action Plan. It puts the Libyan people at the heart of the political process, whoever or wherever they may be. For many communities, this was the first time they had been actively engaged in the political process and consulted on the future of their nation. Specific events were held for women, internally displaced persons and youth, while others targeted far-flung communities in the South, abroad, and constituencies previously excluded.

The National Conference local consultations have provided a tremendous insight into the hopes, fears and visions of the Libyan people for a way forwards. The next phase of the National Conference is the distillation of the thousands of pages of reports into a full and final report with national conclusions and recommendations, to support the next steps out of transition.

The date and the venue of the final event will be determined soon.

Mr President,

Political progress is linked to the absence of military activity on the ground. Regrettably, the last two months have been marked by military actions and violent developments; diverting attention and draining some of the momentum we had gained.

First, in the eastern city of Derna, where the Libyan National Army moved to take control of the city, leading to two months of battle. The conflict ignited divides across the country, and though the LNA is now in control of the city, small-scale fighting is still ongoing.

Then, we had the events in the Oil Crescent.

On the 14 June, a coalition of armed groups, reported to include foreign mercenaries, attempted to seize control of the facilities in the Oil Crescent region. They successfully captured the facilities, at the cost of numerous casualties and significant damage to critical infrastructure. The Libyan National Army recaptured the area within a week, in a move most expected to reinstate the status-quo, where the management of the fields would be reverted to the internationally recognized National Oil Corporation, which functions under the Government of National Accord.

However, on the 25 of June the Libyan National Army announced that it would transfer management of the oil facilities in the Oil Crescent and of other areas under its control to a non-recognized National Oil Corporation that exists in the East under a parallel authority.

Subsequently, the official National Oil Corporation instituted force majeure upon the oil terminals in Sidra, Ras Lanuf, Hariga and Zuetina. As a result, 850,000 barrels per day of crude oil were blocked from being exported. It is estimated that Libya lost over 900 million US dollars.

The course of events drove a wedge though the middle of the country, deepening division between institutions and regions.

The Secretary General released a statement on the matter, and reminded all of the applicable Security Council resolutions, while offering the good offices of the United Nations.

I have spent the last two weeks reaching out to the various Libyan actors, shuttling to find a solution to this misguided crisis. I was not alone in this; the efforts and support of many Libyans, and numerous member states were invaluable.

On the 11th of July, control reverted to the National Oil Corporation, and production resumed. The end of the immediate crisis has brought a collective sigh of relief; but it is not the end of the matter.

The events have brought to the fore the underlying issues which plague the country and which I have repeatedly outlined to this Council. Namely, frustrations with regards to the distribution of wealth and the endemic plundering of resources.

If these matters are not expeditiously addressed, I fear the agreements made to resume the production of oil will not hold, and it will be difficult to advance the political process. The Mission will redouble its efforts to push for economic reforms, as the very stability and unity of the country are at stake.

If there has been a silver lining in the events, it is that the various authorities in Libya now accept that they need to take action to protect the country's wealth. The request submitted to this Council by the Government of National Accord for a review of the official Central Bank of Libya and the parallel Bank in the East, is a welcome first step to bring transparency to the finances of Libya. I encourage you to look positively upon the request. If the economy of predation is to be broken, its methods must be laid bare, and for this Libya needs all our support.

Mr President

Libyans long to be rid of their current patchwork of institutions. The National Conference consultations taught us that the Libyan people want clear and effective leadership by legitimate bodies, formed through elections. It is telling that while only 600,000 people voted for the House of Representatives in 2014, already one million have newly registered to vote in the next elections.

However, a handful of people defy this popular desire. The few who benefit from the status quo will, if left unchecked, do whatever they can to hinder elections. Unfortunately, they can do much, especially as they hold crucial, and too often lucrative, official positions.

Without the right conditions, it would be unwise to conduct elections. Without clear and strong messaging to those who would attempt to stall or disrupt these elections, the conditions will not be met.

To the leaders of Libya, I say, it is time to return control to the citizens. At the international meeting in Paris on the 29th of May, the Prime Minister, the heads of Libya's House of Representatives and High State Council, and the head of the Libyan National Army committed to engage constructively to enable elections to take place by the end of the year. This deadline is congruent with the Action Plan. I urge you to stand by your commitment, and for others to join you.

Furthermore, the deadline that you agreed upon for the production of the legislation necessary for elections is fast approaching.

While we welcome the resumption of deliberations by the House of Representatives on the 25 and 26 of June, and again today, on necessary legislation for a referendum on the constitutional draft, these are not enough. It has been evident that many members of the House of Representatives, who last month completed their fourth year in office, have not exhibited any enthusiasm for attendance, nor for passing viable electoral legislation.

Members of the House of Representatives should take notice. Libyans are demanding elections, and are becoming impatient with those who find multiple ways and means to postpone this moment.

I recently met with the Speaker of the House. He promised a vote on a law for the referendum of the constitution within the next two weeks, and that electoral legislation would be voted upon immediately after. I truly hope this pledge is kept, this time.

I urge the member states of this Council, to press the House of Representatives to deliver on its historic responsibility and achieve this goal in a timely fashion.

A constitutional framework is needed to arrive at the elections and to end the transition. Since my last briefing, I have engaged in wide consultations on the matter of how and when to establish a new constitution for the country, speaking with senior Libyan judges and constitutional experts from outside, as well as with Libyan people

Both experts and the public agree a clear constitutional framework is a national priority. However, they are divided on how to proceed.

Many would like to see a referendum on the current draft Constitution; while others completely reject this text.

It is a complex issue with no easy options or straightforward solutions.

It is exactly because of this complexity that the international community must show unity. Once we reach a reasonable conformity of views among the Libyans, we are working on, the international community must stand together behind this Libyan vision. If even a single member state chooses to act alone, I can say, the process will go nowhere.

Technical preparations are proceeding for the elections due at the end of this year. Offices are being readied and planning is moving swiftly. Electoral security arrangements are being worked on, including by the newly established unit for these matters within the Ministry of Interior.

While the terrorist attack upon the High National Election Commission devastated much of their headquarters, I am pleased that on the 12th of June the Commission was granted a new compound. There is much work needed to make the premises ready, and accordingly concerted efforts are being made by the Government, United Nations and international partners to renovate the buildings and replace the many items destroyed during the attack.

I am happy that, yesterday, the Government of National Accord approved 66 million Libyan Dinars to fund the elections.

The United Nations Security Council decision to impose sanctions on six leaders of human trafficking networks was a positive step towards accountability for exploitation and human rights abuses.

This progress notwithstanding, impunity still reigns in Libya. Civilians continued to bear the brunt of the escalation of fighting and violence, as witnessed over the past two months in Derna, as it has elsewhere in the country.

Concerns remain over human rights abuses, including summary execution and extra-judiciary arrests

I reiterate the call on all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to protect civilians and to ensure that the wounded and sick, both civilians and those who have participated in hostilities, are cared for, including through medical evacuations.

As in the other areas of Libya where conflict has erupted, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and partners are providing humanitarian assistance. Despite access being hindered, lifesaving materials have been delivered; such as medicines by the WHO and assistance to displaced persons, including 1,000 kits for children. Further assistance will be required, particularly in the areas of health, shelter and mine action.

Regarding the city of Tawargha, there have been only a small number of returns. The conditions for a safe and dignified return are not yet sufficiently in place, as basic infrastructure and services are lacking. At the start of this month demining teams were finally allowed to enter the area and commence their work.

The current situation of IDPs is unsustainable from both a political and financial standpoint, given the lack of available resources to support them. They should be given the right to integrate in their host communities, as efforts are made to facilitate their return.

Libya urgently needs to reverse the deterioration in public services delivery. The United Nations is working with the Libyan authorities, particularly with municipalities across the country, to address these challenges. However, without a resolution to the underlying economic ills in the country, it will always be an uphill battle.

The human rights situation and the humanitarian needs of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers remain dire, and while there have been some improvements in the official detention centres, there are many unofficial installations to which we do not have access.

I have been grateful for the continued support of the members of the Council and of key members states actively engaged to support an end to the crisis in Libya.

I warmly note the arrival of my new Deputy, Stephanie Williams, as a further reinforcement of our efforts.

The status quo in Libya cannot be sustained. The country is in fact, in decline. The crisis in the Oil Crescent gave us a glimpse of what is in store if tangible progress is not made now.

Economic collapse, the breakdown of public services, and more frequent and intense outbreaks of violence.

In a country where terrorists lurk, where criminals are waiting to traffic migrants, where foreign mercenaries are increasing in number, where the oil industry hangs in the balance, this should be of concern to all.

If we are to avert this and support the Libyan people to chart a course to the future they deserve, the unified support of this Council, Member States involved in Libya and our partner regional organisations, is vital.

I recently met with the Speaker of the House. He promised a vote on a law for the referendum of the constitution within the next two weeks, and that electoral legislation would be voted upon immediately after. I truly hope this pledge is kept, this time.

I urge the member states of this Council, to press the House of Representatives to deliver on its historic responsibility and achieve this goal in a timely fashion.

A constitutional framework is needed to arrive at the elections and to end the transition. Since my last briefing, I have engaged in wide consultations on the matter of how and when to establish a new constitution for the country, speaking with senior Libyan judges and constitutional experts from outside, as well as with Libyan people

Both experts and the public agree a clear constitutional framework is a national priority. However, they are divided on how to proceed.

Many would like to see a referendum on the current draft Constitution; while others completely reject this text.

It is a complex issue with no easy options or straightforward solutions.

It is exactly because of this complexity that the international community must show unity. Once we reach a reasonable conformity of views among the Libyans, we are working on, the international community must stand together behind this Libyan vision. If even a single member state chooses to act alone, I can say, the process will go nowhere.

Technical preparations are proceeding for the elections due at the end of this year. Offices are being readied and planning is moving swiftly. Electoral security arrangements are being worked on, including by the newly established unit for these matters within the Ministry of Interior.

While the terrorist attack upon the High National Election Commission devastated much of their headquarters, I am pleased that on the 12th of June the Commission was granted a new compound. There is much work needed to make the premises ready, and accordingly concerted efforts are being made by the Government, United Nations and international partners to renovate the buildings and replace the many items destroyed during the attack.

I am happy that, yesterday, the Government of National Accord approved 66 million Libyan Dinars to fund the elections.

The United Nations Security Council decision to impose sanctions on six leaders of human trafficking networks was a positive step towards accountability for exploitation and human rights abuses.

This progress notwithstanding, impunity still reigns in Libya. Civilians continued to bear the brunt of the escalation of fighting and violence, as witnessed over the past two months in Derna, as it has elsewhere in the country.

Concerns remain over human rights abuses, including summary execution and extra-judiciary arrests

I reiterate the call on all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to protect civilians and to ensure that the wounded and sick, both civilians and those who have participated in hostilities, are cared for, including through medical evacuations.

As in the other areas of Libya where conflict has erupted, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and partners are providing humanitarian assistance. Despite access being hindered, lifesaving materials have been delivered; such as medicines by the WHO and assistance to displaced persons, including 1,000 kits for children. Further assistance will be required, particularly in the areas of health, shelter and mine action.

Regarding the city of Tawargha, there have been only a small number of returns. The conditions for a safe and dignified return are not yet sufficiently in place, as basic infrastructure and services are lacking. At the start of this month demining teams were finally allowed to enter the area and commence their work.

The current situation of IDPs is unsustainable from both a political and financial standpoint, given the lack of available resources to support them. They should be given the right to integrate in their host communities, as efforts are made to facilitate their return.

Libya urgently needs to reverse the deterioration in public services delivery. The United Nations is working with the Libyan authorities, particularly with municipalities across the country, to address these challenges. However, without a resolution to the underlying economic ills in the country, it will always be an uphill battle.

The human rights situation and the humanitarian needs of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers remain dire, and while there have been some improvements in the official detention centres, there are many unofficial installations to which we do not have access.

I have been grateful for the continued support of the members of the Council and of key members states actively engaged to support an end to the crisis in Libya.

I warmly note the arrival of my new Deputy, Stephanie Williams, as a further reinforcement of our efforts.

The status quo in Libya cannot be sustained. The country is in fact, in decline. The crisis in the Oil Crescent gave us a glimpse of what is in store if tangible progress is not made now.

Economic collapse, the breakdown of public services, and more frequent and intense outbreaks of violence.

In a country where terrorists lurk, where criminals are waiting to traffic migrants, where foreign mercenaries are increasing in number, where the oil industry hangs in the balance, this should be of concern to all.

If we are to avert this and support the Libyan people to chart a course to the future they deserve, the unified support of this Council, Member States involved in Libya and our partner regional organisations, is vital.

11398596,2018-10-09,"Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC), BP and Eni yesterday signed an agreement expected to lead to Eni and BP working together to resume exploration activities on a major exploration and production contract in Libya.

A letter of intent (LOI) was signed in London by NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla, BP group chief executive Bob Dudley and Eni chief executive officer Claudio Descalzi.

The parties agreed to work towards Eni acquiring a 42.5% interest in the BP-operated exploration and production sharing agreement (EPSA) in Libya. On completion, Eni would also become operator of the EPSA.

BP currently holds an 85% working interest in the EPSA, with the Libyan Investment Authority holding the remaining 15%.

One of the rationales for this agreement is the fact that Italian energy giant Eni have existing exploration and production activities and infrastructure adjacent to the onshore areas of the BP EPSA.

Transferring the operatorship to Eni creates the opportunity for the resumption of activity following completion of the transaction and relevant regulatory approvals, the joint statement said.

The NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla commented: ""This agreement is a clear signal and recognition by the market of the opportunities Libya has to offer and will only serve to strengthen our production outlook. The agreement's social development guarantee is an important sign of our joint commitment to our staff and the communities in which we work. This initiative will hopefully drive further inward investment and facilitate higher production levels.""

BP's chief executive Bob Dudley said: ""This is an important step towards returning to our work in Libya. We believe that working closely together with Eni and with Libya will allow us to bring forward restarting exploration in these promising areas.""

Eni's chief executive Claudio Descalzi said: ""This is an important milestone that will help to unlock Libyan exploration potential by resuming EPSA operations that have remained suspended since 2014. It contributes towards creating an attractive investment environment in the country, aimed at restoring Libya's production levels and reserve base by optimizing the use of existing Libyan infrastructure

The EPSA includes three contract areas, two in the onshore Ghadames basin and one in the offshore Sirt basin, covering a total area of around 54,000 km2. Originally awarded in 2007, work on the EPSA has been suspended since 2014 when most foreigb oil companies fled Libya due to militia fighting.

As part of the LOI, the signatories also reconfirmed their commitment to promote technical training and other social initiatives in Libya.

As set out in the LOI, the companies intend to finalise and complete all agreements by the end of this year, with a target of resuming exploration activities in 2019.

If the deal goes through and work does indeed resume next year, it will strengthen Eni's position in Libya and shows the importance it holds to its activities in Libya.

It also shows that Eni feels it can mitigate security risks in Libya better than any other foreign oil company operating in Libya.",Libya Herald,energy,,"['Libya', 'London', 'Italy', 'Ghadames', 'Sirte']","NOC, BP and Eni agree to work to resume exploration in Libya",https://www.libyaherald.com/2018/10/09/noc-bp-and-eni-agree-to-work-to-resume-exploration-in-libya/,None,
11398598,2018-07-09,"The Tripoli Central Bank of Libya said that despite the recent ''financial developments and circumstances'' that the country was going through, it will proceed with the implementation of the economic reforms agreed upon with the Presidential Council.

The declaration came at a press conference held in Tripoli on Thursday. The press conference did not include Governor Saddik El-Kabbir but was fronted by heads of departments.

The CBL said that it was in the process of implementing these reforms and that they were in continuous communication with the Faiez Serraj-led Presidential Council. The CBL revealed that formed three committees within the bank, each of which has been assigned certain competences and functions, some of which are in charge of developing procedures, controls and mechanisms for the implementation of reforms and procedures especially with regard to charging fees for foreign exchange sales.

The CBL also revealed that there will be ''a package'' or ''procedures'' taken to limit the (negative) impact of these reforms on low earners or the less well-off through what it referred to as ''fair compensation''.

The CBL was referring to the intended imposition of exchange rate restrictions or levies and to the reduction or removal state subsidies on hydrocarbons.

It will be recalled that the Tripoli CBL and the Presidency Council had agreed on a reform plan at a meeting held during the Libya Economic Dialogue meeting in Tunis on 5 June this year which was moderated by the US Chargé d'Affaires at the US Embassy in Tripoli (now in Tunis) Stephanie Williams.

The Libya Economic Dialogue meeting was the 8 such meeting which was attended by two members of the Presidency Council (PC), Ahmed Maitig and Fathi Majbri, together with Tripoli-Central Bank of Libya Governor (CBL), Saddek Elkaber. Majbri is the PC member in charge of the budget and economic affairs.

Notably, the Tripoli-based Audit Bureau, which usually attended these meetings, did not attend. It had had a fallout with the CBL which it accuses of being directly responsible for Libya's economic austerity.

The Audit Bureau together with the PC and CBL has been jointly responsible for approving Libya's budget. It is not clear if its absence will reduce the likelihood of the success of these planned reforms. However, over the years the Audit Bureau has been bullish in pushing the CBL for proactive economic reforms.

The meeting had agreed on four main economic measures designed to ease pressure on state spending and help alleviate the current economic burden on Libyan citizens, and especially the poorer sections of Libyan society.

These four measures are:

1) The reduction of subsidies on fuel and increasing its price from the current LD 0.15 a litre (about US$ 0.11¢ a litre at the official exchange rate).

2) The increase of the amount of the foreign currency annual allowance at the official rate of exchange, currently set at $500 per person.

3) The reactivation of the child allowance which has been frozen due to lack of state funds.

An ambitious target was set for the implementation of the plan, with the economic reforms planned to be in place by the end of July 2018. The increase in the annual foreign currency allowance and the reactivation of the stalled Child Allowance were meant to mitigate the effects of the reforms, especially those of fuel subsidies.

It will be noted that none of these agreed measures are new or a surprise. They have been discussed ad nauseam in Libya at various occasions and events organized by various bodies over the years. They had also been discussed at several of the previous economic dialogue sessions in Tunis, without results.

On 9 June the Tripoli CBL announced its three-tracked framework for the Tunis meeting reforms.

The CBL had stated that the framework was agreed at an expanded meeting attended by Tripoli CBL Governor Saddek El-Kaber, Fathi al-Majbri, member of the Presidency Council, Mohammad Takala, Chairman, Committee for the Development of Economic and Social Projects of the High State Council, and a number of advisers and CBL department directors.

The CBL said that a ''practical framework for conducting the economic reform agreed upon at the recent economic dialogue sessions held in Tunis through three tracks has been agreed''. These are;

1- Solving the Libyan dinar exchange rate issue through the imposition of fees on foreign currency sales and transfers.

2- Reforming subsidies.

3- Establishing a compensation mechanism to mitigate the repercussions and effects of the economic reform decisions on the livelihood of Libyan citizens.

Meanwhile, in a separate statement, HSC member Takala revealed that money accrued by the state from the foreign exchange levy ''will be used to finance the Family Allowance, dealing with bottlenecks in infrastructure and the maintenance of hospitals and schools''.

In theory, such deep economic reforms would need the House of Representatives (HoR), as the only recognized Libyan parliament, to pass a law. However, as a result of Libya's political split, the Tripoli-CBL and the Audit Bureau have had increased powers in the economic and financial field. The Audit Bureau, in its financial oversight role, has also had the effective authority to stall any economic reform plans it objects to - and its stance on these reform plans is still unclear.

Moreover, the recapturing of the oil crescent by the Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army and the handing over of these facilities to the eastern-based, and internationally unrecognized National Oil Corporation - could negate any attempts at economic reforms while Libya is not exporting any oil.

The Audit Bureau's 2017 annual report which alleged wrongdoing and corruption in a number of state entities was also discussed at the meeting.

At the end-of-meeting press conference, CBL Governor El-Kabber said that ''The march of economic reforms and the suffering endured by the Libyan citizen are deep and our pursuit and our endeavours today culminated in a series of reforms that we affirm.

Of course, what we have arrived at today is the best that could be achieved in view of the current Libyan circumstances, and we really hope that we will move beyond this stage and that, with all the reforms, we may, as far as possible, raise the suffering of the Libyan citizen.

We are all working together to fix what can be repaired hopefully according to the subject schedule we are optimistic about the results of these treatments'', concluded El-Kabber.

In her concluding remarks, US Chargé d'Affaires, Stephanie Williams. said ''We congratulate the Libyan participants for their work to formulate a budget and coordinate on fiscal and monetary policy. We are pleased by the participation today of representatives from the Ministries of Finance and Planning, the Central Bank of Libya, the Libyan House of Representatives, the High State Council and the National Oil Corporation. With the consolidated national budget for 2018 in place, the institutions that matter most to the daily lives of Libyans are in a place to receive funding, including schools and universities, community health centers and clinics, and municipal services like water and electricity. The next step will be to ensure that budget disbursements are made on a consistent basis and with full transparency, so that the Libyan people receive the crucial services they deserve.

The international community represented here today by the U.S., British, French, German, Italian, European Union, IMF, World Bank, and UN missions to Libya all share a concern for the economic situation in Libya, the critical importance of economic stability, development, and stronger growth, and the importance of government institutions to deliver public services to Libyan citizens. Economic reform is not easy under any circumstances. The challenges Libya currently faces are particularly difficult, but this makes reform even more essential. Structural changes are necessary to stabilize Libya's economy, to put your country on the path to prosperity, and address the daily hardships that Libyans continue to face. We are encouraged by the commitment of Libya's political and economic leadership to address these challenges and reach agreement on the financial arrangements, but more must be done to address exceptionally difficult circumstances Libyans continue to face on a daily basis.

We believe that progress on economic reforms will support stabilization and improve the lives of all Libyans. We urge institutions and communities to come together to protect Libya's natural resources and distribute Libya's wealth fairly to communities making legitimate demands for basic infrastructure and services.

With elections on the horizon, the Libyan people will be able to exercise their voice and vote for leaders who can be good stewards of Libya's wealth. We urge all political leaders, ministers, and Libyan government officials entrusted with public resources to manage them judiciously, increase transparency, and minimize fraud, waste, and abuse of power. As noted in the 29 May 2018 Paris declaration, Libya's institutions, including the Central Bank, must unify in order to effectively implement the change the country requires.

Lastly, I want to thank our colleagues from the international community, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank for supporting and providing their expertise and feedback on Libyan economic policy. Your participation today reaffirms the international community's efforts, led by UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya Dr. Ghassan Salamé, to build a more secure, stable, and prosperous future for all Libyans'', Stephanie Williams concluded.

11398600,2018-05-13,"The terrorist suicide attack on Libya's High National Election Commission (HNEC) last Wednesday would not distract Libya from democracy and the planned 2018 elections. The reconfirmation was made by Faiez Serraj head of the Presidency Council through his official spokesperson Mohamed El-Sallak.

Speaking at yesterday's press conference, El-Sallak said that a commission of inquiry was continuing its intensive work regarding the circumstances of the terrorist attack on the HNEC. This is continuing with the follow-up by Serraj and the direct supervision of the Minister of Interior.

In parallel with the investigations, a number of exceptional measures had also been taken to protect the headquarters of HNEC, he added.

El-Sallak added that Serraj stressed that such criminal acts would not hinder the democratic process and the holding of elections, with the stress on the swift fulfilment of the constitutional entitlements based on which the legislative and presidential elections are to be held before the end of this year.

Serraj further echoed this the next day at the opening of the Libyan-Italian Economic Forum. After paying his condolences and respects to the victims of the terror attack of the previous day, he added that it was a warning that Libya's security challenge was still present.

He had said that the HNEC terrorist operation was similar in nature to what was being committed in many Arab and European capitals, which needs to be addressed and ended through unified, regional and international efforts and coordination.

Serraj had stressed that these terrorist operations will not discourage Libya from adhering to the democratic path that it has embarked on, and which these terrorists are enemies of.

11398638,2018-12-16,"Libyan Presidential election candidate, Aref Nayed, said that the international community should use the UN Charter's Chapter VII powers to hold Libyan elections and that he would use force to confront Libya's militias.

He added that he had never intended to be a politician but that he got involved in politics on the second day of Libya's anti-Qaddafi 17 February 2011 revolution.

Nayed was speaking under the banner of ""Libya's prospects: is a political settlement achievable?"" at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London on Friday.

Nayed said Libyans had high hopes of the 2011 uprising, but that eight years later they were now totally disappointed with the misery they have found themselves in.

Conditions have become so bad in Libya that people are now nostalgic for the security and stability of the Qaddafi era, he added.

Libya's multi-faceted civil war and the resultant misery of the situation in Libya led to his desire to help rectify it and was one of the motivations for announcing his early candidacy for Libya's presidential elections.

Total support for LPA

He stressed his total support for the 2015 Skhirat Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) and the efforts of UNSMIL head Ghassan Salame, and that there can be no military solution to Libya's problems.

On the contrary, his problem with the LPA was that it was never fully implemented. For example, the Presidency Council was de facto single-man rule by Faiez Serraj. The PC was only supposed to last for a maximum of two years and it's already in its third year, he pointed out.

Moreover, not only was the LPA not fully implemented to get Libya out of its stalemate but nor was the Paris agreement of May 2018, he lamented.

The failure to implement the Paris agreement to hold elections in December this year was another major failure by the international community to force the Libya issue forward.

Sabotage of elections

Beyond failing to implement agreements, Nayed was disappointed by efforts to actually sabotage efforts to hold elections.

He felt that it was quite a major achievement to get all of Libya's major political figures to agree to an election timetable in the Paris agreement - yet it was sabotaged by many obstructors, including Italy.

Nayed said that one of the main reasons for announcing his early candidacy for Libya's presidential elections was to stress the need for holding Libyan elections.

Nayed said that the Palermo Libya conference was ""a mess"" and all it achieved was a vague promise of a spring election.

Libyans are angry

Nayed warned that Libyans are now very angry and that there could be another uprising in 2019. He said that it was the corrupt Libyan political elite who are united in maintaining the status quo.

The way out: elections

Nayed said that the way out for Libya out of its current predicament was to implement the LPA ""to the letter"". Libya needed to prepare to hold elections as soon as possible.

Use of Chapter VII of UN Charter

If the obstructionist political elite try to sabotage elections then the international community should use Chapter VII of the United Nation's Charter to implement them.

Nayed said that if the international community were prepared to use Chapter VII to remove Qaddafi, then why not use it to ensure the holding of democratic elections.

He did not accept that security was the barrier to holding Libyan elections saying that security today was better than it was in 2014, when Libya's last parliamentary elections were held.

He maintained that excuses not to hold elections were not acceptable, and that they were merely an excuse to maintain the status quo.

Militias

Responding to a question by Libya Herald about militias, Nayed agreed that it was imperative to do something about Libya's weapons and militias. He said that the militias were a ""monster"" that has a wire plugged into the Central Bank of Libya (CBL).

He said that the CBL has the unique distinction of paying the salaries of those killing it and the country.

He added that an end had to be put to the fact that the CBL and Libya's trade finance was being ""controlled by a small clique"".

Asked by Libya Herald about his ""carrots and sticks"" policies for dealing with militias, Nayed was quite bullish in his policy proposal

He said that he would create a pan-Libyan military force of 5,000 soldiers and another 500 Special Operations forces with what he called a ""small air cover"" to confront them - if they would not listen to reason.

He did not elaborate on the details of his intriguing ""small air cover"" proposal.

He was confident that despite the headline figure of the existence of nearly 200,000 militias - these do not really exist.

Nayed said that most of these existed purely on paper for purposes of extracting salaries out of the Libyan state.

In reality, he asserted that only a few hundred would choose to militarily confront the state, a number which he believed were surmountable.

Nayed believes that the Presidency Council and UNSMIL's current policy of dealing with the militias, the so-called ""Security Arrangements"", was ""a total sham"".

He confirmed that militias had been enshrined by the Serraj Presidency Council and that Italy had, for reasons of short-term and short-sighted national interest, ""cut a deal"" with Tripolitania-based militias. Pulling no punches, Nayed said renegade militias would have to either ""surrender"" to the legitimate and democratic will of the Libyan people, or, reluctantly ""die"".

Army reunification

Nayed therefore considered the reunification of Libya's army as imperative. He was bullish about the ongoing Cairo army reunification talks saying that a result was imminent. He was clear that Libya could not progress without army reunification but was confident that the officer class were more United than perceived.

Nayed policy proposal on this front was to start small, with an ad hoc ""pan-Libyan"" election protection force of 5,000 headed by a ""joint command"".

Foreign interference

Nayed attributed Libya's political division to the international community's double recognition of both Faiez Serraj and his Presidency Council and the House of Representatives (HoR).

This dichotomy has been very divisive for Libya and has not helped political reunification efforts. The creation of the High State Council as an advisory body, but which has taken on the role of a second chamber, has added to this political multipolarity.

This political division may have been ""convenient"" for some, he added.

Nayed was scathing of the ""irresponsible"" HoR, Libya's last elected body (in 2014) and it's only internationally-recognized parliament.

He asserted that it was an ""absolute scandal"" that a ""a good chunk"" of its members were ""bribed by the CBL"" and these HoR members were complicit in keeping Libya in its current status quo.

They were failing to carry out their obliged constitutional role by failing to attend HoR sessions and by failing to pass the necessary legislation to move Libya out of its stagnant transitional stage.

Nayed predicted that if things continued as they are in Libya, there would be a popular uprising by the Libyan public next summer or by September 2019 at the latest.

However, it will be recalled that in August, Libya's parliament, the House of Representatives (HoR), had called for Perrone's resignation and replacement and declared him ""persona non grata"".

The HoR had accused Perrone of interfering in Libya's internal affairs by calling for the postponement of the proposed December 2018 elections.

There were also rumours that Perrone was also recalled for ""personal reasons"" or for falling out with the new right-of-centre Italian government.

Buccino Grimaldi had held the Tripoli post from 2011 to 2015 when the Italian embassy, following all the other embassies, was evacuated for security reasons.

Born in Naples in 1961, Buccino Grimaldi began his diplomatic career in 1988 at the Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

From 1991 to 1994 he worked at the Italian embassy in Beirut and from 1 December 1994 he served as the permanent representation of Italy to the European Union in Brussels.

The revelation came through Mohamed El-Sallak, the official spokesperson for Faiez Serraj, the head of the PC during Tuesday's press conference.

The fast-tracked projects in Tripoli West, Tripoli East and Misrata power stations were intended to overcome Libya's 1,500 MW generation deficit which has been causing acute powers cuts across the country.

The projects were slated to be financed by the Libyan Local Investment & Development Fund (LLIDF), however, Sallak said that the Audit Bureau objected ''in their view'' to the financing of these projects on ''legal'' grounds.

He implied that the PC did not agree with the Audit Bureau's interpretation and added that Serraj has requested that both Audit Bureau and PC/GNA officials sit down and find an agreeable legal formula for the completion of the projects as they are important in resolving the electricity crisis that Libyan citizen are suffering from.

11398694,2018-07-03,"Tunis Air is to resume its flights to Tripoli at the end of this month. The announcement was made by Tunisia's Minister of Industry Salim al-Feriani to the media in Tripoli on Sunday.

Feriani made the announcement following his meeting with Libya's Presidential Council Deputy Ahmed Maetig after leading a 70-strong business delegation to the Libyan-Tunisian Economic Forum, held in Tripoli on Thursday.

At the Forum, Feriani said that he expected Libyan-Tunisian trade to reach US$ 3 bn by 2020 having fallen from US$ 2 bn to US$ 1 bn since Libya's 2011 revolution.

He praised the deep Libyan-Tunisian relations and stressed that the visit was part of the promotion of cooperation between the two countries in various fields in order to create a powerful economic body and a gateway for investors from the rest of the world into Africa through Libya and Tunisia.

The Tunisian Minister highlighted the preparation work of the Libyan-Tunisian Joint Commission at the foreign ministerial level next week, paving the way for a summit that will bring together the heads of government of the two countries at the end of August.

If Tunis Air does indeed resume flights to Libya at the end of this month, it will be the first foreign airliner to do so since flights were suspended in 2014. Both Jordanian and Egypt Air have been considering resuming flights, but nothing has materialized yet.

Turkish Airlines had carried out an inspection of Tripoli's Mitiga airport in May, but is yet to make an announcement.

It will be recalled that while Libyan state-owned and privately-owned airliners are currently flying scheduled flights to Tunis, Istanbul. Alexandria, Amman and Khartoum, they are still banned from entering EU airspace. The same applies for EU carriers into Libya.

Although the EU has banned flights between Libya and the EU, this does not cover charters. Prior to 2014, Afriqiyah and Libyan Airlines got around this by wet-leasing aircraft registered elsewhere. Afriqiyah had two Airbus A320s which are registered within the EU, in Lithuania.

In May this year, as part of Mitiga airport's efforts to improve its standards to those required by the EU, Italian company Techno Sky delivered a new mobile air traffic control tower which had arrived in Tripoli port from Italy to be installed at Mitiga.

The tower is one of two that Techno Sky agreed to install at the airport in a multi-million euro deal signed in Tripoli at the end of March. A new fixed control tower is still to be built. Together they will significantly increase Mitiga's capabilities. The March contract, due to be completed by the end of the year also includes training. Techno Sky is a subsidiary of Italian air navigation service company ENAV.

''This suspension of obligations'', the NOC said is in addition to the state of force majeure at the Ras Lanuf and Es Sider terminals. Despite warning from the NOC of the consequences of ongoing blockades, the Libyan National Army (LNA) General Command has declined to rescind its order that no vessel be allowed to port to receive allocated shipments, the NOC said in its statement.

""Despite our warning of the consequences and attempts to reason with the LNA General Command, two legitimate allocations were blocked from loading at Hariga and Zuetina this weekend. The storage tanks are full and production will now go offline."", NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla was quoted as saying.

In its statement, the NOC said it calls on the LNA General Command to lift the blockade and allow the NOC, the only recognised Libyan entity responsible for the exploration, production and export of oil products, under both Libyan and international law, to do its job of providing for the Libyan people. The NOC has always advocated for the equitable distribution of national oil revenue, it added.

The NOC confirmed that Libya's total daily production loss amounts to 850,000 bpd of crude, 710 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of natural gas, and more than 20,000 bpd of condensate.

11398696,2018-06-29,"The Khalifa Hafter-led Libyan National Army (LNA) has warned against the presence of any foreign forces in the south of Libya.

The warning came in a statement released by the LNA General Command yesterday in which it stated that it is opposed to the news that ''some international parties'' wish to establish a military presence in some southern areas of Libya ''on the pretext of opposing illegal migration''.

The LNA General Command statement warned these parties against this and said it considered this a usurpation of international law and an aggression on the Libyan state, its sovereignty and its land.

The statement said that the LNA would take all necessary measures to protect the Libyan state, its borders, its people and institutions.

The LNA General Command statement did not mention any country by name but it is widely believed to have been referring to Italy. There has been some social media news circulating that the new centre-right Italian administration is considering setting up camps or placing Italian forces on the southern Libyan border in an effort to deter illegal Sub-Saharan African migrants from entering Libya and thereon crossing the Mediterranean to Italy.

However, there has been no official statement from Italy substantiating this story. In fact, speaking at a press conference in Rome after returning from his inaugural visit to Libya, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said that these camps (protection and identification centres) should not be set up within Libya, but on its external borders, in neighbouring countries such as Niger, Chad, Mali and the Sudan.

It will be recalled that Libya's Presidential Council of the Government of National Accord had categorically rejected the establishment of any illegal migration camps on Libyan soil, asserting that Libya was a country of transit and is not a source of migratory flows, appealing to the States of the European Union to adopt common policies among themselves on addressing the issue of migration.

He met Presidency Council head Faiez Serraj in Tripoli where according to the Media Office of Libya's Presidency Council, the Italian Minister conveyed the greetings of the Italian Prime Minister Conte, ''reiterating his country's support for the (Libyan) Government the National Accord and emphasizing the strategic nature of the relationship between Italy and Libya. Salvini was also reported to have said that Italy is ready to meet all that is required to stabilize Libya.

Presidency Council head Serraj, for his part, welcomed the Italian Minister and his entourage, stressing the distinctive ties between Libya and Italy, noting Italian efforts to help Libya overcome the current crisis.

The meeting also discussed how to develop cooperation in several areas, including combating illegal migration and human trafficking networks, where it was agreed to develop a comprehensive formula to address this phenomenon, taking into account the various security, economic and humanitarian dimensions, and to attach great importance to securing borders through programmes to train Libyan forces and to take care of Libyan regional development.

The far-right Northern League (Lega Nord) government of Giuseppe Conte is expected to continue to take a hard line against illegal immigrants setting off into the Mediterranean from Libya's shores. It was expected to pressure Libya into creating holding camps for illegal immigrants within Libya.

However, at a later 11-minute press conference held with Deputy head of the Presidency Council Ahmed Maetig, Maetig reiterated to the media that Libya would not allow any holding camps to be created in Libya. Salvini confirmed this and said he will call for the formation of holding camps outside Libya's southern border and will call at a forthcoming EU meeting for the protection of Libya's southern borders.

Maetig called for a conference of Mediterranean states on illegal migration to be held this September, which Salvini supported and said should be held in Tripoli. Maetig also called for a centre of study on illegal migration to be created in Libya.

11398698,2018-05-13,"The Libyan Italian Economic Forum was held in Tripoli last Thursday. The event was opened by Presidency Council head Faiez Serraj and was attended by the Ministers of Economy and Communications, the Italian Deputy Ambassador, the head of GECOL and the Chairman of the National Oil Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and a number of Italian business leaders and representatives of the Libyan-Italian Chamber of Commerce.

The Forum says that it aims to build a strategic partnership of mutual benefits and a programme of economic initiatives, as well as exploring opportunities for investment and joint trade and cooperation by the Business Council of the Libyan-Italian Chamber of Commerce. The forum aims to focus on the oil and gas, renewable energies and investment, infrastructure and services in education, and environment and agricultural sectors.

Opening the event, Serraj paid respect and condolence to the victims of the terrorist bombing of the High National Election Commission's headquarters (HNEC) the previous day, adding that it was a warning that Libya's security challenge was still present.

He said that the HNEC terrorist operation was similar in nature to what was being committed in many Arab and European capitals, which needs to be addressed and ended through unified, regional and international efforts and coordination. Serraj stressed that these terrorist operations will not discourage Libya from adhering to the democratic path that it has embarked on, and which these terrorists are enemies of.

Serraj looked forward to a joint Libyan-Italian relationship based on openness and cooperation through a strong strategic partnership, and to the mutual benefit of the two friendly people. He looked forward to the translation of this partnership into joint investments, programmes and initiatives in the economic, infrastructure and energy fields, the financial sector, the services sector and tourism - noting that there are many industries that can be produced in Libya with the help of the Italian partner.

""In our current planning, we are relying on the public-private partnerships, and until the rules of the market economy are completed, which we are slowly building with due study to preserve the social dimension of this transformation,"" Serraj said.

Serraj expressed his confidence in Libya overcoming the current crisis, saying that he would not speak before the Economic Forum about the current political situation and the solutions presented - led by the need for elections. However, he said that he would touch upon one of the outcomes of the crisis, which concerns Italy and Libya: the issue of illegal immigration.

Serraj said that this problem could be an entry point for an investment that fills the security vacuum and reduces the problem, such as the reactivation of fishing and the establishment of tourism and economic projects along the Libyan coast. In addition to regional development in the southern regions and taking advantage of the decentralized management approach that his Presidency Council supports. With these steps, the Libyan-Italian Forum could take its first practical steps, he noted.

He added that these investments are part of the aims that both Libya and Italy seek in order to make the Mediterranean a lake of peace and cooperation and a market for trade and cultural communication.

With the movement of the economy, Libya could absorb hundreds of thousands of legitimate workers in accordance with existing laws and in accordance to the requirements of the building and development processes, Serraj explained.

Serraj concluded by emphasizing the importance that the Libyan State attaches to youth, ""Understanding the foundation of sustainable development, we request that the forum focus in particular on the Knowledge Economy, qualification and training, and the development of the skills and knowledge needed for that''.

11398728,2018-11-20,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), concurrent with the UN Security Council's Libya Sanctions Committee, has taken action targeting Salah Badi (Badi), the leader of the Sumud Brigade militia that has sparked violent clashes in the south of Libya's capital, Tripoli.

Upon entering Tripoli in late August 2018, Badi also called for support from other militias to attack the city, plunging it into turmoil. The Sumud Brigade has waged attacks against rival militias aligned with the Government of National Accord, through which Badi has undermined the peace, security, and stability of Libya.

""Salah Badi's prolonged militia attacks on Libya's capital have devastated the city and disrupted the peace,"" said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""Treasury is targeting rogue actors in Libya who have contributed to chaos and turmoil that undermines the internationally recognized Government of National Accord.""

Today, OFAC designated Salah Badi pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13726, ""Blocking Property and Suspending Entry Into the United States of Persons Contributing to the Situation in Libya,"" for being the leader of an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Libya, including through the supply of arms or related materiel.

In September 2018, militia forces under Badi's command battled rival militias, despite repeated calls from the UN for all sides to adhere to a ceasefire. Among those killed in the fighting were members of the ambulance and emergency services in Tripoli. Since the beginning of the clashes, Badi's Sumud Brigade has used highly destructive Grad rockets in densely populated areas, adding to the devastation of the attacks.

Badi previously served in the former parliament in Tripoli, the General National Congress (GNC), and is renowned for having led fierce battles to keep the GNC in power beyond its mandate in 2014, during which Tripoli's main international airport was nearly destroyed and suffered more than $2 billion in damage.

Badi's critical role as a commander in the 2014 attacks, which the attackers dubbed Operation Libya Dawn, caused considerable material and institutional damage and led to massive population displacements. As the situation escalated into open armed conflict, the Government of Libya was unable to function properly, the newly elected parliament left the capital, the UN evacuated, and most embassies closed, further exacerbating Libya's vulnerability in the wake of the country's 2011 revolution.

As a result of today's actions, any property or interest in property of Badi within or transiting U.S. jurisdiction are blocked. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with blocked persons, including entities owned or controlled by designated persons.

Voting to extend, until 15 February 2020, the mandate of the Panel of Experts who oversee the sanctions targeting the illicit export of oil from Libya, the Security Council decided that perpetrators of gender-based violence may also be subject to the measures.

Adopting resolution 2441 (2018) by a vote of 13 in favour to none against, with 2 abstentions (China, Russian Federation), the Council condemned attempts to export petroleum by entities outside the aegis of Libya's Government of National Accord. It also reaffirmed the travel ban and assets freeze first laid out in resolution 1970 (2011) (see Press Release SC/101/87/Rev.1 of 26 February 2011), which applies to those engaging in activities that threaten the peace or undermine Libya's political transition.

In renewing the Panel's mandate, the Council decided that such activities ""may also include but are not limited to planning, directing or committing acts involving sexual and gender-based violence"", and requested that its members include expertise on such violence in accordance with operative paragraph 6 of resolution 2242 (2015).

Following the action, Karen Pierce (United Kingdom), Carl Orrenius Skau (Sweden) and Karel Jan Gustaaf van Oosterom (Netherlands) welcomed the resolution as part of the Council's continued support for the Government of National Accord. They also welcomed the expansion of listing criteria to include perpetrators of gender-based violence, emphasizing that it is of particular concern. Sweden's representative expressed willingness to expand the resolution's scope further as necessary to support Libya's efforts to consolidate peace and security.

Jonathan R. Cohen (United States) expressed regret that the text's adoption was not unanimous in order to send the strongest possible message to spoilers in Libya, noting that the resolution designates those trafficking migrants as well as those pirating oil as targets of the sanctions.

François Delattre (France) said the text, as adopted, provides important support to the Government of National Accord.

Anatolio Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) said the atrocious effects of crime in Libya warrant the imposition of sanctions to sexual violence, among others, expressing hope that the measures will help to pacify the country.

Vassily A. Nebenzia (Russian Federation), however, said he cannot support the text because his comments were not taken into account. Noting that its criteria on sexual violence align with existing criteria, he argued that the new, separated category will distract the experts from their direct obligations. The most effective way to suppress all crime in Libya is to target criminal networks under existing categories, he said, emphasizing that the Council's focus must remain on peace and security rather than interfering with the responsibility of such bodies as the Human Rights Council. Pointing out that sexual violence is defined as a general crime under national laws in any country, he urged re-consideration of the penholder system in the Security Council, stressing that penholders are increasingly ignoring consultations, thereby ruining the possibility of consensus.

Russia is believed to have been deploying dozens of troops to Libya over the last few days. The story, first reported by The Sun, sheds light on what the British media said Prime Minister Theresa May had been briefed by the British intelligence as Russia's ""new Syria"" operation.

The troops Moscow has sent to Libya allegedly are meant to back up the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Gen. Khalifa Hifter [Haftar], who is in de facto control of much of eastern Libya. Hifter has long urged Moscow to help his army with troops and military equipment.

Russia allegedly deployed dozens of special forces (Spetsnaz) servicemen as well as officers of the Chief Directorate of the General Staff, previously known as the GRU, Russia's main military intelligence service. Some of these forces had been in Libya initially on a training and liaison mission but they received reinforcement within the last few days.

Russia has also reportedly established at least two military bases alongside Libya's coastline in the towns of Tobruk and Benghazi, that are additionally covered by mercenaries from the notorious Russian Wagner Group. The deployment to Libya has been discussed at least since earlier this year, yet some military experts argue the Wagner Group has had longer outposts in the country.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Russia', 'Libya', 'Moscow', 'Syria', 'United Kingdom', 'Benghazi', 'Tobruk']",Reports of Russian Troops in Libya Spark ontroversy,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2018/10/16/reports-of-russian-troops-in-libya-spark-ontroversy/,None,

The two leaders showed a broad convergence of views in order to foster close cooperation and a common commitment for a united and stable Libya.

Minister Moavero said:

""Italy gives great importance to maintaining an active dialogue with all those who look at the future of Libya through the loyalty of friendship, in the sincere interest of its people and of their full self-determination. Libyan citizens must be enabled to exercise their sovereignty and to freely decide their destiny. The political process initiated must be completed, especially through orderly and transparent elections held in conditions of adequate security.""

Marshal Haftar added that he is ready to contribute to actively support the Country's security, stabilisation and dialogue for the good of all the Libyan people.

11398733,2018-08-29,"Libyan Investment Authority: Statement regarding Commercial Court application to discharge English Receiverships

The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) has applied to the English Commercial Court to discharge three receiverships in England by formally recognising the LIA's Board of Directors, chaired by Dr Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, as appointed by the LIA's Board of Trustees, which was itself appointed by Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) in 2017.

The Commercial Court put in place the receiverships from 2015 to facilitate the management of several LIA court claims in England. Their purpose was to protect the position of the LIA in the face of confusion over the identity of the legitimate Government of Libya and the legitimate Board of Directors of the LIA at that time.

Since then, the GNA has been formed as Libya's executive authority under the terms of the Libyan Political Agreement and is recognised by the UN and the international community as the legitimate Government of Libya.

According to Law No. 13 of 2010 governing the LIA, the LIA's Board of Trustees was appointed by the GNA and is chaired by the Prime Minister, Fayez al Serraj. The Board of Trustees appointed the LIA's Board of Directors, chaired by Dr Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed.

The priority of the LIA's Board of Directors, chaired by Dr Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed (pictured), is to ensure the protection of the LIA's assets for the benefit of the Libyan people. Libya's wealth must be safeguarded for the future prosperity of the country from the LIA headquarters in Tripoli under the sole and effective oversight of the GNA.

The application to discharge the receiverships and bring the assets back under the control of the legitimate LIA Board of Directors is in line with the UN's efforts to safeguard and support Libya's legitimate sovereign institutions. The LIA's Board is also increasingly concerned about the unnecessary ongoing costs of the receiverships.

The LIA also confirms that its application is fully supported by his Excellency, Mr Fayez al Serraj, President of the Presidency Council and Prime Minister of the GNA.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['England', 'Libya', 'Tripoli']",LIA asks English Court to Discharge Receiverships,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2018/08/29/lia-asks-english-court-to-discharge-receiverships/,None,

We value highly our relationship with Libya's National Oil Corporation under the leadership of Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and his team. The NOC is the wealth creator for the entire Libyan people, in the East, West and South. The increased revenues from enhanced oil and gas production are essential to Libya's economic revival and social cohesion.

The NOC has long been and remains both inclusive and independent, focusing on its essential core task across Libya, from Mabruk Oil in the West to the Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) in the East. The efficiency of the sole legitimate NOC is outstanding. Since May 2014 we have admired the exceptional achievements of Chairman Sanalla and his management team in rebuilding oil and gas production, and their remarkable resilience in meeting multiple challenges to grow and develop. We condemn as being against the Libyan national interest any attempts to disrupt the NOC's clear strategy being implemented for the common good.

We respect the NOC's success in restoring and increasing oil and gas production, and strongly support NOC efforts to increase British and international investment in Libya's energy sector, to mutual benefit. We will do everything in our power to encourage increased foreign investment, in fulfilment of NOC objectives. To that end we will facilitate Chairman Mustafa Sanalla's access to British Government Ministers, through the good offices of our Prime Minister's Trade Envoy to Libya, Sir Henry Bellingham MP.

We welcome the decision of the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Ibrahim Jadhran. Sadly, Jadhran is not alone in attempting to use or threaten force with the aim of dividing and weakening the NOC for partisan reasons of personal gain. Such criminal attempts go directly against the interests of the state of Libya and her people, so we condemn utterly the threat or use of force against the NOC by any armed groups. They must be opposed by all right-minded Libyans and by the international community, including civil society and international business bodies.

As we said in September, we were horrified by the appalling murderous attack on the NOC offices in Tripoli, and deeply saddened by the deaths and casualties which were suffered. The LBBC was pleased to play its part in facilitating the admission to the UK for urgent medical treatment of one of the wounded staff, whom Chairman Sanalla has visited in London. We condemn unreservedly all assaults and threats against NOC personnel in any part of Libya. Such criminal actions have no place in the tolerant society which Libya is striving to create, with the NOC in the vanguard.

The LBBC Tunis conference in October gave us a further opportunity to demonstrate our solidarity with the NOC in its successful efforts to develop the Libyan economy. We are proud of the joint Statement of Intent signed by Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and the Chairman of the LBBC on 23 October, and will work to deliver on its commitments. The LBBC remains a steadfast partner and friend to Libya and to the NOC, which is a beacon of hope for the Libyan people in turbulent times. We pledge to maintain and strengthen that support in 2019 and beyond.

At the dawn of a new year, we wish renewed hope, health, happiness and prosperity to the good people of Libya, and particularly to the dedicated, highly professional team in the National Oil Corporation and its operating companies.

Mr Sanalla and his delegation were received by Mr Naji Ahfaf, chairman of the SOC management committee, and other committee members.

The delegation began the visit by inspecting the el-Brega refinery, methanol plant, gas liquefaction plant, and company fire department. The NOC chairman praised the performance of the company's workers, who have succeeded in maintaining operations in spite of difficult conditions faced.

11399102,2018-10-30,"Ties between the United Kingdom and Libya's oil and gas industries were strengthened last week at a major business event in Tunis - ""Building Bridges Together"".

The October 23 event, the biggest Libyan-British trade and investment conference ever held outside the UK, saw the signing of an ambitious 'statement of intent' between its host, the Libyan British Business Council (LBBC), and the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC).

Priority areas in the statement of intent, which can be read in full here, include technical training, advanced technology, restoring production at damaged sites and mature field management to maintain the NOC's successful record of increasing Libya's oil production to over 1.2 million barrels a day.

Chairman of the LBBC, and former ambassador to Libya, Sir Vincent Fean said that the agreement showed ""the cooperation between our two organisations is permanent"" and promised further meetings in 2019 to consolidate on business opportunties. ""I am delighted to see some practical and constructive results from these meetings, cementing lasting partnerships - a genuine win-win,"" he said.

Chairman of the NOC, Mustafa Sanalla commented: ""The meetings in Aberdeen, in May, and this week in Tunis, have shown that the UK is a key partner for Libya in boosting oil production. I welcome the LBBC's efforts and look forward to further progress in building and strengthening this partnership.""

The NOC chairman used his LBBC keynote speech to emphasise the importance of transparency, best practice and adherence to the rule of law.

Sanalla emphasised commercial law as an important lever for the creation of robust institutions. ""Protecting contracts, assets, value, investment, and returns. That is the route out of chaos. The more that stakeholders are invested, the more they are engaged in the promotion of stability and security,"" he stated.

Despite Libya and the NOC being sorely tested over the summer by attacks on oil ports and the NOC headquarters in Tripoli, Sanalla concluded optimistically that: ""The resolution of the crisis was a welcome demonstration of solidarity of the international community, with ports being returned quickly to our operational control. Most importantly, when push came to shove, the 'rule of law' held.""

Sanalla added that he hoped for a period of calm and would like to see oil production rise to as much as 2 million barrels a day by 2020.

Frank Baker, the British ambassador to Libya, praised Sanalla and the NOC as bastions of stability in Libya and revealed that one of the NOC employees injured in a suicide attack at the NOC's headquarters over the summer had been flown to the UK for treatment.

Baker said: ""The NOC continues to lead the way among sovereign institutions in Libya. Their operations have been tested seriously and rigorously over the summer, in the worst possible way, but they have withstood those problems and have been able to maintain the role of helping to get Libya back up on its feet and helping to fund Libya's future. And oil production has remained increasing month on month and year on year.""

LBBC's Building Bridges Together event took over 60 representatives to meet more than 120 Libyan business counterparts. Delegates discussed the need to stabilise Libyan oil production with many existing fields undergoing depletion rates of 7-8 percent and requiring development drilling and many aging fields suitable for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies. New (on-shore and off-shore) oil and gas exploration sites were becoming available with numerous tenders in the pipeline.

Peter Millett, a Director of the LBBC and the UK's previous ambassador to Libya, who hosted a panel on business opportunities in the oil and gas sector, concluded that in order to maintain increases in oil production the NOC would require support for ""more investment, more involvement in redevelopment, modernisation and capacity building in both engineering, education and security"" which the UK was ""willing and able"" to provide.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'United Kingdom', 'Tunis', 'Aberdeen', 'Tripoli']",Britain and Libya Strengthen Oil and Gas Ties,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2018/10/30/britain-and-libya-strengthen-oil-and-gas-ties/,None,

In an opening address at the inaugural Benghazi International Forum and Exhibition of Oil and Gas, Sanalla expressed his happiness to be in Benghazi, the city of his birth, paying tribute to its potential as one of the most important regional oil and gas hubs. He described the forum as 'an important step, encouraging the return of further investment and international partners to work in Libya,' and their potential role in the enhancement of production capacity, and oil revenues.

Sanalla highlighted recent challenges facing NOC, including attacks on oil fields and NOC's headquarters, in addition to numerous divisive false electronic media campaigns. He stated that none of these efforts had achieved their goal, but had only increased the determination of NOC and its employees to help re-build Libya. The NOC chairman went on to remind the audience that NOC's success affects every Libyan:

""We are all aware that the future of Libya, of our children and the unity of our beloved country depend almost entirely on the success and unity of NOC....Libya relies entirely on oil exports to secure the basic needs of our people, from public sector salaries to every pill that can save a child's life.""

Describing the workers of the oil and gas sectors as the 'cornerstone of the country,' Sanalla extolled their efforts: ""You are an example for all Libyans. Your years of personal sacrifice and collective actions on behalf of NOC, putting the interests of Libya above your own, are a lesson and an example for every Libyan - from ordinary citizens to the grandest politicians.""

Sanalla also highlighted the importance of the entire population feeling the benefits of NOC's work:

""I would like to use this opportunity to stress the importance of transparency to ensure the fair distribution of oil revenues across the country. Every Libyan citizen has the right to see how every dinar of their oil wealth is spent.""

Chairman Sanalla thanked the security forces, who guaranteed the safety of the event, the organising committee, and event sponsors, including OMV and Schlumberger, and other forum participants.

He stated his hope that the event would serve as a catalyst for the development of an advanced technology-based energy industry.

The LOI also strengthens the parties' commitment to contribute to social development in the country through the implementation of social impact initiatives, including specific education and technical training programs.

The agreement aims to launch the acquisition process for Eni to obtain a 42.5% participating interest and the assignment of the operatorship, currently held by BP, in the contractual areas A and B (onshore) and C (offshore) in Libya. BP holds an 85% working interest of the second party share in each block, with the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) holding the remaining 15%.

It currently has a package of close to 70 million in bilateral support to Libya in 23 projects across several sectors, such as: civil society; governance; health; economy, youth and education; and support to the political process, security and mediation activities, mainly through the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) and the Instrument Contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP).

Full text:

Through diplomatic action and concrete support, the European Union (EU) is assisting Libya's political transition towards a stable, functioning country and is supporting the United Nations (UN) led mediation efforts in this regard. The EU underlines the importance of inclusiveness of the political process and Libyan ownership, notably through the participation of all legitimate Libyan stakeholders.

The EU provides assistance to Libya through a specific set of measures tailored to the needs of the Libyan people to support the implementation of economic reforms including improved revenue transparency, improve governance and socio-economic conditions, respond to the humanitarian needs and support youth and civil society. Also, in the framework of the trilateral African Union (AU)-EU-UN Task Force, thousands of migrants and refugees have been assisted in Libya. The EU supports the Libyans in addressing security challenges through its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations, EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia, the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) to Libya and the EU Liaison and Planning Cell (EULPC).

The EU firmly supports the UN-led mediation process and the efforts of Special Representative of the Secretary General Ghassan Salamé to implement the UN Action Plan on Libya and bring about a lasting solution to the political crisis. The EU works closely with the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) under the leadership of the Special Representative to support the implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA), consolidation of governance, security and economic arrangements and assist in helping Libyans to prepare for elections through support for the High National Electoral Commission (HNEC).

Through the Stabilisation Facility[1] the EU helps the Government of National Accord (GNA[2]) to gradually strengthen the institutional capacity in particular at municipal level to deliver basic services and rehabilitate local infrastructure.

The EU also engages with neighbours and regional partners including by coordinating efforts with the League of Arab States (LAS), the African Union (AU), and the United Nations (UN) in the framework of the Libya Quartet to advance the political process and assist Libya in its democratic transition.

The EU has been providing significant support to Libya since the beginning of the crisis.

The EU currently has a package of close to 70 million in bilateral support to Libya in 23 projects across several sectors, such as: civil society; governance; health; economy, youth and education; and support to the political process, security and mediation activities, mainly through the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) and the Instrument Contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP).

Through ENI projects the EU contributes to the capacity building of Libyan Institutions at national and local level in the areas of public administration, socio-economic development and the health sector.

In 2017, a special measure, worth 10 million, focussing on urgent needs in the health sector, such as maternal health, blood transfusion services, nurse training, mental health and non-communicable disease prevention was adopted.

The EU supports economic growth, by promoting the development of SMEs, capable of creating employment and livelihoods for Libyans, and in particular for women and youth, through widely accessible and relevant SME support services.

A significant and comprehensive series of actions has been set up by the EU to support civil society in the country. Those include the programme ""Support to civil society in Libya"" (3 million), which aims at promoting and facilitating dialogue between civil society representatives with national and local authorities and the programme ""Civil Initiatives Libya"" (over 5 million) which helped setting up 4 training centres across the country (Benghazi, Tripoli, Misrata and Sabha) and supporting the development and sustainability of civil society organisations.

The European Commission provides humanitarian assistance to those in need, through UN agencies and other international organisations, in full respect of the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. All EU funding is strictly monitored.

The EU provided humanitarian funding worth 10 million in 2017 and 10.8 million in 2016. Assistance goes to Libyans displaced by conflict and helps the most vulnerable gain access to primary health care and emergency medicines, education in emergencies, psychosocial support, food assistance and other essential support.

The EU main priority regarding migration is to protect migrants, refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) in Libya and to support local communities to cope with the challenge.

The EU's support to Libya on migration focusses on programmes that facilitate access to basic services, support to host communities by providing employment opportunities for both the local population and for migrants, and assistance and protection to vulnerable migrants. It also aims at helping to improve conditions for migrants and refugees at disembarkation points and in detention centres, as well as assisting voluntary returns of stranded migrants to their countries of origin and support the evacuation of those in need of international protection.

The EU has mobilised 286 million on migration-related projects; 266 million under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) implemented by UN agencies, EU Member States and NGOs, and 20 million as bilateral assistance.

In the margins of the EU - African Union Summit in November 2017, the EU together with the African Union, and the United Nations set up a joint Task Force to accelerate both the programme of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) for assisted voluntary returns and the emergency transit mechanism of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Leaders also adopted a Joint Statement on the Migrant Situation in Libya. The Taskforce has already contributed to freeing thousands of people from detention centres and is working to expand cooperation and information exchange in the fight against traffickers and smugglers of human beings.

Since 2017, the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa contributed to the voluntary humanitarian return of more than 31,000 vulnerable migrants to their homes, supported with reintegration assistance in their countries of origin. Also the emergency transit mechanism through the UNHCR has been launched and allowed for the evacuation of almost 1,858 people up to date.

With support from the EU, the IOM and the UNHCR are also carrying out protection and assistance in detention centres, disembarkation points and in communities. Within this support, local families are also benefitting from assistance provided by these organisations. More than 61,300 migrants have been provided essential household items (such as blankets and mattresses) and hygiene kits and over 89,000 migrants have received medical assistance outside and inside detention centres and 14,600 children received learning supplies.

The EU is engaged in providing focussed support to Libya through its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations: EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia, EUBAM Libya and the EU Liaison and Planning Cell (EULPC). The CSDP actions in Libya complement and are coordinated with those in the Sahel. The respective mandates of CSDP activities in Libya, due to expire on 31 December 2018, are currently being reviewed by EU Member States.

EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia was launched in June 2015 as part of the EU's broader action to provide a comprehensive response to the global migration and refugee crisis. It aims at countering human trafficking and smuggling by taking action against the criminal networks and disrupting their business model. Operation Sophia has so far contributed to the apprehension of over 151 suspected smugglers and traffickers and has neutralised close to 551 assets. While operating off the coast of Libya on the high seas, Operation Sophia has also been involved in rescuing almost 44,800 lives.

In June 2016, Operation Sophia's mandate was broadened to include two supporting tasks, namely capacity building and training of the Libyan Navy and Coastguard, and contributing to information sharing and contribution to the implementation of the UN arms embargo in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2292. This addition to the original mandate was underpinned by the objective to contribute to the return of stability, both off and along the coast of Libya. On the one hand, the contribution to the fight against weapons smuggling on the high seas, as defined under UNSCR 2292, aims at preventing the security situation from deteriorating further. On the other hand, the decision to support the building of a Libyan coastguard capacity aims at enhancing the Libyan Navy and Coastguard's ability to disrupt smuggling and trafficking activities, perform search and rescue activities and improve overall security in Libyan territorial waters.

In view of complementing broader efforts to disrupt the business model of the smugglers and traffickers both on land and at sea, on 25 July 2017, the Council prolonged Operation Sophia for a further 17 months until 31 December 2018 and amended the mandate to set up a monitoring mechanism of trainees, aimed at ensuring long-term efficiency of the training provided; to conduct new surveillance activities and gather information on illegal trafficking of oil exports from Libya in accordance with UNSCR 2146 (2014) and 2362 (2017), as well as to enhance the sharing information on human trafficking with Member States' law enforcement agencies, FRONTEX and EUROPOL.

To date, Operation Sophia has been able to provide training both at sea and in Member States facilities for a total of 237 Libyan personnel.

In July 2018 the Crime and Information Cell (CIC) was launched, a pilot project to reinforce information exchange among specialised EU agencies - Europol, FRONTEX and the European Border and Coastguard Agency - and Operation Sophia. The cell, located within Operation Sophia, contributes to make work on disrupting criminal networks more effective and efficient.

EUBAM Libya was initially launched in May 2013 as an integrated border management mission in Libya. The mission was downsized in 2014 due to the deteriorating security situation in the country and relocated to Tunis. In February 2016, its mandate was amended to provide for a possible civilian capacity building and assistance crisis management mission in the field of security sector reform, focussing on police, criminal justice, border security and migration.

On 17 July 2017, the Council extended the mandate of EUBAM Libya until 31 December 2018 to plan for a possible non-executive CSDP mission providing advice and capacity building in the fields of border management, law enforcement and criminal justice. This potential future civilian mission would be conducted at the request of and in full ownership of the legitimate Libyan authorities.

EUBAM Libya has also been mandated to progressively engage with and assist the Libyan authorities in a number of priority areas on border management, law enforcement and criminal justice. EUBAM Libya co-operates closely with, and contributes to, the efforts of UNSMIL, liaising with the Libyan authorities and other relevant security actors.

The mission has established a light presence in Tripoli since December 2017.

UNSMIL leads international efforts to support the peace and security process in Libya. The main objective for the EULPC is to support UNSMIL on operationalising all those military and police aspects of the Libya security track, working closely together with the UNSMIL Security Institutions Division (SID). The EULPC is providing vital military planning and intelligence capacity to the UNSMIL SID currently focussing on the implementation of the Tripoli Security Plan, the Presidential Guard and support to further activities to perform once UN's relocation to Libya will be completed. As the main security analysis provider for the International Community in Tunis with a high level of situational awareness and knowledge of politico-security dynamics, the EULPC is also tasked to inform planning for a potential CSDP/Security engagement in Libya.

The EULPC consists of eight military planners under the lead of the Security Expert to the Head of the EU Delegation to Libya.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Tripoli', 'Tunis']",EU Providing 70m to 23 Projects in Libya,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2018/09/26/eu-providing-e70m-to-23-projects-in-libya/,None,

11399419,2018-09-18,"The UN Panel of Experts on Libya has published the final report on its work.

Summary

Over the reporting period, the predatory behaviour of armed groups posed a direct threat to the political transition in Libya. The use of violence to exert control over State institutions was particularly noticeable in Tripoli and could result in a return of armed confrontations. The Libyan Investment Authority, the National Oil Corporation and the Central Bank of Libya were targets of threats and attacks, affecting the performance of the country's oil and financial sectors.

Armed groups are also responsible for targeted persecutions and serious hu man rights violations, which are deepening grievances among some categories of the population and ultimately threatening long-term peace and stability in Libya. Most armed groups involved are affiliated with either the Government of National Accord or the Libyan National Army.

Trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants are substantially benefiting armed groups. These activities fuel instability and undermine the formal economy. Criminal networks organize convoys of migrants and use sexual exploit ation to generate significant revenues. The Panel is concerned about the impunity in Libya of those systematically violating the human rights of migrants, notably due to weak law enforcement and large security vacuums. In this regard, the decision of the S ecurity Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) concerning Libya to sanction six smugglers of migrants represents a key step forward.

The Panel is particularly concerned by the attempts of various armed groups to gain legitimacy by ostensibly supporting efforts to combat irregular migration and thereby receive technical and material assistance from foreign actors. During the current mandate, the use of vessels mounted with weapon s has increased in both the east and west of the country.

A growing number of armoured vehicles and pickup trucks fitted with heavy machine guns, recoilless rifles, mortar and rocket launchers has been observed in combat theatres, notably in eastern Libya. These transfers to Libya indicate that all Member States could considerably increase their efforts to implement the arms embargo.

Arms and related materiel from both former regime stockpiles and transfers conducted after 2011 continue to fall into the hands of Libyan and foreign armed groups. The diversion of arms feeds into the increasing insecurity and constitutes a continued threat to peace and security in Libya and neighbouring countries. Foreign fighters and armed groups, moving in and out of Libya, exploit the proliferation of arms and related materiel in the country, resulting in regular violations of the arms embargo.

Since the beginning of its current mandate in August 2017, the Panel has documented six attempts by the eastern National Oil Corpo ration in Benghazi to illicitly export crude oil. Illicit exports of refined petroleum products, by both land and sea, continue to be a prosperous activity. The Panel has identified networks involved in such activities operating in various regions and their modi operandi.

The Panel has analysed available data and information on the assets of the Libyan Investment Authority and has uncovered two major instances of non -compliance with the asset freeze. Through its enquiries, the Panel has exposed varying pr actices and interpretations in the application of the United Nations sanctions, which could have an adverse impact on the management and proper custody of the frozen assets. The Panel has concluded that the asset freeze has not adversely affected the Libyan Investment Authority.",Libya Business News,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Benghazi']",Final Report of the UN Panel of Experts on Libya,http://www.libya-businessnews.com/2018/09/18/final-report-of-the-un-panel-of-experts-on-libya/,None,

Tens of thousands of displaced people have been living in overcrowded shelters, sharing public bathrooms and kitchens. Thousands of migrants of various nationalities are kept in unspeakable conditions in congested detention centers. We saw the damage the conflict has caused to the lives of people, but also the resilience they have demonstrated. The United Nations and partners are committed to support the people of Libya wherever they are, despite the insecurity and access constrains that hamper their work.""

Accompanied by the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Libya, Ms. Maria do Valle Ribeiro, they travelled together to both countries to reiterate the continuous support of the United Nations towards a peaceful transition in Libya.

""The United Nations is here to support the Government and people of Libya,"" said Mr. Wahba. ""We witnessed firsthand the challenges Libyan women and men are facing, the work that the Government is doing to address needs, and the support our colleagues on the ground are providing. We will continue working with the Government to support a political foundation for longer-term inclusive and sustainable development. Addressing the needs of Libyans in a sustainable manner requires an investment in development through enhancing the capacities of authorities to deliver services to all citizens, reinforce local peace deals and boost municipal capacities.""

Italy, the European Union, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) joined representatives of the Presidential Council (PC) and the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli for the first meeting of the Steering Committee of the programme ""Recovery, Stability and Socio-Economic Development in Libya"".

The three-year programme, funded by the European Union with 50 million in the framework of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, aims to improve the living conditions and resilience of the most vulnerable populations in 24 municipalities across Libya. It targets municipalities highly affected by migration flows and displacement processes of the Libyan populations.

Jointly formulated by the European Commission and Italy in close coordination with the PC, the GNA and with other relevant national and municipal authorities, the programme is implemented by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), with a budget of 22 million, UNDP and UNICEF, for the remaining 18 and 10 million respectively.

Libyan authorities and implementing partners convened to discuss opportunities to directly respond with this programme to the needs of Libyan citizens by supporting municipalities. The aim is to strengthen municipalities in providing basic services, through rehabilitation works, equipment provision and capacity building activities, with a focus on the education, health, water and sanitation sectors.

Minister of Local Governance Baddad Gansu stated: ""The Governments of Libya and Italy started discussing this very important initiative over one year ago. I am very glad to confirm today that all our hard work has paid off. The first Steering Committee of this programme is an important step to confirm the effectiveness of the partnership between the Libyan Government, the European Union and Italy to improve the capacity of the Libyan central and local authorities in delivering key services to the population. We look forward to working closely with the implementing partners of the programme - namely the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation, UNDP and UNICEF - to ensure that communities in all Libyan regions can benefit from this exemplary cooperation"".

""This is a historic day: after one and a half year of joint hard work of Italy and the Presidential Council today we announced the start of the operational phase of the biggest European Union-funded program in Libya. Thanks to our intense and fruitful work with the Ministry of Local Governance, we have established with the Libyan partners a robust framework to address the main requirements of 24 municipalities in all Libyan regions. The first meeting of the programme's Steering Committee was a crucial moment for the implementing partners (Italy with 22 million, UNDP with 18 million and UNICEF with 10 million) to understand the priorities and goals of the Libyan Government. Our priority is to support Libyan institutions in achieving stability by strengthening their infrastructure for service provision, while improving the Libyan population's living conditions. We look forward to work closely with our Libyan and international partners to achieve our common goals in the coming months"", said the Italian Embassy in Tripoli.

""This is the largest programme that the European Union has ever financed in direct support to improving the delivery of key public services by Libyan municipalities. Providing timely access to quality services, in particular for the most vulnerable people of the country, is essential for the future of Libya. As the Programme covers 24 Libyan municipalities, it aims to contribute to a wide and balanced coverage across the whole country"" stated the European Union Ambassador to Libya, Mr. Alan Bugeja.

""After seven years of conflict and increasing migration flows through Libya, the ability of local municipalities to meet the needs of their populations have been severely hampered, with children and young people particularly affected,"" said UNICEF Special Representative in Libya, Mr. Abdel-Rahman Ghandour. ""This latest funding from the European Union, therefore, is extremely welcomed and means UNICEF will be able to ensure that more children are protected, able to get education in a safe environment and access the health services that they need.""

""Municipalities are playing important role in the self-governance of communities. We are pleased to be part of this programme as we hope it will play vital role in changing people's lives by addressing some of their most pertinent needs, localizing SDGs, and harnessing their potential despite crises"" declared UNDP Country Director, Mr. Sultan Hajiyev.

A total of 50,000 square meters of priority residential, utility supply, medical and educational sites will be handed back to Derna's communities through survey and clearance activities.

An additional 25,000 citizens in Derna will receive information on the dangers of explosive remnants of war through Risk Education sessions and media campaigns.DCA expects that at least 50% of beneficiaries will be women.

Months of intense fighting have left Derna's infrastructure severely damaged and the city heavily contaminated with the explosive remnants of war (ERW). Over 19,000 citizens of Derna were displaced to surrounding towns and are now wanting to make a dignified return.

""The displaced people of Derna are anxious to return to their homes,"" said Graeme Ogilvy, programme manager for DCA Libya. ""The families that have already started making their way back to the city face extreme danger from unexploded ordnance which surrounds their homes and blocks access to basic services, including education and medical treatment.""

The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands will contribute EUR 1.5 million to DCA Libya's Humanitarian Mine Action programme. DCA will focus on removing landmines and other unexploded ordinance in and around the city of Derna, as well as to mitigate accidents related to war debris.

Previously the Dutch Government has supported DCA Mine Action projects in the city of Sirte and is currently funding a mine action project in the city of Benghazi.

""This contribution from the Netherlands means that we can educate the local population about the risk of explosive remnants of war, as well as clear residential areas, hospitals and schools of landmines and other unexploded ordnance"" Ogilvy concluded.

""We are proud of the confidence that the Dutch government has shown in us and look forward to continuing the partnership which we have in several countries. For this particular grant in Libya we look forward to save lives and create awareness about the immense risks that explosive remnants pose to a civilian population. Jointly we will be successful,"" says Birgitte Qvist-Sørensen, General Secretary of DCA.

The Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Libya, Ms. Kappeyne van de Coppello confirmed that is important to continue a strong partnership with DCA. ""We find it very important to contribute to safer livelihoods for all Libyan citizens, in both East and West. Together with DCA and its implementing partners we can make this happen"".

The Tunisian Foreign Minister Khamis Jhinaoui said last Thursday that his country agreed with Libya on oil for goods exchange, explaining that a Tunisian delegation had visited Libya to further the agreement.

Meanwhile, the Tunisian Prime Minister Yousif Al-Shahid also announced last September in the Libya-Tunisia Economic Forum the start of discussions aimed at kicking off oil for goods exchange with Libya.

On its Facebook page, the committee clarified that the clashes took place within the Libyan territorial waters, confirming the escape of a number of smugglers and the arrest of a Tunisian boat 20 miles north of Abu Kammash area.

The boat, which included four crewmembers of Tunisian nationality, was taken to the Coast Guard point of Zawiya Refinery, according to the Oil and Gas Crisis Committee.

On the other hand, the Libyan navy media office has stated on its Facebook page earlier today that the seized Tunisian boat is a fishing trawler and its crew were conducting illegal fishing in Libyan territorial waters.

In another statement, the Committee called on the National Oil Corporation, the House of Representatives and the High Council of State to determine their position about fuel smuggling, describing the recent operations carried out by the Air and Naval Forces to prevent fuel smuggling as ""the historical saga of the security services"".

The Libyan-Tunisian border has been undergoing security and military operations on a large scale to prevent and combat smuggling.

The Libyan and Tunisian authorities closed the Wazan Dehiba crossing border in front of traffic movement, except for humanitarian cases and ambulances because of the protest of the Tunisian people living in the border area.

Ras Ajdir border has been closed for weeks from both sides, due to protests in Tunisian cities, after the crackdown carried out by Libyan authorities on smuggling operations.

""Italy's primary interest is to stabilize Libya and to hold the presidential and political elections with appropriate guarantees. We are in no hurry to have the vote tomorrow, or in November or in December,"" Conte told journalists in Rome.

""Libya has strategic importance for Italy, for historical, geographical and political reasons, and the migration routes that cross Libya are concentrated on Italy, so we have a major interest in the relations with the country,"" he clarified, adding that Italy would stress the importance of its interests during Rome Conference on Libya next November.

The Italian Prime Minister noted that US President Donald Trump, during their meeting in Washington last month, highlighted the importance Italy attaches to Libya, which was demonstrated by the support of the United States for a conference on Libya in Italy.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives has declared Italy's ambassador to Libya, Giuseppe Perrone, persona non grata for alleged statement he made to a Jordan-based Libyan TV in which he was reportedly rejected holding elections without national reconciliation and a constitutional basis.

The Committee, which is influenced by instructions of warlord Khalifa Haftar, called in a statement on Wednesday for expulsion of ambassador Perrone from Libya, regarding his alleged statement about elections as ""blatant interference in Libyan internal affairs.""

It also warned that Perrone's alleged statement ""would have a negative impact on the Libyan-Italian relations at the governmental and public levels and would harm Italian interests in Libya.""

The Italian Embassy in Libya denied in a Tweet the alleged statement of its ambassador, saying Perrone confirmed to the Libyan channel that only Libyans can decide when to hold the elections.

Observers see the statement of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives as a double standard because the statement of the Italian ambassador comes in the framework of a clear competition between Italy and France over who takes the leading role in the Libyan crisis, but warlord Haftar's loyalists, who reject the Italian role, are turning a blind eye to the French interference and Paris's attempts to bush for elections this year without a constitutional basis, which may result in a new conflict for power.

The Observers also raised questions over the silence of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives about the obvious intervention of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in Libya's internal affairs and their control of the decision-making process in east Libya camp.

Said added that the Libyan authorities closed Dehiba-Wazen border for fear of a possible reaction by Tunisian traders following the customs procedures recently approved by the Libyan side.

In contrast, a Tunisian security source said that the Tunisian side of the border is open, and the movement of people through the border is normal, including Tunisian and Libyans, as well as urgent humanitarian situations, considering that the reason for the closure has nothing to do with the recent restrictions on smugglers, which was adopted by the Libyan authorities.

11400459,2018-04-22,"Is this really 2018? It started to sound a lot like 2008 in Saudi Arabia on Friday, as the kingdom's oil minister argued that the world could tolerate a higher crude price.

""I haven't seen any impact on demand with current prices,"" Khali Al-Falih told reporters at the meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Jeddah. Arguing that the energy intensity of global economic growth hadn't declined, he offered the view that ""there is the capacity for higher prices.""

President Trump certainly didn't appreciate the sentiment, firing off a tweet that accused OPEC of promoting ""artificially high prices"" which ""will not be accepted.""

Yet setting aside Trump's unique approach to geopolitics, the Saudi comments are indeed troubling. They are an eerie echo of comments made almost exactly a decade earlier by a former OPEC grandee: Libya's Shukri Ghanem. The world economy ""has not reached the tipping point where it can't accept higher prices,"" Ghanem said back in April 2008.

Little did he realize just how close that tipping point was. West Texas Intermediate crude, which had touched a record $116.97 a barrel the previous day, continued to climb for another 3 months as OPEC insisted it didn't need to raise production. But then the collapse came, and it was quite a crash. After trading above $145 a barrel in the first half of July, WTI was below $40 by the end of the year.

Of course, oil prices are nowhere near as high as a decade ago. But it's startling how quickly the lessons of 2008, or indeed the last price crash of 2014, are being ignored -- even if they're unlikely to have been forgotten.

When OPEC met in May, oil ministers were talking quite casually about $50 a barrel as a good price for crude. By the time of the December meeting, several were suggesting that a ""fair"" price for oil was $70 a barrel and at least one put it higher. Now that OPEC's basket of crudes has reached that $70 level, the target appears to have mysteriously moved upwards again. This is mission creep, OPEC-style.

Global demand does indeed seem remarkably robust. OPEC sees it increasing by 1.6 million barrels a day this year. If that happens, it would be the first time since the early 1970s where we've had four consecutive years of oil demand growing by more than 1.5 million barrels a day.

While higher crude prices would naturally be expected to boost spirits in the oil-dependent economies of the Middle East and elsewhere, they may have a chilling effect elsewhere. The growth of U.S. gasoline demand has already started to slow after pump prices rose late last year, and prices are still heading up.

If crude reaches $80 a barrel by the middle of the summer driving season, those gasoline prices could be pressing $3.30 a gallon. Al-Falih might not have seen any demand impact yet, but that could change very quickly -- especially with Trump on the rampage.

Not everyone was as sanguine as Mr Ghanem a decade ago. OPEC's then Secretary General Abdalla el-Badri sounded a warning a couple of months later. High prices were ""not a bonanza"" for OPEC because they had the potential to ""destroy everything"" by curbing oil demand, the chief revenue-generator for most of his group's members. Al-Falih and his boss Mohammed bin Salman, would do well to remember his words.

11400789,2018-02-04,"Theft, corruption and injustice are getting dangerously close to strangling the newly reborn Libyan oil industry in its cradle.

Should anyone outside Libya care? Yes -- OPEC, Europe and the U.S., to name a few.

On the face of it, the National Oil Company had a good year in 2017, building on its successes of late 2016. The country's production tripled between the third quarter of 2016 and the last three months of 2017 -- a feat few thought possible.

But it still has a long way to go to get back to where it was before Muammar Qaddafi was toppled in 2011. And the recovery is at risk.

NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla, speaking at a conference in London last week, told a story that sums it all up. He described how at the end of last year, he sent a small team to investigate fuel smuggling in the west of the country, and found that 83 percent of fuel stations were non-operational, despite receiving deliveries. Nearly all of these ""ghost stations"" had been built after 2010, and he ordered fuel deliveries to them to be stopped. It didn't work. Four days after he issued his order, he got a letter from the Prime Minister's office telling him it was illegal.

Clearly the smugglers are very well connected.

But while such actions may not directly affect the NOC, which presumably got paid for the fuel it delivered, they risk causing local fuel shortages, leaving residents resentful. Those feelings do directly affect the company, which is the backbone of the Libyan economy and therefore a target in a country where salaries are often not paid for months and the population feels disenfranchised. Theft of company property is rife, while communities seeking employment or payoffs resort to blockading oil fields, pipelines and export terminals. The closure of the Sara group of fields from November to mid-January, started by the local municipality, halted the flow of 55,000 barrels of oil a day and cost the state more than $280 million.

And that loss of revenue also has a direct impact on the oil company. Like every other branch of the state, it has to compete for funds whose allocation is, at best, opaque. NOC received only half its capital investment budget in 2017, Sanalla says. That shortfall not only undermines prospects for output growth, it also puts at risk current production if maintenance programs are cut.

On the face of it, this unhappy situation should nevertheless help OPEC achieve its goal of depleting the world's surplus stockpile. After all, rising Libyan oil production has undermined the cuts made by other members of the group, so shrinking it would help speed the market's return to balance.

But Saudi oil minster Khalid Al-Falih should perhaps reconsider the comment he made last month, when OPEC and its friends met in Muscat. He said that Libya should focus on increasing revenue rather than output. The first takes advantage of higher prices, and the second requires volume gains that undermine the price. Relying on higher prices to boost revenue is fine in the short term, but as Al-Falih knows well, to benefit from the rebalancing of the oil market in the longer term producers need the capacity to boost production. And Libya doesn't have it.

The light, sweet crudes produced in Libya are much closer in quality to the liquids produced from U.S. shale rocks than the oil that comes from the Middle East. More Libyan oil means less demand for U.S. exports. That ought to be some comfort OPEC.

Despite the competition for sales, the U.S. can also directly benefit from supporting Libya. The NOC wants to invest $20 billion dollars over the next three years to restore oil output capacity and is planning to locate its only overseas office in Houston. As Sanalla said in November, this would put

America's world-class equipment manufacturers and oil field service providers at the center of our procurement strategy.

Yes, that may be a cynical attempt to get the attention of a U.S. president who thinks in terms of what benefits the nation, but it also sends a clear message to American oilfield service companies and operators, who have long historical ties to Libya. And it's not just the sheer size of the NOC investment -- the U.S. also imports about 70,000 barrels a day of its oil. Canadian refiners and European buyers would also feel the sting of disruption.

So when Sanalla calls on the rest of the oil world to support his company, it should do as he asks. Focusing policies towards Libya on what the country needs -- including inward investment, stable communities and an accountable government -- is a good place to start.

11401056,2018-06-29,"Migrants arriving on Europe's shores are stoking political tensions once again, three years after a surge of refugees threatened to overwhelm the European Union. Although the number of arrivals across the Mediterranean Sea is just a fraction of what it was in 2015, EU leaders are urgently revamping the bloc's asylum system. It's a challenge that German Chancellor Angela Merkel describes as a ""litmus test"" for the future of European unity.

1. What sparked the current crisis?

Anti-immigration political parties across the bloc have surged in popularity, emboldening the push for change. The new populist Italian government came to power arguing that Italians unfairly bear the brunt of the influx -- and their EU neighbors should shoulder more of the burden. The anti-immigrant firebrand Matteo Salvini, Italy's interior minister, refused to allow rescue ships carrying migrants and refugees to dock in Sicily on two separate occasions. Spain and Malta stepped in to offer shelter. Most migrants from Africa land in Italy, arriving via human-trafficking networks in overcrowded vessels from a lawless Libya. Italy estimates that it spent 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) on migrants in 2017, while receiving only 77 million euros in EU aid.

2. How are migrants handled now?

The EU asylum rules, enshrined in the so-called Dublin regulation, assign responsibility for processing asylum claims -- a lengthy and costly process -- to the first nation a migrant enters. That puts a bigger burden on Italy, Malta, Greece and Spain. The rule is widely flouted, and once they enter the EU many migrants press ahead through Europe's passport-free travel zone to richer countries, notably Germany and Sweden. Not all migrants are considered refugees: Those escaping war or persecution are protected under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and can't be turned away. So-called economic migrants move because of poverty or to seek better opportunities, and can be sent home. Nearly all arrivals in Europe claim refugee status and apply for asylum. In 2017, 54 percent of asylum requests were rejected.

3. What are EU leaders considering?

They've been deadlocked for two years over a plan to revamp asylum rules. Nations such as Hungary have balked at accepting their share, while southern countries oppose separate provisions to tighten obligations on handling initial registrations. At a June 28-29 European Council summit in Brussels, Italy forced the issue to the forefront by threatening to veto any resolution that didn't address concrete solutions to the migrant crisis, potentially blocking decisions on other issues such as trade and defense.

4. Did the ploy work?

EU leaders bowed to Italy's requests to harden the bloc's stance. The draft deal includes plans for ""regional disembarkation platforms"" in North Africa to sift out those ineligible for asylum before the reach European shores. To handle legitimate asylum applicants, the agreement aims to balance the burden among EU nations, a proposal that would overhaul the Dublin system. Much remains opaque about the deal, however, not least whether it has any more chance of being implemented than previous attempts at burden sharing. The promise of new EU money to combat illegal migration may help oil the wheels.

5. Why is this an issue in Germany?

Merkel has been facing a rebellion in her ruling coalition from Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who leads the Bavarian sister party of her Christian Democratic Union. He gave the chancellor an ultimatum to secure an EU agreement at the summit that would return migrants to the countries in which they were first registered. If she failed to deliver, Seehofer threatened to start turning away migrants at the German border. While it's unclear whether he would use his ministerial power to follow through, risk being sacked and trigger German instability, Merkel agreed to seek a Europe-wide deal on migration. It's too early to tell if the agreement struck in Brussels will be sufficient for Merkel to fend off the attacks.

6. Is Europe seeing a surge of refugees?

No. Quite the opposite. There was a surge in 2015, when more than 1 million migrants arrived in Europe after Russian bombing escalated Syria's civil war. Most landed on beaches in Greece and headed north through the Balkans in a bid to reach Germany. The flow largely stopped after a March 2016 deal with Turkey, which agreed to accept the return of people who had entered Greece illegally in return for 6 billion euros in aid. The number of arrivals in 2016 fell to about a third of 2015's level, and to around 172,000 last year. Nevertheless, the majority of migrant landings in the last three years were in Italy.

7. So why the concern?

The columns of migrants in 2015-2016 stirred the fears of locals, opened up divisions among EU nations and fueled a populist backlash against establishment parties. Germany, Sweden and other countries temporarily reintroduced some border controls, while Hungary, Slovenia and Macedonia erected fences along sections of their borders. Nationalist politicians have fanned concerns that the refugees, many of whom are Muslim, could bring crime and terror. On June 18, President Donald Trump falsely claimed via Twitter that crime had risen in Germany as a result of migration; statistics show violent crime in Germany fell 2.4 percent last year. One unresolved concern is how to handle the 300,000-plus people who've arrived in Italy since the start of 2016. While they are mostly economic migrants with little chance of asylum, the rest of Europe has no interest in helping to deal with them and Italy can't expel them partly because the countries of origin don't want to accept them back.

The columns of migrants in 2015-2016 stirred the fears of locals, opened up divisions among EU nations and fueled a populist backlash against establishment parties. Germany, Sweden and other countries temporarily reintroduced some border controls, while Hungary, Slovenia and Macedonia erected fences along sections of their borders. Nationalist politicians have fanned concerns that the refugees, many of whom are Muslim, could bring crime and terror. On June 18, President Donald Trump falsely claimed via Twitter that crime had risen in Germany as a result of migration; statistics show violent crime in Germany fell 2.4 percent last year.

11401058,2018-01-31,"Islamic State stunned the world when its jihadist fighters swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, conquering large chunks of territory. The proto-state it established in the two countries has collapsed, with the fall of the group's major strongholds at the end of 2017. But completely defeating Islamic State and like-minded extremists is a larger challenge. The group has repeatedly shown that it can inspire terrorist attacks around the world without orchestrating them from a central headquarters. And like the jihadist group al-Qaeda before it, Islamic State has metastasized beyond its place of origin, with affiliates operating in other parts of the Mideast and in Africa and Asia.

The Situation

The remaining Islamic State fighters have been pushed into an ever-smaller area along the Iraq-Syria border. They have been overcome by Syrian government forces backed by Russian airstrikes, Iranian-allied militias, Iraqi forces and Syrian rebels supported by a U.S.-led coalition. Islamic State lost control of its self-declared capital of Raqqa in Syria in October and of Mosul, its most important stronghold in Iraq, three months earlier. The U.S.-led operation against Islamic State, officially engaging more than 60 nations, combines airstrikes with support for local forces fighting the group on the ground. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. has increased air strikes and delegated more authority to the commanders of its several thousand troops in Syria and Iraq. Russia began bombing Islamic State in 2015 in Syria, backing Syrian government forces. Even as Islamic State has lost terrain, it's become a wider threat, launching or inspiring terrorist attacks in Europe, the U.S. and around the Muslim world. Affiliates of the group have been declared in Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia's Caucasus region and the Philippines.

The Background

The group that eventually morphed into Islamic State was established in Iraq in 2004. It was originally an affiliate of al-Qaeda, the jihadist movement whose leaders the U.S. had driven from Afghanistan after they orchestrated the Sept. 11 attacks. The new group attracted Sunni Muslims rebelling against the occupation that followed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. When American forces toppled Saddam Hussein, the country's Sunni minority lost the dominant role it had held in his dictatorial regime. Like al-Qaeda, which eventually disowned it, Islamic State aims to create a purified Islamic society, but its methods differ. It openly targets Muslim civilians, especially Shiites, whom it considers heretics, as well as fellow Sunnis who oppose it. Weakened in 2007 by a surge of U.S. troops combined with an organized Sunni backlash, the group revived with the 2011 departure of coalition forces. It honed its combat skills in the Syrian civil war that began the same year. In 2014, Islamic State began conquering Iraqi and Syrian cities and declared a caliphate, a state that claims dominion over all Muslims. Using the internet to recruit, it attracted tens of thousands of Muslims from all over the world as fighters in its cause. In the areas under its control, Islamic State practiced systematic violence -- including abduction, sexual enslavement, torture and murder. A United Nations panel concluded it was guilty of genocide against the Yazidi minority.

The Argument

The role of foreign powers in the effort to turn back Islamic State has fueled a debate about whether the intervention will breed resentment among Muslims that could backfire and drive recruitment for the group. Trump's strategy produced a blunter use of force in Iraq and Syria that U.S. officials say accelerated the defeat of the caliphate. However it came at a cost: Reports of civilian deaths from coalition airstrikes in Iraq and Syria have risen significantly, beyond the increase in the strikes themselves. Critics say Trump's approach could be laying the groundwork for the next crop of jihadists.

11401147,2018-12-28,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when a bomb blast hit their bus on Friday less than four km (2.5 miles) from Egypt's world famous Giza pyramids, authorities said.

The blast is the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for more than a year and comes as the tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency revenue, recovers from a sharp drop in visitor numbers since the country's 2011 uprising.

No immediate claim of responsibility was reported. Islamist extremists including some linked to Islamic State are active in Egypt and have targeted foreign visitors in the past.

At least nine Vietnamese tourists were injured, as well as the Egyptian driver, according to official statements.

The tourists were heading to a sound and light show at the pyramids, which they had also visited earlier in the day, said Lan Le, 41, who was in the bus but unhurt.

""We were going to the sound and light show and then suddenly we heard a bomb. It was terrible, people screaming,"" she told Reuters, speaking at Al Haram hospital, where the injured were taken. ""I don't remember anything after.""

The interior ministry said the bus was hit by an explosion from an improvised device hidden near a wall on Marioutiya street at around 1815 (1615 GMT).

About two hours later the vehicle could be seen behind a police cordon with one of its sides badly damaged and the windows blown out, a Reuters reporter said.

Dozens of police, military and firefighters were at the site, on a narrow sidestreet close to the ring road, where traffic was moving normally.

Shortly afterwards, workers brought a pick-up truck to tow the bus away.

An investigator at the scene said the device had likely been planted near the wall.

The interior ministry confirmed the death of two of the tourists, and the state prosecutor's office later said a third had died. In total, 14 Vietnamese tourists had been traveling on the bus, it said.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told local TV from Al Haram hospital that the guide had died from his injuries.

""The bus deviated from the route secured by the security forces,"" Madbouly told Extra News TV.

""We have been in contact with the embassy of Vietnam to contain the impact of the incident, and what is important now is to take care of the injured,"" he said.

The bus driver later told local media he had followed a standard tourist bus route.

Egypt's army and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya.

The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the ""Arab Spring"" protests of 2011.

Those events and the bombing of a Russian airliner shortly after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015 caused tourist numbers to plunge.

11401148,2018-12-25,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Three suicide bombers attacked Libya's foreign ministry in Tripoli on Tuesday, killing at least two other people as well as themselves, authorities said.

The three attackers began their assault with a car bomb, damaging vehicles and buildings, and then opened fire on the ministry, a security source said. Two managed to get inside and blow themselves up. The other was killed by ministry guards.

Heavy smoke rose from the building, which was surrounded by security forces, as people were rushed to hospital. The health ministry said that apart from the attackers, three people had been killed and at least 21 injured.

Interior Minister Fathi Ali Bashagha said however that apart from the attackers only two people were killed, adding that investigations were continuing into the identity of the assailants.

""Security chaos in Libya offers propitious conditions for IS (Islamic State) and other terrorist groups,"" Bashagha said at a joint news conference in Tripoli with Foreign Minister Mohamed Taher Siala.

IS has been active in Libya in the turmoil since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The group took control of the coastal city of Sirte in 2015 but lost it late in 2016 to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes.

Siala called for a partial lifting of the UN arms embargo on Libya to help authorities counter militant groups.

He said the foreign ministry had been targeted because ""it is a symbol of sovereignty"".

""All important documents have been saved,"" he said, adding that he deplored the death of one ministry employee in the attack.

The foreign ministry earlier issued a statement saying: ""The Libyan people are waging a war on terrorism on behalf of the world.""

The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) condemned the attack, stressing the need to ""prevent terrorist groups from turning Libya into a haven or an arena for their crimes"".

11401149,2018-10-24,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya held a rare oil conference in the eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday as its state oil firm NOC reached out to a region home to a parallel government backing a rival oil firm.

The ""Benghazi Oil and Gas Exhibition and Forum"" is the first international business conference in Libya's second-largest city since 2014 when it turned into a battlefield.

Forces of Khalifa Haftar declared victory in July 2017 over Islamists, ending four years of fighting that destroyed parts of the port city.

Hotels and Benghazi airport have reopened but several bombings killed dozens of people this year, forcing organizers to postpone the conference until security had improved.

""Benghazi city will play a prominent and important role for the oil and gas sector in the region and probably the world,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in his opening comments, marking a rare public speech in Benghazi.

An executive of U.S. oil services firm Schlumberger (SLB.N), a partner of NOC, said ""the event will be very important to us and we are looking forward to interesting discussions.

No deals are expected at the two-day forum in the Tibesti hotel, which aims to promote an industry exchange and, more importantly, to appease complaints in the east about few government activities there, industry sources said.

""It's a political message to appease the east,"" said the CEO of a Libyan oil service firm.

NOC has had a rocky relationship with the Haftar and his leadership whose forces control much of east, including major oil ports.

In June Haftar's administration said it wanted to route oil exports from the key Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports through a separate NOC based in Benghazi after its troops seized them back from a militia in a costly battle.

Eastern factions have long accused the central bank in Tripoli of misspending oil revenue and allocating insufficient funds to the east.

NOC has been carefully trying to stay out of Libya's conflict stemming from the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

International oil buyers have stuck with NOC Tripoli, building on decade-long relationships.

But calls for secession or at least autonomy remain popular in the east, known as Cyrenaica or Barqa in Arabic, where much of Libya's oil wealth lies but which was long neglected by Gaddafi as a punishment for opposition.

Libya's government said in 2013 it was planning to move NOC's headquarters to Benghazi to reverse Gaddafi's decision to move the oil leadership to Tripoli from the eastern city.

But the move was never implemented as Libya split into rival administrations in 2014 and fighting broke out in Benghazi.

11401150,2018-04-11,"TUNIS (Reuters) - A Libyan military spokesman declined on Wednesday to address directly reports that key coalition military commander Khalifa Haftar was in the French capital Paris for medical treatment.

Ahmed al-Mismari, spokesman for the Libyan National Army (LNA) that Haftar leads, gave a press statement in the eastern city of Benghazi late on Wednesday, after more than 24 hours of conflicting rumors and reports about Haftar's health and whereabouts.

One high-ranking East Libyan military source told Reuters on Tuesday that Haftar had been flown to Jordan, and would travel on from there to a third country for treatment for a critical health condition.

A second source close the East Libyan military command said on Wednesday that Haftar was in France, but gave no details on his condition. Both sources asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Libya's 218 TV channel, which is supportive of the LNA, reported that Haftar ""was undergoing a medical inspection in Paris and that there was no real danger to his health"".

Several French media also reported that Haftar was being treated at a Paris hospital.

Mismari spoke about the military situation in the eastern city of Derna, which the LNA has encircled, and took no questions.

He also made a general comment about ""lies and rumors"" which he said were spread by the Muslim Brotherhood and aimed at undermining the LNA. It was not clear if the comment was a reference to reports about Haftar's health.

Haftar, 75, has for several years been the dominant figure in Eastern Libya, and has widely been seen as seeking national power in the oil-rich nation of six million.

He has presented himself as a scourge of Islamist militancy, taking a hardline stance against the Muslim Brotherhood, mirroring the position of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a Haftar ally.

Critics, however, accuse Haftar of fuelling armed conflict in Libya.

Haftar is aligned with a parliament and government that moved to Eastern Libya after a major escalation of fighting in the capital, Tripoli, in 2014.

He has spurned the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), which arrived in Tripoli in 2016 as part of United Nations-led efforts to reunify the country.",Reuters,energy,,"['Paris', 'France', 'Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Jordan', 'Derna, Libya', 'Tripoli']",Libyan spokesman: No comment on reports of key commander being treated in Paris,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-haftar-idUSKBN1HI3D8,None,
11401151,2018-02-26,"TUNIS (Reuters) - When Khalifa Haftar flew to Tunis in September, the veteran commander and possible future leader of Libya brought masked troops armed with automatic rifles and grenade launchers in a show of force that drew censure from U.N. experts.

In France, Italy and Tunisia, he also shook hands with ministers and presidents in gilded reception rooms, projecting a different image: that of a man preparing to convert the military gains of his Libyan National Army (LNA) into civilian power.

Haftar casts himself as the person who can bring stability to Libya after years of conflict, ridding the OPEC member of Islamist militants and reining in migrant smuggling to Europe.

Some of those who have worked with him describe him as a divisive military man with little time for politics, who could try to reinstate authoritarian rule and bring more violence to a country where armed groups jealously guard local fiefdoms.

A former ally of Muammar Gaddafi, Haftar, 75, returned to Libya seven years ago from the United States, to join the Nato-backed revolution that ended four decades of one-man rule.

After a protracted military campaign in Libya's second city, Benghazi, he has promised to ""liberate"" the capital Tripoli, split from the east since 2014. Elections, which the United Nations says could be organized by the end of the year despite major obstacles, may provide another route to power.

Haftar seems to be hedging his bets. The LNA, he said last month, has ""sleeper cells"" it could activate to take full control of Libya while prioritizing a political solution to avoid bloodshed.

""But our patience has limits"", he said in the interview published in French magazine Jeune Afrique, before adding that Libya was not ""ripe for democracy"".

Mohamed Buisier, a U.S.-based engineer who served as an advisor to Haftar from 2014-2016 before falling out with him, said Haftar wanted absolute power.

""He wants to get to one of the big palaces in Tripoli and rule Libya - that is it,"" he said.

Haftar's office said he did not immediately have time for an interview.

'ARC OF HISTORY' Among the officers who supported Gaddafi when he seized power from King Idris in 1969, Haftar was disowned by Gaddafi after he was captured leading Libyan forces in Chad in 1987.

He settled outside Washington D.C. in Virginia and returned to Libya only as the revolt against Gaddafi was gathering pace.

""He was there at the beginning with Gaddafi ... he was abandoned by Gaddafi, he left Libya for decades. He would like to see the arc of history corrected,"" said Jonathan Winer, a former U.S. special envoy to Libya who met Haftar in 2016. After Gaddafi was overthrown and eventually killed, Haftar dropped from view, resurfacing in February 2014 with a televised statement pledging to rescue a country mired in instability.

In May that year, he launched ""Operation Dignity"" in Benghazi, merging his irregular forces with army troops and pitting himself against both Islamist militants whom he blamed for a wave of bombings and assassinations in the port city, and an armed alliance that took control of Tripoli soon after. An internationally recognized parliament relocated to eastern Libya and appointed Haftar army chief in 2015, but it was not until early 2016, amid reports of support from foreign states including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, that Haftar started gaining the upper hand in his Benghazi campaign.

Haftar has rejected the United Nations-backed transitional Government of National Accord (GNA) set up in Tripoli in 2016 as fighting raged in Benghazi, dismissing it as unelected and beholden to the capital's militias. ""I'm reaching out to General Haftar once every week to ask him for a meeting,"" former U.N. Libya envoy Martin Kobler said in an interview in July 2016. ""But it takes two to dance a tango.""

The GNA stalled amid political splits and Haftar gained ground from the east, seizing and reopening several key oil ports southeast of Benghazi in September 2016, and replacing elected mayors with military appointees.

By 2017, his international profile was firmly on the rise.

In January he was given a tour of a Russian aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. In July, two weeks after appearing on TV in a starched white uniform to declare victory in Benghazi, newly elected President Emmanuel Macron hosted him in Paris alongside GNA head Fayez Seraj. Senior Western officials began regular visits to Haftar's base at Rajma, near Benghazi.

Oil output, mostly of it from fields under LNA control where foreign firms including Hess Corp, Marathon Oil Corp, ConocoPhillips, Eni, OMV, and Wintershall have holdings, rose above 1 million barrels per day (bpd). Giant posters of Haftar in Benghazi declared: ""I promised and I delivered."" Supporters launched a petition calling on Haftar, now a field marshal, to take national power, and claimed to have gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures.

On the ground, however, things were more complicated.

The oil ports were briefly retaken by Haftar's rivals and fighting in Benghazi dragged on for months after the victory declaration.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) indicted Mahmoud al-Werfalli, a special forces commander attached to the LNA, for allegedly overseeing the summary execution of several dozen prisoners.

Derna, about 250 km (155 miles) northeast, remains under the control of a coalition of Islamists and other local fighters, despite LNA encirclement and air raids.

Rivalries have surfaced between the special forces, mainstream army units, local youths who fought alongside the LNA, and ultraconservative Salafist brigades that have gained power and influence under Haftar, said Mohamed Eljarh, an analyst based in eastern Libya.

""These people don't see eye to eye,"" he said. ""After Benghazi has been declared liberated, basically the common enemy has gone. So now, these differences are coming alive."" Foreign support for Haftar has also wavered, Western diplomats say. Russia has printed money for him and hosted him in Moscow, but has also built ties with his rivals in western Libya with an eye on energy and arms contracts lost in 2011.

U.N. monitors said in a confidential report seen by Reuters that Haftar's display of armed muscle in Tunis amounted ""a serious violation of the arms embargo"" on Libya.

Western officials say he has the formality of Soviet-trained officers of his generation and question his engagement with politics.

""His script is basically security comes first, politics comes later,"" said one foreign visitor who was received several times by Haftar, and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Some diplomats suggest the promise of national polls could contain Haftar, even though with a lack of a unifying candidate or updated election laws, it is far from clear how they can be held. But they also doubt his commitment to civilian rule.

""He is not a convinced democrat,"" said one foreign envoy, adding that Haftar had told him that he intended to run. ""He accepts elections as an acceptable way to do it, provided he will be the winner.""

Buisier said Haftar has surrounded himself with ultra-loyal advisors and relatives, including two of his sons, Saddam and Khaled, who were given military ranks and a brigade to command.

Some of the commander's inner circle accused Busier of supporting Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the late leader's most prominent son, whose whereabouts are unclear but is viewed by Haftar as a potential rival, the former advisor said.

Several other Haftar allies have defected, including a former spokesman and the GNA's defense minister.

Ahmed al-Mismari, the LNA's spokesman, said 90 percent of the force was made up of regular soldiers, denied reports that it was dependent on foreign support, and asserted that the armed escort brought to Tunis was for personal protection and was cleared with Tunisian authorities.

11401152,2018-01-11,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - The United Nations is committed to helping Libya organize elections by the end of this year, encouraged by the rate at which Libyans have been registering to vote, a top U.N. official said on Wednesday.

The U.N. hopes elections can help stabilize Libya, which was thrown into turmoil after long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.

Holding elections is a major challenge in a country still split among military and political factions, and where rival governments have claimed authority since the result of a 2014 vote was disputed. Security in many parts of Libya is poor.

A new electoral law would likely have to be agreed and a referendum on a constitution held before national polls.

A U.N. effort launched in September aims to amend a December 2015 peace plan for Libya and pave the way for a vote, but has so far produced no deal on how to move toward one.

Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, said the U.N. saw elections this year as a route to a ""peaceful and inclusive end to the transition phase"".

""The goal is a Libyan goal: to end the transition phase with an inclusive peaceful process that produces a unified government that is a product of the will of the Libyan people,"" Feltman told reporters in Tripoli after meeting Fayez Seraj, head of the internationally recognized government.

""I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister about the commitment of the secretary-general, the hope of the United Nations, to see inclusive elections take place in 2018, and to pledge the support of the United Nations to support those elections.""

Feltman said the U.N. had been ""very encouraged"" by the apparent enthusiasm for elections, pointing to around half a million new voters who have signed up since voter registration was opened in early December.

""Public opinion poll after public opinion poll demonstrate the strong support of the majority of Libyans from all parts of the country to be able to participate in credible elections and to be able to participate in credible elections in this year,"" he said.

Libya's election commission says a total of 1,965,450 people are now registered to vote, out of a population of more than six million. Turnout in the 2014 election was just 630,000. The polls led to a battle for control of Tripoli, and to rival governments being set up in the capital and in eastern Libya.

11401311,2018-10-02,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy will host an international conference on Libya in Sicily next month to try to bring together opposing forces and forge dialogue in the warring nation, Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said on Tuesday.

The meeting will be held in the Sicilian capital Palermo on Nov. 12 and 13, with key players from both within Libya and abroad expected to turn up, Moavero told parliament.

""We want to find a common solution, even though there will be different opinions around the table,"" Moavero said, adding that the goal was to help restore peace in Libya and facilitate an inclusive political process ahead of possible elections.

Italy has been tussling with neighboring France over how best to deal with Libya, which has been racked by violence for years following the NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew strongman Mummar Gaddafi.

Libyan leaders announced at a conference in Paris in May that they would hold elections on Dec. 10 as part of a French drive to stabilize the North African country.

Italy bristled at the move to fix a date in the face of continued clashes between rival factions, and few Western diplomats believe the vote can go ahead in the current climate.

Moavero said he did not expect the Palermo meeting would focus on specific dates. ""No deadlines will be imposed or tasks set for the Libyans,"" he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has given his blessing to the Italian conference and Moavero said he would fly to Moscow next Monday to discuss the situation in Libya with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Rome expects high-level delegations from Libya's neighbors as well as from the Gulf, Turkey and the European Union.

However, it was still not clear if Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, a dominant figure in the east of the country, would show up in Sicily.

Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) last year seized the country's second largest city, Benghazi, by expelling Islamist and other fighters.

In an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday, Haftar said he still supported plans for national elections in Libya in December but accused other players of not fulfilling their promises that would have paved the way for a ballot.

Italy has thrown its weight behind Haftar's main rival, Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, who leads a U.N.-brokered transitional government based in the Libyan capital Tripoli.

11401555,2018-12-13,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - For the United Nations, it was a chance to clip the wings of powerful armed groups who had held the levers of power in the Libyan capital for years.

The militia were on the back foot after suffering losses to rival factions in the latest convulsion of violence to shake Tripoli; the UN brokered a ceasefire in September, then encouraged the government to start replacing the militia with regular police.

Before they got far, Haithem Tajouri, a powerful militia leader who had left the country two months before, returned with a flourish.

The head of the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade (TRB) toured the city center with his entourage, stopping their vehicles outside banks which unexpectedly extended their opening hours, allowing cash-starved residents to withdraw money.

""Do you want cash?"" Tajouri shouted to women queuing at one bank, an eyewitness said, declining to be named for security reasons.

Tripoli residents posted messages on social media saying Tajouri had arranged the extra access, causing more people to flock to the banks.

Last month, TRB forces patrolling central Tripoli showed Reuters the spot behind the central bank where they said they had driven black market money traders away several times over recent weeks, another crowd-pleasing move.

Tajouri may have acted partly to shore up his own position after his absence and the subsequent killings of commanders affiliated with him sparked speculation his forces were fragmenting.

But his actions also demonstrated the power accumulated by men whose armed followers dominate the city of three million, blocking efforts to end Libya's post-revolution turmoil.

Curbing the militias is crucial to plans, guided by the United Nations, to stabilize the oil-rich North African state nearly eight years after an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, backed by NATO, splintered the country.

Their presence has also complicated plans for elections, initially planned for Dec. 10 and now postponed to next year.

Fighting broke out in August when some militias based outside Tripoli attacked the TRB and three other large groups with strongholds in the capital, angered by their dominance over public money and state contracts.

Since September a ceasefire has been largely observed, with the United Nations and the weak Government of National Accord (GNA) trying to secure a lasting truce.

As part of this, authorities say militias have begun a gradual retreat from strategic sites in Tripoli including banks and ministries. A new interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, has made high-level changes.

The militias are supposed eventually to be integrated into security forces or demobilized, as police take control of two inner rings in Tripoli and military units secure the outskirts, according to three people briefed on the arrangements.

Western countries had previously tried building up an army and police, but largely gave up when the country split between rival governments in 2014.

Under a U.N. deal that bought a new government to Tripoli in 2016, a handful of armed groups entrenched their power, hampering efforts to reunite rival governments and factions in Tripoli and the east.

Some analysts and diplomats say the current U.N.-backed security plan has more chance of succeeding than in the past, arguing that militia leaders are seeking to protect their earnings from a new threat, sanctions.

This year the U.N. Security Council and the U.S. Treasury have issued asset freezes and travel bans against six alleged migrant smugglers, a former oil port blockader and, last month, Salah Badi, a militia leader from the military and business stronghold of Misrata.

But the depth of militia influence meant it was unclear if the GNA had the will to enact change, or could find recruits for a professional force and employment for those who demobilize, a Western diplomat said.

""A lot of militia leaders are suing for peace because they want to keep their ill-gotten gains,"" he said. ""The problem is that there are no jobs (for their followers).""

Some residents see the new arrangements as largely cosmetic, with guards changing uniforms while staying loyal to militia commanders.

U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told Reuters in a statement that ""key appointments have been made and brave decisions have been taken"" since the ceasefire.

But, he added, ""like most Libyans, we feel frustrated with the GNA for their very slow implementation of the arrangements"".

For now, key armed group leaders remain in the foreground.

Tajouri, known for his fashion sense and white G Class Mercedes, was widely seen as more powerful than the prime minister before his absence during recent fighting raised questions over his standing.

His return from the Gulf in a private jet, dressed in blue Emirati robes, triggered speculation that he was aligning himself with the United Arab Emirates, one of the major external players in Libya's conflict.

A report by a U.N. panel of experts last year documented what it said was UAE support for Khalifa Haftar, a veteran commander who controls eastern Libya and has long pledged to ""liberate"" Tripoli by forging alliances in the west. The panel said its requests for information from the UAE had received no response.

Reuters asked the UAE's foreign ministry and media council whether the country supported Haftar and Tajouri and saw an alliance between them as a way to stabilize Libya: officials were not immediately available for comment.

Rada, another major group with a base at Tripoli's only functioning airport, is led by Salafist Abdulraouf Kara, who has links to a network of brigades beyond the capital aligned with the ultraconservative religious ideology.

Tajouri and Kara, neither of whom agreed to an interview, hold high-value prisoners including ex-Gaddafi figures. Their fortunes have roused the envy of groups outside Tripoli.

Some come from Misrata, home to a mix of moderates and radical groups; the latter have been trying to regain lost influence in Tripoli.

Badi, under U.S. and U.N. sanctions for his Al Somoud brigade's attacks on Tripoli, said the international community had helped install militias that mixed the ""tyranny"" of the Gaddafi era with Salafist ideology from Saudi Arabia.

Kara and other ""quietist"" Salafists, including some who have fought for Haftar, tend to respect the authority in power. By contrast, Badi and other Islamist-leaning figures cast themselves as militant defenders of the revolution.

""Their (armed group) leaders protected the government and now control it. They rob the government,"" Badi told Reuters.

Misrata moderates view Badi as a marginalized figure discredited by the assaults on Tripoli. But experts say officials need to engage with a wide range of actors.

""If there is not sufficient outreach to armed groups outside Tripoli to get their buy-in, the new security arrangements risk exacerbating existing tensions,"" said Juan Garrigues of DAG, an independent group that works on dialogue in western Libya.

With elections pushed back, the international community is pinning its hopes on a national conference planned by the U.N. for early 2019 that would hash out the basis of a settlement.

Until then ""the danger is that you're merely shifting the deckchairs on the Titanic"", as the underlying situation for most Libyans continues to deteriorate, said the diplomatic source.

Despite plans for an audit of central bank spending, there was still a ""total lack of transparency"" in the way rising oil revenues are spent, he said.

Militias have penetrated financial institutions, analysts say.

Libya's sovereign wealth fund was forced to recruit staff from Nawasi, one of the main Tripoli groups, and a TRB faction tried to gain influence over the state oil firm NOC, according to a report by the U.N. panel of experts on Libya.

Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeg told Reuters this trend would be reversed as a currency devaluation and increased access to foreign currency deprive militias of key sources of revenue - extortion rackets at banks they control and privileged access to dollars resold at huge profits on the black market.

There was more communication with the armed groups, he said.

11401556,2018-11-08,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya should start the process to hold an election in spring 2019 only after a national conference to discuss its ongoing conflict, the U.N. Libya envoy said on Thursday, officially burying the unlikely idea of a vote next month.

Western powers and the United Nations had originally hoped to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on Dec. 10 as a way out of Libya's conflict raging since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

But violence and a deadlock between rival administrations had made that goal unrealistic, although nobody had declared it officially dead or offered a new time frame.

Instead, the United Nations wants to focus on a national conference to give Libyans a forum to discuss their future and bridge divisions between armed groups, tribes, town and regions, U.N. Libya special envoy Ghassan Salame told the U.N. Security Council.

""The National Conference is to be held in the first weeks of 2019. The subsequent electoral process should commence in the spring of 2019,"" Salame said, without specifying whether he meant it was expected then or it ought to happen then.

Saleme did not give a new date for elections or even mention the Dec. 10 date agreed upon verbally by rival Libyan players at a summit hosted by France in May.

Shelving the vote is the latest setback for Western powers that helped topple Gaddafi seven years ago before stepping back and seeing hopes for a democratic transition crumble.

Salame said the internationally recognized House of Representatives had deliberately failed to approve legislation to hold a vote.

""The House has failed to uphold its responsibilities,"" he said. ""It is now clear that the postponed sessions and contradictory public statements (by lawmakers) were simply intended to waste time. The body calling itself Libya's sole legislature is largely sterile.""

The U.N. had hoped to unify before a vote Libya's two rival administrations - a U.N.-backed one in the capital where a rival assembly is also based, and a largely powerless eastern version aligned with commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control much of the east.

But little progress has been achieved.

""To both Houses, elections are a threat that must be resisted at all costs, but to the citizens, elections are a means of liberation from the ineffective and increasingly illegitimate authorities,"" Salame said.

11401557,2018-11-07,"TUNIS/CAIRO (Reuters) - The United Nations and Western powers have given up hope that Libya will hold elections in the immediate future, focusing on reconciliation first among rival factions locked in a cycle of conflict, diplomats and other sources said.

In May, France had persuaded major players in the North African country to verbally agree to elections on Dec. 10 as a way of ending repeated rounds of bloodshed between competing factions that emerged after a 2011 NATO-backed uprising.

But weeks of fighting between rival militias in the capital Tripoli and deadlock between rump parliaments in Tripoli and the east has made that goal unrealistic, Western officials argue.

Shelving the plans for presidential and parliamentary elections is the latest setback for Western powers that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi seven years ago before stepping back and seeing hopes for a democratic transition crumble.

Instead of pushing for a vote as a short-term goal, U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame will focus in a briefing to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday on staging a national conference next year and fixing the economy, diplomats said.

The conference would aim to forge consensus in a country divided between hundreds of armed groups controlling mostly minimal territory, towns, tribes and regions.

Libya has two governments, a U.N.-backed administration in the capital and a largely powerless eastern version aligned with influential veteran commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control much of the east.

Salame will also push again for economic reforms to end a system benefiting armed groups that have access to cheap dollars due to their power over banks.

There was no immediate comment from the Tripoli-based government or the eastern-based parliament.

Diplomats say delayed reforms introduced in Tripoli in September, including a fee on purchases of foreign currency, can only partially ease Libya's economic woes as long as the central bank remains divided and predatory factions retain their positions.

The reforms have so far done little to improve conditions for ordinary Libyans hit by steep inflation and a cash crisis linked to the fall of the dinar on the black market.

For the militias, the sources said Salame would outline a new ""security arrangement"" for Tripoli aimed at depriving them of control of key sites and integrating their members into regular forces -- something that has proved elusive in the past.

Salame is the sixth U.N. special envoy for Libya since 2011.

Talks to unify rival camps launched in September 2017, shortly after Salame took up his post, ground to a halt after one month with Haftar's role a key sticking point. Many in western Libya oppose him, fearing he could use the position to seize power.

Haftar's Libyan National Army says it is committed to the election process, in which Haftar himself is a possible candidate.

U.N. efforts to stabilize Libya have long been undercut by the divergent agendas of foreign powers.

The international community formally backs the transitional government in Tripoli, but Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have lent Haftar support and European states including France courted the commander as his power grew.

France led the push for elections, believing it could benefit from helping fix the Libya conflict, before realizing the country was not ready for a vote, diplomats say.

""We have to accelerate the process, which is what Salame will say and push on with going to the ballot box,"" a French official said. ""The calendar on elections will slip, but that's not a problem.""

France has vied for influence with Italy, which has sought to protect its oil and gas interests and stem the flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean by building ties in Tripoli, where it is the only Western country to fully reopen an embassy.

Italy is hosting a conference in Palermo next week, where Salame's roadmap will be discussed.

In recent weeks, Western powers and the United Nations have quietly stopped talking about the election in December, without formally declaring it dead.

""The idea is now that Salame will talk about a national conference and economic reforms so people hope the Dec. 10 date will quietly pass away,"" said one source familiar with U.N. plans.

Elections remain the goal, but progress on the ground towards better governance and security were needed in place of ""extended additional thinking sessions"", said a senior U.S. administration official.

""I think pinning everything on a single date for an election has not proved a successful strategy,"" the official said.

11401559,2018-08-06,"MISRATA, Libya (Reuters) - One of Libya's few cancer clinics is relying on donors to keep its doors open for patients who often travel hundreds of kilometers (miles) for life-saving treatment.

Conflict and economic crisis since Libya's 2011 uprising have gutted the health system and made it harder for Libyans to afford private treatment or travel to hospitals abroad.

Medicines and equipment are in short supply, and many of the foreign staff on which the health system previously depended have left Libya.

Internal displacement due to conflict has added to the challenges for facilities that are still functioning, such as the Misrata Cancer Centre, said Mohamed el-Feki, its director.

Some patients travel to the state-run clinic in the port city of Misrata, about 190 km (120 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli, from deep in the Sahara desert.

""The displacement of a large number of people led to crowding and overpopulation in the west (of Libya) and to an increase in the burden on the cancer treatment center,"" Feki said.

The center has been forced to turn to charities and private donors to keep operating.

""We have shortages in all treatments, first and foremost for chemotherapy. It all comes from donations,"" said Haweya Ahmed, a nurse and supervisor in the children's ward.

""One dose can cost 3,000 to 4,000 (Libyan dinars),"" she said, an amount equivalent to between $2,170 and $2,900 at the official exchange rate.

""Some patients come every 15 days, how will they afford this?""

Libya's conflict has left more than 1 million of its 6.5 million inhabitants in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.

Oil revenues that account for almost all Libya's income have fluctuated and rival governments in the east and west of the country have largely failed to provide public services.

A liquidity crisis and fall in the value of the dinar on the parallel market have left Libyans struggling to pay for basic needs.

""It has become really expensive in pharmacies and impoverished citizens are even unable to buy a loaf of bread,"" said cancer patient Ali al-Qantary, who still had not given up on receiving proper state support.

""We hope the government provides the treatment that patients here need.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli']",Libyan cancer clinic relies on donors to treat patients,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-health/libyan-cancer-clinic-relies-on-donors-to-treat-patients-idUSKBN1KR1UE,None,
11401560,2018-03-29,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's conflict cannot be resolved unless the black economy and ""predation of public money"" are ended, the U.N. envoy to the country said, calling on international actors to target ""big traffickers"" with sanctions.

U.N. Special Representative Ghassan Salame is leading the latest push to reunify and stabilize Libya, seven years after the NATO-backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed.

During years of turmoil punctuated by armed conflict, a lucrative shadow economy has emerged in the oil-rich nation, based on foreign currency exchange scams, smuggling and extortion.

""I think this is the most important issue today in Libya,"" Salame said in an interview. ""It is, at least in my modest view, the heart of the matter in Libya.""

Salame, a Lebanese former government minister and professor who took up his post in August last year, said tackling the shadow economy required a ""determined effort"" by the United Nations, international financial institutions and foreign powers.

He said he had been working to convince the international community that any political deal to unify rival factions based in Tripoli and eastern Libya would only be ""cosmetic"" if the shadow economy was not tackled.

""I tried my best to persuade them that if they want a political process they have to put an end to all kinds of traffic in this country. Not only traffic of human beings, but also traffic of fuel, traffic of subsidized (goods), traffic of drugs.""

""They need to address the black market. They also need to address the predation of public money,"" Salame said.

""It's a big challenge - I think we need to start blaming and shaming people. I think we need to look into money transfers.""

Action was also needed ""through specific sanctions against big traffickers taken by the most important economic partners of Libya"", he said.

Control of Libya's informal economy is often enforced through armed groups and military factions, some with official status, which have held real power on the ground since 2011.

Salame has launched a dialogue with armed groups, and has said that he hopes to unveil a strategy for dealing with them by May.

""I think this is necessarily going to be a multi-year problem, because there are a lot of them, and also because the government is not necessarily optimally equipped to integrate them into an army or into police.""

The dialogue is part of a U.N.-led ""national conference"" process that also includes town hall meetings, support for local peace deals and the empowerment of mayors, and reconciliation with exiled supporters of the Gaddafi regime.

""One day, probably in a few weeks or months, we will bring leaders who appeared in all these sub-processes together to meet, but that would be more like the cherry on the cake than the cake itself,"" Salame said.

Salame has called for new elections by the end of the year, though he said he was ""very, very aware"" that polls could add to problems rather than solve them. Parliamentary elections in 2014 were disputed and led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east.

Salame said presidential elections were ""very, very hard to think of"" without a constitution being adopted first, and that he would seek a commitment by major stakeholders to accept results.

""I hope I have a written statement, at least to have a public one.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'Lebanon', 'Tripoli']",Libya won't stabilize unless shadow economy smashed: U.N. envoy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-un-idUSKBN1H51FE,None,
11401561,2018-03-02,"LONDON/TUNIS (Reuters) - French energy company Total (TOTF.PA) substantially raised its presence in Libya with the purchase of a 16.33 percent stake in Libya's Waha concessions from U.S. Marathon Oil (MRO.N) for $450 million on Friday.

The deal will give Total access to reserves and resources in excess of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with immediate production of around 50,000 boe/d (per day) and ""significant exploration potential"" in concessions in the Sirte Basin, the company said in a statement.

""This acquisition is in line with Total's strategy to reinforce its portfolio with high quality and low-technical cost assets whilst bolstering our historic strength in the Middle East and North Africa region,"" said Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne.

Total has been in Libya for decades and holds a production share of 31,500 boe/d in 2017 from concessions in the offshore Al Jurf field and the onshore Sharara field. It also has a share in Mabruk field, which has been closed for several years because of poor security.

The Waha Oil Company, a subsidiary of Libya's state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC), currently produces 300,000 boe/d, which is expected to rise to 400,000 boe/d by the end of the decade, Total said.

Other Waha stakeholders are NOC with 59.18 percent, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) with 16.33 percent and Hess (HES.N) with 8.16 percent.

The oil industry in OPEC member Libya has staged a partial recovery after being hit by blockades and armed conflict following an uprising seven years ago.

National production dropped to lows of about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), before rebounding to 1 million bpd last summer.

It is still well under the 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing before 2011, and the industry has suffered continuing stoppages including the current closure of the southwestern El Feel field due to a protest by guards.

Waha is one of Libya's main export grades. It is shipped from the eastern port of Es Sider, which was blockaded by an armed faction between 2014 and 2016.

Es Sider and other ports in Libya's Oil Crescent are now controlled by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which allowed the NOC to reopen them in late 2016.

Waha's chairman said in November that the company was aiming to increase output to 375,000 bpd by the end of 2018, but faced major funding shortfalls and challenges in maintaining damaged infrastructure.

""Production and reserves growth is a key deal driver,"" Woodmac VP for Corporate Analysis Luke Parker said. ""There's certainly upside from where we are today ... Realising this upside would see Total create significant value through the deal.""

Marathon's sale marks a full exit from Libya, a move it has been considering since at least mid-2013 but has been prevented from doing so by the NOC. [here]

""Our relentless focus on portfolio management has driven seven country exits since 2013 and generated proceeds of over $4 billion just in the last two years,"" said Lee Tillman, Marathon president and CEO.

In a regulatory filing in 2011, Marathon valued the Waha asset at $761 million. At the time, oil prices LCOc1 were roughly double where they stand today. Brent was trading above $63 a barrel on Friday. [here]

""They received what we consider a pretty good price for the asset given that it was considered non-core,"" said Jason Gammel, equity analyst at U.S. investment bank Jefferies.

He said Total were ""probably better able to manage the geopolitical risk of a wide-base of operations across the Middle East.""

11401562,2018-02-21,"DOHA/N'DJAMENA (Reuters) - Chad and Qatar have restored diplomatic relations, their governments said, six months after the West African nation cut ties with Doha in the wake of a rift among Arab states.

Chad closed Qatar's embassy and expelled its diplomats last August, accusing its government of trying to destabilize Chad via its northern neighbor, Libya.

The move came after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar in June for allegedly supporting extremist groups, meddling in their internal affairs and backing regional foe Iran's agenda.

Qatar denied all the accusations.

In a statement reported by the Qatari state news agency QNA, Qatar's foreign ministry said the two countries' foreign ministers signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday to resume diplomatic relations.

11401622,2018-12-04,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - After a month strolling the gold market in Libya's capital, retired public servant Milud Farhat was unable to find any jewelry he could afford for his daughter's wedding.

The 60-year-old is typical of Libya's once well-to-do middle class, impoverished by high inflation and devaluation during years of conflict in what used to be one of the Arab world's wealthiest countries.

In contrast, armed groups whose commanders cruise Tripoli's pot-holed streets in luxury cars have become rich by forcing authorities to hire them and grant them cheap dollars they can change on the black market for a premium.

To tackle this ""war economy"", Tripoli's internationally recognized government in September effectively devalued the exchange rate to 3.9 dinars per dollar from 1.3.

That cut the black market rate from 6 to 5.2, which shoppers and traders said had slightly eased prices for food and other goods, many of which are imported.

But for Farhat, who lives on a pension of 400 dinars per month, it made little difference. The wedding of his youngest daughter, his seventh child, is coming up, and jewelry for the bride is a must in Libya.

""I have been coming every day for a month hoping that (gold) prices go down,"" he said. ""Normal people are just suffering,"" he said.

Gold prices have dipped a little to around 180 dinars ($46) an ounce since the devaluation, but are still triple their level in 2014 when the dinar started diving due to volatile oil revenues, Libya's lifeline.

""The gold market is still very, very weak. Seventy-five percent of people coming are just asking,"" said gold trader Abdelhamid al-Zawi, standing in front of his empty shop.

Economic policies are distorted by rivalry between the Tripoli government and a parallel administration in the east that set up its own central bank in the aftermath of the Nato-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Overall oil revenue is up: the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation expects income from crude and oil product sales to hit $23.7 billion in 2018, a 73 percent jump from last year.

But money in the banks can be scarce. Many keep cash at home as they do not trust banks or play the black market.

To undermine street dealers based just behind the Tripoli central bank headquarters and gold merchants doubling as currency traders, authorities slapped a 183 percent fee on commercial hard currency deals in September, moving the rate to 3.9.

They also stopped restricting credit letters for imports, which Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeg said would help end the liquidity crisis by early 2019.

For a small and well-connected elite, money is still flowing as they keep a grip on business and oil revenues. In Tripoli's upmarket neighborhoods, sleek stores sell international fashion brands and new restaurants and cafes are opening.

But elsewhere in the capital, building projects halted during the 2011 uprising litter the skyline and rubbish lies uncollected. Many are still queuing at banks hoping to access their salaries but are unable to withdraw significant amounts.

11401623,2018-11-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday it had imposed sanctions on Libyan Islamist commander Salah Badi, accusing him of undermining security by directing attacks on groups aligned with Libya's U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

The U.S. State Department said Badi had also been placed under financial sanctions by the U.N. Security Council's Libya Sanctions Committee, and the listing requires all U.N. members to impose an asset freeze and travel ban

The Treasury said in a statement that Badi's militia forces had used highly destructive Grad rockets in densely populated areas in the latest round of fighting in the capital Tripoli in September.

""Salah Badi's prolonged militia attacks on Libya's capital have devastated the city and disrupted the peace,"" said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

""Treasury is targeting rogue actors in Libya who have contributed to chaos and turmoil that undermines the internationally recognized Government of National Accord,"" she said.

Libya's health ministry said late in September that at least 115 people were killed and 383 wounded in month-long clashes between rival factions in Tripoli.

The Government of National Accord also blamed Badi, along with another militia leader, for a May 2017 attack in Tripoli.

The Treasury said Badi played a critical role in battles in 2014 that nearly destroyed Tripoli's main international airport and forced many people from their homes.

Under the Treasury's sanctions, U.S. persons are generally barred from transactions with Badi and any property he may own in the United States is blocked.

11401624,2018-09-23,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - At least 115 people have been killed and 383 injured in month-long clashes between rival factions in Tripoli, Libya's health ministry said on Sunday.

The fighting pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries' Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital's largest armed groups.

Tripoli and western Libya are run by a U.N.-backed government mainly supported by armed groups, while Eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration. The country has been riven since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.

The Kaniyat and other groups from outside Tripoli launched an assault on the capital in late August amid unease over reports of the wealth, power and extravagant lifestyles of some Tripoli militia commanders.

At the Frontline in Tripoli's southern residential areas of Wadi Rabea and Fatma Zahra, shelled houses, torched vehicles, destroyed shops and deserted streets attest to the intensity of the clashes.

""The death toll could surge because of the critical condition of the injured and the continuing fighting,"" Wedad Abo Al-Niran, media officer at the health ministry told Reuters.

The armed groups which claim official status through the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli patrol the area in armored vehicles and pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns.

The fighting has knocked out most power stations in the city and crippled Tripoli's main airport.

Although civilian targets continue to be shelled, Hakeem Al-Sheikh, commander of 42 Brigade loyal to GNA, said ""the situation is under control.""

Meanwhile residents in southern Tripoli continue to bear the brunt of the infighting, with many forced to flee their homes.

""We are staying with our relatives as we are afraid of looting acts,"" said Abdulqader al-Ryani, a father of three who left everything behind when he left his house.

So far, calls by the GNA for all sides to uphold a ceasefire agreed on Sept. 4 have fallen on deaf ears.

Adding to the existing tensions, a coalition of armed groups including Misrata military council promised on Saturday to fight alongside Tarhouna's Seventh Brigade saying that they ""reject the rule of militias inside Tripoli.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Tarhuna', 'Libya', 'Misrata District']","Tripoli clashes leave 115 dead, 383 injured- health ministry",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security/tripoli-clashes-leave-115-dead-383-injured-health-ministry-idUSKCN1M30PO,None,
11401625,2018-09-14,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya is set to miss a mid-September deadline to fix a framework for elections in December, part of a U.N.-led effort to reunify and stabilize a country that splintered after the Nato-backed uprising which overthrew Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The capital has been shaken by heavy clashes and a militant attack on the headquarters of state oil firm NOC, casting new doubt on the election plan.

Powerful armed groups, including ultra-conservative Salafists and neighborhood militiamen, have consolidated their grip under the watch of the internationally recognized government.

The growing strength and wealth of these ""super militias"" has stirred resentment among rivals excluded from the capital or from access to lucrative financial scams and the shadow economy.

The splits have also given space to Islamist militants trying to regroup after Islamic State lost its stronghold of Sirte in 2016.

Since disputed elections and an escalation of fighting in 2014 there have been rival governments, one based in the east and the other in the capital Tripoli.

Tripoli is home to the unelected Government of National Accord (GNA), an interim administration brought in by a U.N.-brokered deal in December 2015.

The GNA has built some fragile alliances in western regions, but has little popular support or leverage over Tripoli's militias, on which it depends for its own security.

Eastern Libya is under the control of the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by veteran military commander Khalifa Haftar, a former general under Gaddafi who fell out with the late dictator.

The east-west division has split key institutions and produced a deadlock between the rump parliaments aligned with rival, shifting military factions.

However, international support has allowed the NOC in Tripoli to retain control of fluctuating oil production, a vital source of income.

Energy revenues are processed through the central bank in Tripoli, which disburses state salaries, dollars for importers and funds for the GNA - a process that Libya's Audit Bureau and U.N. experts say is riddled with corruption.

Neither the eastern nor western camps have much control over Libya's south, where communitarian violence sometimes erupts and where smugglers, Islamist militants and mercenaries are active.

Libya's faultlines began to show as local groups took up arms seven years ago against the Gaddafi regime, but also against each other.

Militias claiming revolutionary credentials, their numbers swelling as more young men were added to the payroll, hijacked the political process in a country awash with weapons.

Things deteriorated before and after elections in 2014, when a battle for control of Tripoli destroyed the city's international airport.

Haftar, presenting himself as the scourge of Islamists, began a campaign in Benghazi that took more than three years to complete and left parts of Libya's second city in ruins.

Islamic State were expelled from Sirte in 2016 by local forces supported by U.S. air strikes, oil production partially recovered as blockaders were sidelined, and migrant smuggling networks were curbed last year under strong Italian pressure.

But without reconciliation, those gains remain fragile.

Libya has a population of just 6.5 million but a vast land area with largely unguarded borders.

It has been a source of large-scale smuggling and trafficking of people toward Europe.

Libya has Africa's largest oil reserves, and is a key supplier of gas to Italy. As conflict has disrupted oil production, Egyptian and Tunisian migrant workers have lost out.

More than one million Libyans need humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.

International efforts to broker a deal between the main factions have repeatedly failed.

The U.N. deal in 2015 had little support from powerbrokers on the ground. Subsequent efforts to form a unity government with national backing ran aground in rival assemblies in Tripoli and the east, which themselves have only limited legitimacy.

France has pushed for polls as a way to end the stalemate and hosted a summit in May at which the election date target of December 10 was set.

Key figures including Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, both potential candidates, have publicly backed the idea of elections. The United Nations cites recent voter registration as evidence that Libyan citizens are keen for a national vote as a way to make a clean break.

Others are more skeptical about early polls, notably Italy, the only Western state to have fully reopened its embassy in Tripoli. It has been vying with France for influence in Libya.

Diplomats say privately that political, security and logistical challenges make a successful vote hard to achieve. The international community's latest attempts to get the eastern parliament to pave the way for elections have produced little concrete progress.

The assembly, still recognized as the primary legislative chamber, is boycotted by many of its members and controlled by factions that have spurned the U.N. process and the GNA. They have used procedural delays and sometimes physical force to prevent key votes from taking place.

11401626,2018-08-08,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's sovereign wealth fund has decided to move from its main office in Tripoli due to security breaches after a number of staff were threatened or abducted, it said in statement on Wednesday.

The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which holds about $66 billion-worth of mostly frozen assets, has long been at the center of leadership disputes and power struggles that reflect Libya's political splits.

These have sometimes played out at the LIA's main offices in the Tripoli Tower office block, where the head of the fund appointed two years ago by Libya's internationally recognized government, Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, had managed to install himself following a dispute with a rival claimant.

Tripoli is largely controlled by a handful of powerful armed groups claiming official status that have expanded their economic interests, penetrated key institutions and frequently abduct rivals with impunity.

""The Libyan Investment Authority is faced with a series of violations and abuses due to blatant interference by armed members of the battalion charged with protecting the tower,"" the LIA said.

""The authority rejects these actions and announces the transfer of its headquarters from Tripoli Tower as a result of security breaches.""

The LIA said staff had been threatened, intimidated and had their movements restricted, and that some employees were abducted and held at a nearby base. Heads of departments were told not to comply with instructions from management.

""The IT manager was forced to suspend the e-mail of the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and the operations manager,"" the LIA statement said.

The LIA was created to invest oil revenues earned before a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi and divided Libya into territory controlled by rival factions.

StanChart entered the DPA with the U.S. Department of Justice and New York County District Attorney's Office in December 2012, accepting that it had broken laws by processing payments for sanctions targets in countries including Iran, Burma, Sudan and Libya.

11401628,2018-06-16,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) called on Saturday for the ""unconditional and immediate"" withdrawal of militia loyal to Ibrahim Jathran from Ras Lanuf and Es Sider terminals, warning of further damage to key infrastructure.

Jathran headed an armed group that blockaded the terminals in Libya's oil crescent for three years before being forced out by the rival Libyan National Army (LNA) led by Khalifa Haftar, the dominant figure in eastern Libya.

The NOC said storage tank 12 in Ras Lanuf had been ""significantly damaged"" in fighting on Thursday, when armed forces linked to Jathran stormed the two ports in an attack against the LNA, causing the ports to close.

The LNA took control of Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and other ports in the oil crescent in September 2016, reopening them and lifting oil production after the blockade that cost Libya tens of billions of dollars in lost oil exports.

The NOC declared force majeure in both ports announcing an initial production loss of 240,000 barrels per day (bpd), which it said was expected to rise to 400,000 bpd if the ports stayed shut.

""NOC calls for the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the militia operating under Ibrahim Jathran to prevent an environmental disaster and further destruction of key infrastructure,"" it said in a statement.

""Further damage to these sites could have a huge impact on the Libyan oil sector and the national economy.""

Since Thursday's attack, the LNA has been sending reinforcements to the oil crescent ahead of a push to recapture the ports, and has launched air strikes against its rivals, military sources and residents said.

""For the past two days the sound of air strikes starts in the night and carries on until the early morning,"" said one resident of Ras Lanuf.

The LNA's rivals had not entered residential areas of Ras Lanuf but were stationed nearby, he said.

Both sides have suffered casualties since Thursday. The Red Crescent humanitarian group in the nearby city of Ajdabiya said 28 bodies from Ras Lanuf and Es Sider had been delivered to the hospital there, without giving details.

The Ras Lanuf resident said three anti-LNA fighters wounded by air strikes had been brought to a hospital in the town.

Jathran said on Thursday he was launching a campaign to recapture the ports in order to ""overturn the injustice"" that he said had been imposed on people in the area by the LNA over the past two years.

The LNA has accused the Benghazi Defense Brigades (BDB), a group of anti-Haftar combatants that has previously tried to take the oil crescent and advance on Benghazi, of participating in Thursday's attack.

Benghazi has been fully controlled by Haftar since late last year.

11401629,2018-05-03,"LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Libya's National Oil Corp (NOC) is withholding Total's share of crude from the Waha concession as a dispute drags on over the French oil major's purchase of Marathon's stake in the concession two months ago, Libyan oil and industry sources said.

Total closed a $450 million deal to buy Marathon Oil's 16.33 percent stake in Waha in March, but the deal drew criticism in Libya and the NOC is currently examining whether to intervene in one way or another.

Total, which has already paid Marathon for the stake, says it informed the Libyan authorities about the deal in advance and they raised no objections at the time.

However, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne has also said the two sides are still in talks on some fiscal issues surrounding the deal.

According to two Libyan oil sources and an industry source with knowledge of the matter, all speaking on condition of anonymity, Total has so far not received any of its share of crude cargoes from Waha.

Total has also not been compensated for the cargoes, one of the sources said.

Total declined to comment. The NOC was not immediately available for comment.

According to a loading programme for Es Sider, the port used for Waha exports, of the fourteen 600,000 or 1 million barrel cargoes planned for May, NOC has ten of them. ConocoPhillips, which has a 16.33 percent stake in Waha, has two cargoes, and Hess, with an 8.16 percent stake, has another two.

Cargoes for the partners in the concession can vary from month to month, with a special department in the NOC deciding on the matter, one of the Libyan oil sources said.

In January, Marathon was allocated two 600,000 barrel cargoes, worth more than $88 million at current prices.

But from the start of this year, Marathon's cargoes have been sold on to oil trader Vitol via NOC, the Libyan oil source and trading sources said. Vitol's deal lasts until at least August, the Libyan source said.

It is not clear whether the change in hands of the Waha concession from Marathon to Total will affect Vitol's contract.

El Feel was shut after guards withdrew from the field to push demands over pay and other benefits earlier this week.

The NOC said force majeure was declared on Friday after ""members of Fazzan group from the Petroleum Facility Guards (PFG) threatened workers, entered the administrative offices in the field, tampered with official papers of the field administration and fired in the air"".

11401633,2018-01-29,"BENGHAZI, Libya, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Libya's eastern-based parliament swore in a new central bank governor on Monday, though the head of a rival assembly in the capital, Tripoli, quickly rejected the move.

The leadership of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) has been divided since 2014, when rival political factions established competing governments in Tripoli and the east of the country.

The eastern-based parliament, or House of Representatives (HOR), set up a parallel central bank in the eastern town of Bayda, voting to dismiss Tripoli governor Sadiq al-Kabir.

After backing Kabir's former deputy Ali Salim al-Hibri to run the bank in Bayda, in December the HOR elected Mohamed Shukri as the new governor.

As he was sworn in on Monday, Shukri spoke of reuniting the CBL and working to emulate the National Oil Corporation (NOC), which has overseen a sharp increase in production despite continuing political divisions.

""Today is the day of unifying the central bank which was divided and that has divided spending and monetary policy,"" Shukri told lawmakers. ""We suffered from problems that you are aware of and we promise to work in the same context as the National Oil Corporation to achieve development and welfare for the Libyan people.""

However, it remains unclear what role Shukri can play since Kabir has shown no sign of leaving his post and has continued to control oil revenues, the source of nearly all Libya's income, as well as most spending across the country.

Abdulrahman Swehli who heads Tripoli's State Council, a rival assembly to the HOR, called the vote ""another jump in the air ... that will be doomed to failure"". There was no immediate comment from the central bank in Tripoli.

Shukri's swearing-in comes as the Libyan dinar has made strong gains on the parallel market, rising to less than five dinars to the dollar in recent days from around nine dinars to the dollar at the end of 2017.

The partial recovery of the dinar may ease some political pressure on Kabir, who has faced growing calls to devalue the dinar from the official rate of 1.3 to the dollar, as the dinar slid in value over the past two years.

Currency traders and economists have attributed the dinar's gains in part to Kabir launching a programme for citizens to claim $500 in foreign currency at the official rate, widening the options for accessing and transferring dollars, and promising to ease restrictions on dollar allowances for importers.

11401908,2018-07-24,"(Repeats July 23 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)

LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have slashed bullish long positions in petroleum at the fastest rate in more than a year, as the gentle profit-taking in previous weeks turned into a rush for the exit.

Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 178 million barrels in the week to July 17.

Net long positions were reduced by the third-largest number of barrels on record, according to an analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges going back to the first quarter of 2013.

The net long position in petroleum was cut below 1 billion barrels for the first time since the middle of September 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2LhKO1S).

The reduction was concentrated on the long side of the market, where positions were slashed by 170 million barrels, as managers took profits after the year-long rally in oil prices.

Short positions rose by just 8 million barrels and remain close to multi-year lows, confirming the shift in net positioning is being driven by profit-taking rather than any newfound bearishness.

Long liquidation was concentrated in Brent, with net long positions in the North Sea benchmark cut by 95 million barrels, the largest one-week reduction since the series began in 2013.

But portfolio managers also cut net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-34 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-17 million barrels) and European gasoil (-25 million barrels).

Hedge fund managers hold most of their positions in futures and options with a relatively short duration to expiry since these tend to offer the most liquidity, so the sell-off has hit near-dated contracts especially hard.

Brent liquidation has therefore crushed the calendar spreads, with contracts nearest to expiry now trading in contango, and the whole of the first six months in a backwardation of less than 40 cents per barrel.

The accelerating sell-off in petroleum futures and options is not entirely surprising and conforms to a common pattern in financial markets.

The sharpest liquidation and price falls come not straight after prices peak, but when prices have been under gentle pressure for some time, and the initial trickle of selling finally turns into a torrent.

Benchmark Brent prices have repeatedly failed to break up through the peak of just over $80 per barrel set in May.

Fund managers are still essentially bullish towards the outlook for oil prices, but the extremely stretched positioning during the first quarter has been partially corrected.

Portfolio managers hold more than eight bullish long positions for every short bearish position in the petroleum complex, but the ratio is down from almost 14:1 in the middle of April.

In Brent, the ratio of hedge fund longs to shorts is down to 8:1, from 20:1 in late April; in European gasoil, the ratio is down to 13:1, from 129:1 in late May.

For most market analysts and traders, the oil market outlook remains fundamentally tight, with strong growth in consumption, while production continues to be disrupted by problems in Venezuela and Libya.

Pipeline capacity shortages in the United States may limit further growth in production from the prolific Permian Basin later in 2018 and early 2019.

On top of all this, U.S. sanctions on Iran threaten to remove millions more barrels from the market from the start of November, though how many remains unclear.

But the sharp rise in output and exports from Saudi Arabia in June and July has increased the availability of crude in the near term, contributing to the sell-off in Brent calendar spreads.

And there are growing concerns about the combined impact of high oil prices, a strengthening dollar and trade tensions on the health of the global economy and oil consumption in the rest of 2018 and 2019.

In the circumstances, many fund managers have chosen to reduce their long exposure to oil, without choosing to go short (yet) in a classic long liquidation cycle.

LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have slashed bullish long positions in petroleum at the fastest rate in more than a year, as the gentle profit-taking in previous weeks turned into a rush for the exit.

Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 178 million barrels in the week to July 17.

Net long positions were reduced by the third-largest number of barrels on record, according to an analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges going back to the first quarter of 2013.

The net long position in petroleum was cut below 1 billion barrels for the first time since the middle of September 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2LhKO1S).

The reduction was concentrated on the long side of the market, where positions were slashed by 170 million barrels, as managers took profits after the year-long rally in oil prices.

Short positions rose by just 8 million barrels and remain close to multi-year lows, confirming the shift in net positioning is being driven by profit-taking rather than any newfound bearishness.

Long liquidation was concentrated in Brent, with net long positions in the North Sea benchmark cut by 95 million barrels, the largest one-week reduction since the series began in 2013.

But portfolio managers also cut net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-34 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-17 million barrels) and European gasoil (-25 million barrels).

Hedge fund managers hold most of their positions in futures and options with a relatively short duration to expiry since these tend to offer the most liquidity, so the sell-off has hit near-dated contracts especially hard.

Brent liquidation has therefore crushed the calendar spreads, with contracts nearest to expiry now trading in contango, and the whole of the first six months in a backwardation of less than 40 cents per barrel.

AGOCO exports from Hariga, one of four terminals where Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) regained control last week after exports were blocked by eastern officials.

Production at AGOCO, an eastern based subsidiary of the NOC, was around 250,000 bpd earlier in the year, though output had fluctuated due to power supply problems.

NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 stock index hit a four-month high on Tuesday, boosted by higher oil prices and strong earnings, while the U.S. dollar rose against the safe-haven Japanese yen as investors bought riskier assets.

World share markets remained near three-week highs, supported by optimism about U.S. company earnings and the notion that global economic growth can withstand trade tensions.

""The first major earnings report came out, and PepsiCo's earnings beat expectations and that's a good start for the market,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

Energy shares were also lifted by oil prices, which rose due to growing supply outages as Norway shut one oilfield amid a worker strike and Libya said production fell by more than half in recent months.

Brent crude - up almost 20 percent this year - was last at $78.71, up 0.82 percent on the day. U.S. crude rose 0.22 percent to $74.01 per barrel.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 128.19 points, or 0.52 percent, to 24,904.78, the S&P 500 gained 7.66 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,791.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.46 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,767.66.

Second-quarter U.S. corporate results start in earnest this week and are expected to showcase earnings growth of over 20 percent across all sectors, thanks to recent tax cuts, high oil prices and robust economic growth.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.41 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.15 percent.

Investors have not forgotten about the underlying potential for an escalated trade war after China and the United States slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's goods. Even so, no fresh salvos have since been fired.

Most analysis suggests that trade measures are not going to have a big impact on global growth, said Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Limited.

""Even if the trade concerns were still there, (investors) would be confronting a better earnings outlook in 2018, so that's another consideration that's keeping risk appetite strong,"" he said.

German export figures and Chinese factory gate prices this week have also offered reassurance on economic momentum.

The risk-on sentiment nudged the U.S. dollar toward a six-month high against the yen, with the greenback poised for a further boost if consumer price inflation figures come in higher than expected on Thursday.

The dollar index rose 0.15 percent, with the euro down 0.18 percent to $1.1728.

In Britain, sterling has been pressured by fears that cabinet resignations could lead to rebellion in the ruling party's ranks, toppling Prime Minister Theresa May or triggering fresh elections.

While this looks unlikely, the uncertainty caused sterling to sink as low as $1.3225 before recovering.

However, a Bank of England rate hike may also support the pound, with markets assigning a roughly 60 percent chance of a 25 basis-point rate hike in August.

LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - OPEC is changing fundamentally as power in the oil market shifts towards Saudi Arabia, acting in concert with Russia, while the other members of the organisation are increasingly marginalised.

In theory, all members of the Organization of the Petroleum Countries are equal, and the group has always taken decisions by consensus (""Statute of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries"", 1961 and 2012).

OPEC's founding statute stipulates that it ""shall be guided by the principle of sovereign equality of its member countries"" (Article 3).

In practice, some members of OPEC have always been more powerful than others, but that imbalance has been widening, with Saudi Arabia becoming the dominant decision-maker.

Saudi Arabia's oil production overtook Iran's in the 1970s, and the gap has grown steadily wider as a result of the Iranian revolution, the Iran-Iraq war and multiple rounds of sanctions.

Saudi Arabia is the only member of the organisation with a large enough share of output to have a measurable influence prices and the budgetary flexibility to adjust its production significantly.

In reality, Saudi Arabia decides how much to produce given market conditions, playing the role of swing producer, while the other members of the organisation essentially produce as much as they are technically able.

Since the late 1990s, Saudi Arabia has increasingly coordinated production policy with neighbouring Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, largely ending their former rivalry and accusations of cheating.

These three Gulf countries have become the core of OPEC, with the other members playing a peripheral role in output policy (tmsnrt.rs/2IwJMbP).

The balance of power within OPEC has been shifting towards Saudi Arabia and its allies for the last 20 years, but production problems in other member countries have accelerated the trend in recent years.

Venezuela's output has fallen sharply as a result of mismanagement and internal unrest. Libya's production has been cut by the country's civil war.

Nigeria and Angola are suffering from chronic production problems. Iran's output has been hampered by repeated rounds of sanctions.

Iraq is the only OPEC member which has experienced a significant increase in output since the country has recovered from the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and ensuing internal security problems.

But Iraq has always attempted to maximise output because of its enormous need for revenues to meet heavy budget commitments and it plays little practical role in OPEC's production policy.

Since 2011, Saudi Arabia and its key allies have consistently accounted for around 48-49 percent of total OPEC output (""Statistical Review of World Energy"", BP, 2018).

More importantly, Saudi Arabia and its allies account for almost all the organisation's spare production capacity and therefore almost all its production flexibility.

Saudi Arabia and its allies accounted for most of the voluntary production cuts implemented during 2017/18 and now hold most of the spare capacity that could be made available to the market in 2018/19.

Saudi Arabia has around 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of unused output capacity, while the UAE has around 330,000 bpd and Kuwait around 220,000, according to the International Energy Agency.

Most other members of the organisation have only negligible amounts of unused capacity that could be readily and reliably available to the market (""Oil Market Report"", IEA, June 2018).

And among the three Gulf allies, Saudi Arabia has by far the largest production and unused capacity, cementing its role as the de facto leader of OPEC.

OPEC's biggest problem in attempting to manage the oil market has always been its inability to control production from countries which remain outside the organisation.

OPEC's efforts to stabilise and raise prices have frequently been undermined by the growth of alternative sources of supply (Alaska, China, the Soviet Union, the North Sea and now the shale fields of North America).

Saudi Arabia, as OPEC leader, has made repeated overtures to non-OPEC countries since the mid-1980s to restrain their production, with uneven success.

Since 2016, however, Saudi Arabia has forged an effective working relationship with Russia and a group of other, smaller non-OPEC producers to limit output.

Just as Saudi Arabia has dominated OPEC, Russia dominates the group of non-OPEC allies, contributing most of the output, production cuts and spare capacity.

In effect, Saudi Arabia and Russia have emerged as joint market managers, with other OPEC and non-OPEC countries relegated to a marginal role.

OPEC is no longer the primary decision-making forum for producing countries trying to coordinate policy on output and prices.

Real decision-making power has passed from OPEC and its group of allies into the hands of Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Saudi Arabia and Russia have been careful to maintain the formal involvement of OPEC and the wider group of countries, known as OPEC+.

But the real decisions on production policy are now being made bilaterally and outside the OPEC and OPEC+ structures.

The marginalisation of OPEC as a formal decision-making group was evident during the organisation's meetings in Vienna between June 20 and June 23.

Despite four days of discussions, OPEC and OPEC+ failed to reach a detailed agreement on production policy in the second half of 2018.

The final communiques issued after the OPEC and OPEC+ meetings did not specify either a formal output ceiling or country allocations.

Instead, it was left to Saudi and Russian officials to brief the media afterwards that collective output would increase by around 1 million bpd.

Saudi Arabia and Russia will contribute almost all the increase in output, with smaller contributions from Kuwait and the UAE.

In theory, this decision was taken by consensus among OPEC and non-OPEC members, with Iran and other members persuaded to give their assent to a vague joint statement.

In practice, Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to have increased their production by 1 million bpd, whether other OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed or not.

If Iran or any other country had walked out of the discussions, it would not have made any practical difference to the amount of oil supplied to the market in the second half of 2018.

Saudi Arabia is keen to maintain the formal structure of OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation; the consensus outcome of the meetings was an important step towards that objective.

But the preservation of the OPEC+ group masks the fact real power in the oil market has shifted decisively to Saudi Arabia and Russia, with some political input from the United States.

Saudi and Russian market power will become even more evident in the second half of 2018, if the two countries proceed with the agreed increase in production.

Assuming Saudi Arabia and its two Gulf allies increase their combined production by 700,000-800,000 bpd, their share of total OPEC output will climb above 50 percent for the first time since the mid-1990s.

And if Venezuela's output continues to fall, which seems likely, and Iran's production is curbed by U.S. sanctions, the three Gulf allies will see their share of OPEC output climb to the highest level since 1981.

By 2019, the oil market will have less than 1 million bpd of spare production capacity, essentially all of it located in Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia will exercise more market power than at any time since the Iranian revolution and Iraq's invasion caused Iranian output to plummet in 1980/81.

Market power will be in the hands of Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, not OPEC or the broader OPEC+ group.

The formal structures of OPEC and OPEC+ decision-making will remain, but real power has shifted elsewhere.

11401914,2018-06-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as plunging U.S. crude stockpiles compounded supply worries in a market already uncertain about Libyan exports, a production disruption in Canada and Washington's demands that importers stop buying Iranian crude from November.

Little spare capacity remains to offset any further production disruptions, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management.

""The bulls will run the table and are going to be helped out by random events that will come out of left field and keep this thing going,"" Kilduff said.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose $2.23, or 3.16 percent, to settle at $72.76 a barrel. The contract touched $73.06 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 28, 2014. Brent crude LCOc1 rose $1.31, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $77.62 a barrel.

Both contracts pared gains in post-settlement trade. U.S. crude was up $1.77 at $72.30 a barrel and Brent trading up 90 cents at $77.21 a barrel by 3:51 p.m. EDT (1951 GMT).

Because prices gained sharply for two straight sessions, some long positions were exiting the market to capitalize on the move as the end of the quarter approaches, said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital in Laurel Hollow, New York.

U.S. crude stocks fell nearly 10 million barrels last week, the most since Sept. 2016, while gasoline and distillate inventories rose less than expected, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S]

Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for the NYMEX futures contract fell 2.7 million barrels, EIA said. USOICC=ECI

""Cushing is a whopper,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.

The reported Cushing draw reflected just one day of a production disruption at a supplier in Canada. Syncrude's oil sands facility was offline at least through July, after a power outage last week locked in 350,000 bpd.

""Next week, you're going to have a Cushing storage number that includes seven days of the Syncude outage. The math there would imply that you'd get an even bigger draw than this week,"" Yawger said.

The front-month U.S. crude contract traded at $4.67 above the sixth-month contract CLc1-CLc6, the most since July 2014. This encourages further drawdowns from storage.

The fall in Canadian exports helped drain supplies of heavy crude across North America, analysts said. They also cited concern about the risk of a disruption to supplies from Africa and the Middle East.

In Libya, a power struggle has left it unclear whether the internationally recognized government or rebels will handle oil exports. The future of Iranian crude exports was also in doubt. The United States has told all countries to stop importing Iranian oil from November.

Trying to make up for disrupted supply, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said last week it would increase output.

Saudi Arabia plans to pump a record 11 million bpd in July, up from 10.8 million bpd in June, an industry source familiar with Saudi plans told Reuters on Tuesday.

Despite widespread international opposition to the U.S. stance on Iran, analysts expect a significant reduction in exports from OPEC's third biggest producer, perhaps in excess of 1 million bpd.

Iran pumped 3.8 million bpd in May, Reuters' monthly survey showed [OPEC/O].

Goldman Sachs said the planned unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran would likely have a ""high level of efficiency.""

Risk consultancy Eurasia Group said: ""We are increasing our estimate of oil likely to come off the market by November to about 700,000 bpd -- another bullish factor for prices.""

11401915,2018-06-26,"BENGHAZI, Libya/TUNIS (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar's forces have handed control of oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the east, a spokesman said on Monday, a move the internationally recognized NOC in Tripoli dismissed as illegal.

If implemented, the transfer of control would create uncertainty for buyers of Libyan oil who normally go through NOC Tripoli. It could also deepen the split between east and west Libya, which have been home to rival governments since 2014.

In comments later confirmed to Reuters, Ahmed Mismari, spokesman of Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA), said on television that no tanker would be allowed to dock at eastern ports without permission from an NOC entity based in the main eastern city, Benghazi.

Mismari said the move was to prevent oil revenues being used to fund militias such as ""Chadian mercenaries"", and because of a lack of recognition from the chairman of NOC Tripoli, Mustafa Sanalla, for the ""sacrifices"" of LNA troops guarding the ports.

Armed forces allied to Ibrahim Jathran, a faction leader, briefly seized the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf oil ports this month until the LNA expelled his troops last week. The LNA says fighters from Chad helped Jathran.

Mismari said 184 LNA soldiers had been killed and dozens of others wounded in five attacks on the ports, which have been repeatedly fought over by rival factions.

When asked how oil exports would be sold in the future via the east, he referred questions to NOC in Benghazi, which is not recognized abroad. Faraj Said, head of the Benghazi NOC, said his office was planning to issue instructions to oil companies to start work.

""We are legitimate,"" Said told Reuters. ""Whoever wants to do business with us is welcome.""

NOC Tripoli said in a statement that the LNA had ""decided to put itself above the law"", and any attempts by parallel institutions to export oil were illegal and would fail as they had failed in the past.

""NOC warns companies against entering into contracts to buy oil from parallel institutions,"" it said. ""They will not be honoured and NOC will pursue legal action against them by all options available.""

Haftar's forces control most of eastern Libya, home to a largely powerless parallel government, central bank and NOC entity opposing the U.N.-backed administration in the capital, Tripoli. Eastern factions have long accused the central bank in Tripoli of misspending oil revenues and allocating insufficient funds to the east.

A spokesman for the eastern government said its prime minister and central bank had met on Monday to discuss how to start managing oil revenues.

The eastern government tried in 2015 to sell oil bypassing NOC Tripoli, but did not find buyers, banks or insurers willing to take the legal risk. Western powers and U.N. Security Council resolutions have protected NOC Tripoli as the sole body that can market and sell Libyan oil.

The fate of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, two of Libya's largest ports, is crucial to the fragile recovery of the country's oil industry. Their closure has led to production losses of up to 450,000 barrels per day from a total national output of a little over 1 million bpd.

The Hariga port in Tobruk near the Egyptian border as well as the Brega and Zueitina terminals southwest of Benghazi are also under Haftar's control.

In 2013, Jathran seized and blockaded several eastern oil ports. In March 2014, U.S. Navy SEALS seized a tanker that had loaded crude from one of the ports, and in 2016, Jathran lost control to the LNA. The LNA handed the terminals to NOC Tripoli, allowing Libya's production and exports to rise sharply.",Reuters,energy,,"['Benghazi', 'Tripoli', 'Libya', 'Chad', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Brega', 'Tobruk', 'Egypt']",East Libyan forces say oil ports handed to eastern-based NOC,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-oil-idUSKBN1JL2DQ,None,
11401916,2018-04-12,"LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - OPEC on Thursday revised its forecast for supply growth from its rivals for 2018 by nearly three times more than its revised projection of growth in global oil demand.

It said growth in non-OPEC oil supply was forecast to rise by a further 80,000 barrels per day this year to 1.71 million bpd, driven largely by higher-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter in the United States and the former Soviet Union.

At the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year by 30,000 bpd to 1.63 million bpd.

""This mainly reflects the positive momentum in the OECD in the 1Q18 on the back of better-than-expected data, and supported by development in industrial activities, colder-than-anticipated weather and strong mining activities in the OECD Americas and the OECD Asia Pacific,"" it said in its monthly market report.

The 14-member, Vienna-based producer group said its collective output according to secondary sources fell by 201,000 bpd to 31.96 million bpd in March from February, driven by declines in Angola, Algeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Libya.

Production in the United Arab Emirates posted the largest month-on-month increase, according to the secondary sources, rising by around 45,000 bpd in March to 2.86 million bpd.

OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia told the group it pumped 9.907 million bpd in March, 28,000 bpd below its February level.

Venezuela reported production of 1.509 million bpd in March, 77,000 bpd below the level it reported in February.

OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014.

The pact runs until the end of the year and OPEC meets in Vienna in June to decide on its next course of action.

Oil stocks in the developed world reversed a rise in January to fall by 17.4 million barrels in February to 2.854 billion barrels, around 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average, OPEC said.

Stock levels are 207 million barrels below their level in February 2017.

11401917,2018-03-06,"TUNIS, March 5 (Reuters) - Two of Libya's largest oilfields with combined production of nearly 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) have suffered shutdowns in quick succession, casting fresh doubt on a partial recovery in the OPEC member's oil output.

Libya's national output has been sustained at about one million bpd for months, and most recent closures have been quickly resolved. A shutdown that began on Sunday at El Sharara, Libya's biggest field, lasted less than 24 hours.

But the latest disruptions - caused by guards at El Feel field complaining about pay and benefits, and by a property owner who said he wanted rubbish cleared from his land - highlight continuing risks to output in a country without centralised security forces or political control.

Libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in Africa, and has been a key supplier of light, sweet crude to Europe.

Around 1970 it produced more than 3 million bpd, and before the NATO-backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago, it was pumping more than 1.6 million bpd.

Last year the state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) outlined plans that would raise production to 2.2 million bpd by 2023, but said this would need around $18 billion of investment.

Foreign oil companies including Italy's Eni, Total of France and U.S. firms ConocoPhillips and Hess have production stakes through joint ventures with the NOC.

Since Libya's 2011 uprising, power in the sparsely populated nation has fragmented and local groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands.

Armed factions across the country have cut off production at key fields and ports, including a long blockade of terminals in Libya's eastern oil crescent from 2014-2016. Prolonged and haphazard shutdowns have reduced pressure at oil wells.

As Libya's revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices, demands for salaries, local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread.

Islamic State militants attacked oilfields and ports in 2015-2016 before being driven back by local forces. Their destruction of storage tanks at two of Libya's biggest terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, has yet to be repaired. Fields including Mabruk and Ghani remain closed.

After disputed elections in 2014 led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east, eastern-based factions tried to sell oil independently. They failed, but the split added to uncertainty in Libya's oil sector.

The causes of recent shutdowns include economic protests by guards, armed groups pushing for the release of jailed members, and apparent political manoeuvring in the east.

Sometimes shutdowns are triggered in remote fields or at terminals, sometimes by people with access to gearboxes that control pipeline valves. Production at the key Sharara field has repeatedly been cut on the long pipeline leading to the coast by groups near Zintan, a western town that became militarily powerful in the 2011 uprising.

The internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, which lacks authority over armed groups even in the capital, often has little means of ending blockades.

Oil installations are meant to be protected by the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG). But as with other parts of Libya's security forces, their official status is effectively self-declared and their actions are governed by local interests rather than any central authority.

Even as longer blockades ended from mid-2016, financial constraints have been an underlying drag on Libya's production rebound. The NOC has had rocky relations with the GNA, and has complained repeatedly that budget allocations have been held up. The GNA says its own resources are limited.

A bigger political risk also looms. Factions in the east, where most of Libya's oil wealth is located, are opposed to the GNA and say it has not disbursed sufficient oil income to eastern regions. Some eastern hardliners have threatened to cut oil production although for now the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which has good relations with the NOC in Tripoli, has kept fields and ports open.

Security is still volatile. In December an explosion at a pipeline in eastern Libya caused an outage of up to 100,000 bpd, though it was quickly repaired. International companies are working offshore but still have a limited presence onshore, keeping exploration and development programmes mostly on hold.

Along with Nigeria, Libya has been exempted from OPEC-led production cuts that seek to bolster crude prices and have been extended until the end of 2018.

11401919,2018-02-19,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) is suffering ongoing delays in receiving budget money from the government and this could reduce production, the head of the state company said on Monday.

Mustafa Sanalla made the comments after meeting the head of Al Jouf Oil Technology Company, who said the NOC subsidiary was suffering from financial problems that had delayed projects and salary payments.

""The entire sector is suffering from these problems because of delays in the finance ministry disbursing budgets to the corporation for this year,"" Sanalla said in a statement from the NOC.

""This slowdown will create negative consequences for the whole sector leading to a large decline in the level of production once more and a negative impact on development projects in the oil sector.""

The NOC, which has raised Libya's oil production to more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from lows of around 200,000 bpd in 2016, receives its budget through the central bank and the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.

Sanalla has repeatedly complained in the past about late and partial budget payments, which he says have hampered output.

11401922,2018-01-05,"TUNIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Libya earned $14 billion in oil revenues in 2017, nearly three times more than in the previous year, allowing it to halve its budget deficit, the central bank said, amid a partial recovery in oil output despite continued political and economic turmoil.

Libya's budget deficit for 2017 stood at 10.6 billion Libyan dinars ($7.85 billion), down from 20.3 billion dinars the previous year, the bank said in statement published late on Thursday. Oil revenues had totalled $4.8 billion in 2016.

Its oil earnings accounted for more than 86 percent of Libya's total national revenues of 22.31 billion dinars.

Of 32.7 billion dinars worth of state spending, 20.3 billion dinars went on state salaries and 6 billion dinars on subsidies, the statement said.

The figures show the partial recovery last year in oil production slightly slowing the otherwise rapid economic decline of a nation still dogged by armed conflict and political upheaval more than seven years after the overthrow of veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Economists say it is unclear to what extent the central bank's figures fully reflect economic activity, because the institution has been split for several years between its Tripoli headquarters and a rival branch loyal to a government based in eastern Libya.

The Tripoli central bank said its figures did not include 22 billion dinars of what it regards as unauthorised spending by the central bank in the east.

Libya has been divided since 2014 between rival institutions and warring factions based in the east and west.

However, the central bank in Tripoli has continued to control oil revenues, which account for nearly all the country's income, and to disburse them across the country.

Oil production, in decline from 2013, recovered to around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) last year, but this is still well below the more than 1.6 million bpd Libya was pumping before the 2011 uprising.

Living standards have dropped sharply, with inflation running at around 30 percent and the dinar slipping on the black market to around 9 dinars to the dollar.

Foreign reserves have fallen to an estimated $67.5 billion, compared to $123.5 billion in 2012, according to the World Bank.

The central bank said in November it had agreed on currency and spending reforms with the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, but it is unclear when the plan will be carried out.

11402020,2018-12-22,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya and Turkey agreed on Saturday to open an urgent joint investigation into a consignment of arms which arrived from Turkey and was seized at a port near Tripoli this week, the UN-backed Libyan government said.

The government released the statement following talks in Tripoli between Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.

The statement quoted Cavusoglu as saying Ankara rejected such actions ""which do not represent the policy or approach of the Turkish state"".

The weapons were seized by customs on Tuesday in Khoms port, just over 100 km (62 miles) east of Tripoli.

The consignment sent from Turkey contained 3,000 Turkish-made pistols, as well as some other pistols, hunting rifles and ammunition, Benghazi's Benina airport customs services said on their official Facebook account.

A day earlier a cargo of 2.5 million Turkish-made bullets was seized at the same port, the same source said.

The UN mission in Libya has condemned the shipment of arms to Libya as ""extremely disconcerting.""

The UN last June extended an arms embargo on Libya for another year.

The oil-rich country plunged into chaos nearly eight years after a NATO-backed uprising that toppled former Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi.

11402021,2018-10-29,"REMADA, Tunisia (Reuters) - Tunisian Zubair Abdel-Moula lost his work selling smuggled fuel on the streets of a poor southern town after the government tightened controls with Libya to stop militants crossing the 460km (286 miles) border.

The 32-year-old, who has never had a full-time job, now sits on a mattress blocking traffic in Remada's main street with other unemployed protestors, demanding state jobs and aid.

Tunisia started digging trenches and setting up monitoring systems provided by Western allies on the Libyan border in 2015.

Routes that had been used for decades to smuggle cheap fuel, pasta and wheat from Libya to Tunisia, were also being used by Islamic militants and to transport drugs and arms.

Officials say shutting the routes has helped prevent a repeat of attacks such as the one in 2015 when a Libyan-trained Tunisian shot dead dozens of tourists on a Tunisian beach.

But the crackdown took the livelihood of thousands, many of whom have joined the protests. The growing dissent is a worry for the government, the ninth since the Arab Spring and the 2011 fall of leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, as it clings to power.

""We won't go,"" said Abdel-Moula. ""I don't hope of things getting better.""

Southern Tunisia sits on the oil and phosphate that drive the overall economy but the good jobs in those sectors rarely go to locals who often lack engineering skills. The area around Remada is poorer than the capital Tunis, 600 km to the north.

""The south provides everything for Tunisia. There are foreign companies making money here but we locals can't get jobs at oilfields."" said Abdel-Moula.

Fellow protestor Abdullah used to spend his nights in remote borderlands buying fuel from Libyan truck drivers to sell in Remada. Due to subsidies, the pump price of petrol in Libya is ten times cheaper than in Tunisia.

With the crackdown, the work has become too dangerous.

""I used to have a fuel (distribution) station with seven other families to buy (Libyan) fuel but it has become too dangerous,"" said Abdullah, asking not to use his full name.

Western countries have praised Tunisia as the only democratic success of the Arab Spring. It transitioned to democracy after toppling long-serving leader Ben-Ali without triggering widespread violence or civil war.

It has held free elections and in 2014 approved a constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights in contrast to autocratic systems and turmoil elsewhere in region.

But the succession of governments since Ben Ali's overthrow has been unable to resolve deep-rooted economic problems. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed is fighting for survival with his coalition locked in a row about how to reform the economy.

Investors have been scared away from North Africa by turmoil in Libya, inflation hit 7.4 percent in September, the highest since 1990, and the jobless rate is 15 percent.

In the southern province of Tataouine, which includes Remada and much of the Libyan border, unemployment is 32 percent.

""We have a problem with unemployment,"" said Governor Adel Ouerghi. ""Most of our youth want to work (on oilfields) in the desert because salaries are high there.""

Many Tunisians used to cross the border to work in Libya but now feel the country is too dangerous.

""If the situation was stable 300,000 to 400,000 could find work there,"" he said.

Tunisia tolerated the smuggling for decades as a way to help the south which missed out on industries concentrated mostly in the north and eastern coast.

Some 3,000 Tunisians have joined Islamic State and other extremists in Libya, Syria and Iraq, many of which came from the south or equally neglected central hinterland.

But the chaos in Libya led to a spike in arrivals of militants, drugs and weapons, diplomats say, forcing the government to act.

Libya's state oil firm, NOC, was also keen for a crackdown. It estimates the smuggling cost the economy at least $750 million each year.

""We think most of the fuel goes to Tunisia and to Europe via Malta,"" NOC said in a statement. ""Some local economies have become oriented around smuggling and this affects the fabric of communities who become dependent on criminal activity.""

The smuggling has also caused fuel shortages in some Libyan towns, officials say.

""It has been also agreed with other towns and tribes to disassociate all those involved in smuggling,"" said Mustafa al-Barouni, mayor of Zintan, a western Libyan town.

Tunisian officials say it will be impossible to stop smuggling completely.

The border can't be sealed in mountain regions and some Tunisian guards, often related to smugglers, look the other way for a bribe, residents say.

Fuel stalls seen by Reuters on the road between Remada and the provincial capital Tataouine were abandoned but some youths were still selling gasoline, even on the same street as the governor's office.

But for the protesters too many people have lost their livelihood.

""Thousands of families depend on this,"" said Salem Bounhas, secretary general of the powerful labor union UGTT in Tataouine.

The protestors have threatened to escalate road blocks to cut off access to oil refineries unless the government finds them other work.

The government has focused too much on closing borders without dealing with unemployment, said Chloe Teevan, a North Africa researcher at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

11402022,2018-07-21,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's parliament voted on Friday to bar the government from signing bilateral agreements with other European Union countries on readmitting migrants who arrived in Europe via the Black Sea state.

The national assembly took the step after Prime Minister Boyko Borissov asked parliamentary groups to adopt a joint decision on curbing migration.

The resolution was backed by 177 lawmakers in the 240-seat parliament, which also decided that Borissov's government should present a Bulgarian proposal by the end of September on reforming the Dublin Regulation on how European nations handle asylum requests.

Last month, EU leaders reached a hard-fought accord on migration, but the details were vague and the leaders agreed to share out refugees arriving in the bloc only on a voluntary basis.

Borissov said that it was no coincidence that the migrant crisis had ""split Europe"" and that no one had been prepared.

""There is an undeniable fact that to date Bulgaria is the only country in the EU to deal (properly) with migrants, there is almost zero (migrant) pressure, and it is seen as an example,"" he said in parliament.

He said he had turned down an Italian plea to accept some of the migrants Italy helped rescue from an overcrowded boat in the Mediterranean on Saturday.

Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said once migrant inflows were stemmed, the EU should deal with the thousands of migrants already in Europe, taking care of people fleeing conflict and sending the rest home.

""I will insist on the immediate closure of the external borders of the whole European Union,"" Borissov said in a surprise visit to parliament, following an opposition call for information on Bulgaria's position on migration.

He said centers should be set up in Libya and Turkey to deal with migrants before they reached Europe.

Bulgaria, which holds the European Union presidency, hopes that by halting migrant inflows the bloc may also ease the concerns of Central European countries that are opposing calls to accept a quota of migrants who have entered the EU since 2015 in order to share the burden around the bloc.

""Their fear is that there are no guarantees that this process will not continue,"" Borissov said.

He said he would hold talks again with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the issue.

On Thursday, leaders of the Visegrad Four countries Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic said they would skip the smaller summit on Sunday ahead of a full 28-member EU summit next week.

11402025,2018-03-07,"KASSEL, Germany (Reuters) - BASF's oil and gas subsidiary Wintershall announced plans on Wednesday to expand into Brazil's growing offshore oil sector as part of a drive to boost sales and profit this year.

Chief executive Mario Mehren told reporters his company, which is due to merge with Russian-owned German rival DEA [RWEDE.UL], would compete in upcoming offshore licensing rounds in Brazil, possibly with partners.

""We have been very Norway-focused which is good, but we want to have another area of exploration success,"" he said.

""The Brazilian coastline is viewed as one of the world's most promising oil regions,"" he added.

Wintershall's assets so far stretch from oil field concessions in Libya to subsea fields in the North Sea and to Russia's Arctic regions.

It has studied geological data and is ready to co-operate in various arrangements for various assets in Brazil, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, Mehren said.

Foreign companies such as Exxon and Statoil, as well as Brazilian firms, could be open to partnerships, he added.

For Wintershall, Brazil would add to its activities in Russia, Argentina, Norway, Libya and Germany. Across the world last year, it repeated 2016's record output of 165 billion cubic meters (bcm) of oil equivalent (boe).

Wintershall expects significant rises in sales and earnings before special items in 2018, after increasing both steeply in 2017, thanks to higher volumes and higher commodity prices.

Oil prices last year increased 23 percent to $54 per barrel on average for North Sea grade Brent. Wintershall's internal company planning is based on an average price of $65 this year and an exchange rate of $1.2 per euro.

It also sees gas prices remaining at current levels in north-western Europe in 2018, after spot gas at European trading hubs rose 24 percent last year.

The merger with DEA, which BASF said last week would likely close by the end of the third quarter, will bring synergies in German and Norwegian oil and gas ventures where the two operate separately, and in administration costs, Mehren said.

This would likely affect the two headquarters at Kassel and Hamburg, Mehren said, mentioning that Frankfurt, Germany's business capital, could become an option for moving certain operations.

11402026,2018-01-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - A French businessman suspected by investigators of funneling money from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to finance Nicolas Sarkozy's successful 2007 presidential campaign was granted bail when he appeared at a London court on Wednesday.

Alexandre Djouhri, 58, was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport on Sunday on a European arrest warrant (EAW) issued by France after arriving on a flight from Switzerland.

London's Westminster Magistrates Court heard Djouhri was wanted by the French authorities over nine allegations, including use of a fake document, active corruption of a foreign public official, conspiracy to misappropriate public funds and three charges of money laundering.

England's Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said the accusations related to ""very serious allegations of corruption"" although his lawyer said Djouhri, who holds joint French and Algerian nationality, would fight extradition, arguing the case was politically motivated.

Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has always denied receiving any illicit campaign funding and has dismissed the Libyan allegations as ""grotesque"". Investigations into the 2007 campaign are ongoing and it is not yet known whether a trial will take place.

Sarkozy has been ordered to stand trial in a separate campaign finance investigation related to events in 2012, when he ran for a second term but was defeated by Francois Hollande.

As president, Sarkozy hosted Muammar Gaddafi for a lavish five-day visit in 2007 during which the former Libyan leader, then rekindling ties with Western powers after years of being ostracized, hosted visitors in a tent pitched for him in the garden of an official residence for important foreign visitors.

But in 2011 Sarkozy sent French forces to Libya as part of an international coalition following the Arab Spring uprising, resulting in the ousting and death of Gadaffi.

""In response the Gaddafi family, and particularly his son from custody, began making ... wild allegations that the Gaddafi family had funded President Sarkozy's campaign in 2007,"" Djouhri's lawyer Mark Summers told the London court.

He said the French inquiry, which began in 2013, had looked at suggestions ""bags of cash"" were brought from Libya to France but so far it had resulted in no charges being brought.

""As far as the main allegations are concerned, the understanding is that there hasn't been any evidence uncovered,"" Summers told the court.

Djouhri, who lives in Geneva and is a company director of a firm that deals with sanitation, water treatment and solar energy, had developed connections with Libya and North Africa and his expertise had been called upon by the French authorities since the 1990s, the court was told.

He was acquainted with Dominique de Villepin, who served as both foreign minister and prime minister between 2002 and 2007. A Reuters photo from 2014 shows Djouhri sitting next to Villepin at a soccer match in Paris.

Sitting impassively in the dock, bespectacled and wearing a suit, Djouhri listened as Summers said there were four substantive grounds on which extradition would be opposed.

Summers said there was an ""overtly political genesis"" to the allegations, the French inquiry was yet to charge anyone, the warrant issued by France was insufficient and he questioned the state of French prisons.

Djouhri, who earns about 200,000 pounds a year, was granted bail on condition that he pays security of one million pounds ($1.35 million), after Arbuthnot rejected an initial offer of 200,000 pounds, saying there needed to be a ""really substantial security"".

He must also wear an electronic tagging device, remain in a specified area of London and report to police daily, while his passports and ID cards have already been seized.

Under the deal signed on Wednesday, OMV gains access to the Middle East gas business for the first time, in line with its strategy to make it a core region to balance geopolitical risks it faces in countries such as Russia and Libya.

OMV, which brings in extensive experience in seismic, drilling and engineering work, will contribute 5 percent of the project capital and operational development expenses, the companies said without giving an overall value for the deal.

The Ghasha project consists of three major gas and condensate development projects - Hail, Ghasha and Dalma - as well as other offshore oil, gas and condensate fields, including Nasr, SARB and Mubarraz.

OMV joins Germany's Wintershall, a unit of BASF, and Italy's Eni, which hold a 10 percent and 25 percent respectively in the ADNOC-operated project.

The fields are expected to produce at least 1.5 billion cubic feet per day when they come on stream around the middle of the next decade, enough to provide electricity to more than two million homes, according to ADNOC.

The fields are also expected to produce more than 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

""With this agreement, we are expanding our already material position in the Middle East and are further shifting our upstream production towards gas,"" OMV Chief Executive Rainer Seele said in a statement.

The group agreed this year to pay ADNOC $1.5 billion for a 40-year concession for a 20 percent stake in the SARB and Umm Lulu offshore oil fields.

""This is a somber day,"" Nelke Mander, Medecins sans Frontieres's general director, said in a statement. ""The end of our operations onboard the Aquarius will mean more death in the sea, deaths that are avoidable and without witnesses.""

The decision to moor the Aquarius is the result of a ""constant denigration, smearing and obstruction campaign led"" against Medecins sans Frontieres and SOS MEDITERRANEAN by the Italian government and supported by other European countries, the NGO said.

The Aquarius was recently accused of trafficking waste and criminal activities -- accusations that are ""ludicrous"", Medecins sans Frontieres said.

Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has repeatedly closed Italian ports to the Aquarius, forcing it to sail for days with dozens of rescued migrants aboard to find a port in other countries.

Salvini has refused to take more migrants from the Aquarius, demanding other European Union countries take a share of migrants. He also said the rescue ships like Aquarius encouraged people to take the sea to cross towards Europe.

Europe has seen the biggest influx of people for decades in the past three years, many fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. Sea arrivals have dropped sharply, but the political aftershocks are still reverberating.

The ship was commissioned in February 2016 and has rescued almost 30,000 people in international waters off Libya, Malta and Italy. She has remained moored on Marseilles since Oct. 4, after transferring 58 migrants on Malta during her last mission.

11402104,2018-12-03,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Assane Diallo is making final preparations for a journey he knows could cost him his life: one thousand miles across open ocean from Senegal to the Canary Islands in a 50-foot wooden boat held together with rusty nails.

The 35-year-old fisherman hopes to push off this week from a beach in the capital Dakar with water, dried food and potentially dozens of passengers. He just needs two motors and enough petrol for the week-long journey and also to patch up a three-foot (1 meter) gash in the hull.

Diallo is part of a resurgence in African migrants taking the treacherous Atlantic route to the Spanish territory this year in search of jobs and prosperity that they cannot find at home.

Many migrants see the chain of islands off the Moroccan coast as the only viable option left as the European Union spends millions of dollars cutting off land routes through north Africa. They consider it a launchpad for asylum in mainland Europe.

""Some, if they see a canoe, do not even consider staying here. They will leave at all costs,"" said Diallo, looking over the litter-strewn beach where listless teenagers mill about at dusk, some fixing fishing nets or painting boats in bright reds and blues.

Over 1,200 migrants arrived in the Canary Islands between Jan. 1 and Nov. 14, Spanish Interior Ministry data show, the highest in nine years and a four-fold increase over the same period in 2017.

It marks the revival of a worrying trend. In 2006 - when 30,000 migrants managed to reach the Canary Islands - some 7,000 people died trying to make the crossing, rights groups say. In the decade that followed, Spanish patrols slowed the pace. Land routes through Niger and Libya to Italy became more popular.

But the Italian government has focused on stopping the Libya route. With migrants detained in slave-like conditions in Libya, the numbers arriving in Italy have dropped off dramatically from a peak of 181,000 in 2016.

Still, migrants' will to leave remains. The fall in arrivals to Italy has corresponded with a surge in attempts to reach Spain, where a record number of migrants has reached the mainland in recent months.

""Managing... migratory flows is very much like squeezing a balloon. When one route closes, the flows increase on another,"" said Izabella Cooper, spokeswoman for EU border agency Frontex.

""The only solution to migration is to eliminate the root causes: wars and poverty.""

Migrants face many dangers on the open ocean, including mountainous waves, blistering heat and starvation.

While the numbers remain small compared to arrivals on the Spanish mainland, authorities in Senegal and Gambia said there has been a rise in boats attempting the crossing to the Canary Islands this year.

The lack of data on departures makes it impossible to calculate how many die.

In October, Guinea Bissau's coastguard discovered the empty wreckage of a boat that had been carrying dozens of migrants. That same month, a boat with 72 Gambians and Senegalese heading for the Canary Islands was rescued off Guinea Bissau after an engine failure.

One of the migrants, Alieu Gaye, said he went by boat because he heard that land routes had become too dangerous.

""People are afraid to take the road. They prefer to take canoes to travel by the Atlantic Ocean,"" he said.

Policing a coastline hundreds of miles long is a tough task, coast guards say.

Spain's Guardia Civil has worked with the Senegalese Coast Guard since 2006 to intercept migrants. They have two 100-foot boats, one of which goes out every day, but crew members say they rarely find anything.

""The sea is very, very big. And they can leave from wherever in Senegal, Gambia or further south,"" said Rafael Carballo Abeger, an attache at the Spanish embassy in Dakar.

Assane Diallo is confident he can evade the coast guard when he leaves before dawn in the coming days. It is worth the risk, he says. Fish stocks are depleting and he can no longer provide for his wife and two children.

11402105,2018-11-23,"GENEVA (Reuters) - At least 631 African migrants have died trying to reach Spain so far this year, nearly three times more than in all of 2017, and the situation has become ""alarming"", the U.N. migration agency said on Friday.

More than 120 migrants, from North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, have arrived in Spain each day during November, following a record month in October with over 350 per day, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

""This is usually a time of slowing down on these routes, that is not happening in Spain,"" IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a news briefing.

Migrants are using smaller and less seaworthy boats, he said.

About two dozen migrants drowned off the coast of Cadiz in November, he said. The sole survivor of another shipwreck, a teenage boy from Guinea now in hospital with severe hypothermia, told rescuers that he was traveling with nine others including his brother in an inflatable row boat from Tangiers, Morocco.

The arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants into Europe has fueled the rise of far-right parties across the continent in recent years, although numbers have fallen over the past three years. Many thousands of people, mostly from Africa and the Middle East, have drowned at sea.

So far this year 104,506 migrants have arrived by sea in Europe and 2,075 have perished, according to the IOM's latest figures. Both figures are about two-thirds of last year's totals and around a quarter of the totals from 2016.

But while traffic on the main sea route from Libya to Italy has fallen sharply over the past year, in part due to agreements with Libyan armed groups to fight smuggling, travel has increased across the western Mediterranean to Spain.

The route from Turkey to Greece, used by more than a million asylum seekers in 2015, was largely shut by an EU agreement with Turkey the following year.

In addition to migrants arriving by sea in mainland Spain, Millman said 36 migrants had died trying to reach the Canary Islands this year, compared to just one last year, Millman said.

11402106,2018-11-14,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Migrants refusing to leave a cargo ship docked in Libya said on Wednesday they would rather die than be returned to land, as the coast guard began disembarking some of those on board.

In the first documented case of its kind, the migrants have been stranded on the ship since it intercepted them off Libya's western coast on Saturday and brought them to the port of Misrata.

A Sudanese on board, Biktor, said his brother and friend had both died at the hands of smugglers in Bani Walid, a smuggling hub south of Tripoli.

""How come you want me to leave the ship and stay in Libya?"" the 17-year-old said. ""We agree to go to any place but not Libya.""

More than half a million migrants crossed the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy in 2014-2017, before heavy Italian pressure resulted in the disruption of smuggling networks on the North African country's coast and the withdrawal of charity rescue ships.

Libya's EU-backed coastguard has also stepped up interceptions, returning migrants to detention centers notorious for poor conditions and drawing sharp criticism from human rights groups.

Fourteen of the migrants docked at Misrata, including a Sudanese mother and her baby, agreed to come off the ship late on Wednesday, aid workers and a coast guard officer said.

Libyan authorities were still negotiating with the other migrants, who have so far refused to disembark.

""I was stopped by this ship and I thought I would be sent to Malta or Italy,"" Mohamed, a 19-year-old from Sudan's war-torn Darfur region, told Reuters by phone before the disembarkation started.

""I prefer to die but not to be returned to Libya ... it's a prison.""

The migrants are of Eritrean, Somali, Bangladeshi and Sudanese nationality and include a number of children.

Some required urgent medical assistance, and the Libyan coast guard has allowed international aid agencies to provide treatment and food supplies on board, said Julien Raickman, Libya mission head for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

He called for a peaceful resolution and said the most vulnerable migrants should be offered an alternative to detention.

""We talked to people who have suffered torture on the migration route and it seems abnormal that the United Nations cannot propose an alternative for them,"" Raickman said.

After migrants are returned to Libya they are screened by U.N. agencies and given basic assistance before being taken to government-affiliated detention centers, where they sometimes cannot be tracked and may re-enter smuggling networks.

Witnesses said the blast happened on Tunis's central Habib Bourguiba avenue. Hundreds of police cordoned off an area near the landmark Municipal Theatre and the French embassy, while ambulances evacuated the wounded.

""I was in front of the theater and heard a huge explosion,"" Mohamed Ekbal bin Rajib told Reuters.

Security has improved since authorities imposed a state of emergency in November 2015 after attacks on tourist targets that scared off holidaymakers and investors, worsening an economic crisis caused by a chronic deficit.

Shops were closed on the busy avenue that was the scene of protests that toppled long-serving leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali at the start of the 2011 ""Arab Spring"".

The bomber, aged 30, had no known militant background, the interior ministry said. Local media gave her name as Mouna.

""The woman left her city three days ago and told her family that she was going to the capital to look for work"", said Walid Hkima an official in interior ministry. She had a university degree in English and was from the coastal governorate of Mahdia, he said.

No tourists were injured, a security source said.

In 2015, 21 people were killed during a hostage siege in its national museum, the Bardo in Tunis, and a gunman killed 38 people on a resort beach. The following year, militants tried to capture the town of Ben Guerdane near the Libyan border.

There have been no attacks on that scale since then, but the economy has remained troubled and the authorities are concerned over the presence of militants in neighboring Libya.

11402111,2018-10-26,"ATHENS (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake shook western Greece early on Friday, damaging a port and a 15th century monastery, but causing no major injuries, officials and local media said.

The quake sent out tremors felt as far afield as Libya, Italy, Malta and Albania. Greek authorities initially issued a tsunami warning then withdrew the alert.

The magnitude 6.4 quake struck in the Ionian Sea, 50 km (31 miles) south of the island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante, Greece's Geodynamic Institute reported. The U.S. Geological Survey rated the magnitude at 6.8.

Three people were taken to hospital on the island, two of them slightly injured, a spokesman for Greece's civil protection agency said. A series of aftershocks, the highest at 5.6, rattled the island and power was briefly disrupted.

Tremors damaged a 15th-century monastery on the nearby islands of Strofades, local media in Zakynthos reported. They also left large cracks in the port of Zakynthos, though authorities there said operations would continue as usual.

""We are not facing any particular problems,"" Zakynthos Mayor Pavlos Kolokotsas told Greek state broadcaster ERT. ""Calm is being restored.""

Extensive damage was avoided because quake-prone Zakynthos had adopted seismic protection codes in construction, said Efthymios Lekkas, head of Greece's Earthquake Planning and Protection Organisation said .

""The energy unleashed, based on the angle of the faultline, fanned out towards Italy,"" he added.

Italy's Il Messaggero online news site said the quake was felt hundreds of kilometers away in southern Italy. Firefighters in Calabria, Puglia and Sicily received thousands of telephone calls from worried locals.

Zakynthos was all but destroyed in a 6.8 tremor in 1953. More than 140 people were killed in an earthquake north of Athens in 1999.

The quake was fairly shallow, according to the USGS, just 14 km (8.7 miles) below the seabed, which would have amplified shaking.

It struck at 1:54 a.m. (2254 GMT, Thursday). Greece straddles two tectonic plates and often suffers earthquakes.

Greece's Geodynamic Institute reported the magnitude as 6.4, and put the quake 50 km (31 miles) south of the island of Zakynthos. That compares with a figure of 6.8 assessed by both the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC).

The tremor was felt in Athens, the Greek capital, and as far away as Albania, Italy, Libya and Malta.

The epicenter was in the Ionian Sea, about 130 km (81 miles) southwest of Patras in the Peloponnese, the USGS said.

It was felt particularly on Zakynthos, also known as Zante, which was rattled by a series of strong aftershocks, the highest at 5.6, and where power was briefly disrupted.

Three people were taken to hospital, two of them slightly injured, a spokesman for Greece's civil protection agency told Reuters.

News websites said a 15th-century monastery had been damaged, with one, Zante News Time, displaying images of masonry that had fallen from a building facade and items dislodged from shelves in shops.

The power cut and slight damage to the port of Zakynthos, near the epicenter would not affect port operations, officials said.

11402113,2018-08-24,"TUNIS (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency said on Friday it was gravely concerned about a deterioration in conditions for migrants held in Libyan detention centers that had led to riots and hunger strikes.

Many migrants are taken to the centers after being intercepted by Libya's EU-backed coastguard as they try to reach Europe by sea, a policy that has been criticized by human rights groups.

An estimated 8,000 migrants are currently held in 18 detention centers linked to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, according to UNHCR.

Those detained make up a small fraction of the several hundred thousand migrants resident in Libya or passing through the North African country.

Humanitarian workers have limited access to the centers, which frequently open and close.

""In recent weeks, UNHCR has witnessed a critical worsening in conditions in detention centers, due to the increasing overcrowding and lack of basic living standards,"" the agency said in a statement.

""As a consequence, riots and hunger strikes by refugees inside detention centers are taking place, demanding a resolution to their bleak living conditions.

""This has led to a number of serious security incidents, where UNHCR front line staff have been placed at physical risk.""

Libyan officials have blamed poor conditions at detention centers on a lack of resources, and have said migrants are detained for their own protection.

Departures of mainly sub-Saharan African migrants from Libya to Italy peaked between 2014-2017 as the country slid further into turmoil following a NATO-backed uprising seven years ago.

Last summer smuggler networks were disrupted under heavy pressure from Italy, and Libya's coastguard stepped up interceptions.

So far this year 12,174 migrants have landed in Italy from Libya, nearly 87 percent fewer than during the same period in 2017, according to Italian interior ministry statistics.

11402114,2018-08-22,"ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday appealed to Italy's European Union partners to take in some of the migrants held on a coastguard ship in a Sicilian port and not allowed to disembark.

""What are they waiting for to intervene so that we can redistribute the migrants?"" Conte said on Facebook.

Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, from the far-right League party, has been resisting pressure to let the 177 migrants off the ship and the issue is straining relations with the League's coalition partner, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.

The coastguard ship Diciotti has been docked in the port of Catania for two days. Salvini has said he will not let the migrants aboard come ashore until other European countries agree to take them in. They were rescued from an overcrowded boat a week ago.

Backing up Salvini, Conte said Italy was ""waiting for a strong and clear answer from the European institutions and an adequate response from the other European countries"".

After Conte's comments, Salvini said on Facebook the 29 minors aboard the ship could disembark, but not the others. He accused other European countries of a ""cowardly silence"" over what to do with the migrants and said Brussels was ""sleeping"".

""If Europe doesn't play its part, as far as I'm concerned the boats can go back to where they came from,"" he said.

In response to criticism earlier on Wednesday, Salvini posted a picture of some 20 protesters holding banners, including one reading, ""Let's stay human"", at the Catania port.

""The 'very numerous' protesters who still want immigrants have arrived in Catania ... Should I send them a kiss?"" he wrote on Twitter, followed by an emoticon blowing a kiss.

Salvini also replied to a coastguard official who had told Corriere della Sera newspaper the situation was ""embarrassing"". Salvini said on Twitter that after over 650,000 arrivals from sea since 2014, ""I'm the embarrassing one?""

Salvini has repeatedly said Italy ""will no longer be Europe's refugee camp"", calling on European partners to share the burden. But his hardline position appeared to be irritating his 5-Star ally on Wednesday.

Roberto Fico, the 5-Star speaker of the lower house, said on Twitter the migrants ""must be able to disembark. They cannot be held on board any longer"".

Salvini snapped back: ""you do your job as speaker of the Chamber and I'll do my job as minister.""

Last month President Sergio Mattarella made a rare intervention in Italian politics to end a simmering dispute between the two governing parties over whether to let the Diciotti disembark 67 migrants in western Sicily.

With the help of the European Commission, Malta and Italy have taken in ships carrying migrants after European partners offered to accept a share of the new arrivals themselves.

""We call on everyone to contribute to a swift resolution so that the people onboard the (Diciotti) vessel may safely disembark,"" a European Commission spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

However, Conte said countries that had previously offered to take in migrants allowed to dock in Italy in July had not kept their word. France had taken some, but Germany, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Malta had not, he said.

For its part, the Maltese government said in a statement on Wednesday: ""The Italian authorities have not provided any tangible procedure for Malta to follow.""

It added that Italy had failed to meet its quota from a humanitarian vessel that docked in Malta in June ""despite the efforts of the Maltese authorities to complete this process with the Italian authorities"".

Migrant flows across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy - one of the main routes to Europe - have tapered off as Libyan factions have cracked down on people-smugglers, and as the EU has bolstered its support for the Libyan coastguard.

But people are still dying at sea and summer is peak season for migrants attempting the crossing, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

The ship, run by the Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), was allowed in after France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain agreed on Tuesday to take in the migrants, who were rescued off the coast of Libya.

Aid groups said there were more than 70 children on board.

The EU countries will also take some of a group of 114 migrants who were rescued by the Maltese armed forces and brought to Malta on Monday.

The row was the latest tussle illustrating how politically fraught the issue of coping with seaborne migrants remains despite a deal on migration that EU leaders agreed on at a summit in June.

Malta had initially argued that the migrants on board the Aquarius should be taken to Libya, Tunisia or the Italian island of Lampedusa, all closer to the rescue points.

As the ship docked, members of a right-wing group Moviment Patrijotti Maltin (Malta Patriotic Movement) unfurled a banner reading ""Stop Human Trafficking"". Next to them, crew members of another rescue vessel, the MV Lifeline, held up a banner of their own reading ""Everyone has a right to life.""

A government spokesman said the ship's migrants, mostly from Eritrea and Somalia, would be given an initial medical check before being taken to a reception center.

The charities gave a cautious welcome to the deal, saying EU states now needed to agree on a more permanent mechanism that would avoid seeing rescue ships stranded at sea for days.

""Maybe European states have finally understood that this concerns our common border at the south of Europe, that this is a problem for the 28 member states, and that we can't avoid responsibility and should work together,"" Frederic Penard, director of operations at SOS Mediterranee, told a news conference.

Spain will take 60 of the migrants, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez tweeted. Portugal said it would take 30 from the Aquarius and other boats that had arrived in Malta. France said it would take in 60.

""The decision was made in a context of humanitarian emergency and highlights the importance of having a lasting and sustainable mechanism to avoid the repetition of crises,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement.

The latest migrants had been rescued from boats off Libya, and Malta had initially argued they should be taken to Libya, Tunisia or the Italian island of Lampedusa, all closer to the rescue points.

It said it changed its mind following discussions with France and other European Union member states, that ended up with a deal on sharing responsibility for the rescued migrants.

Protracted feuds between EU states over how to handle immigrants have thrown the issue back onto the European agenda, despite the fact that overall Mediterranean arrivals have dropped sharply since peaking at around 1 million in 2015.

The latest row over the Aquarius illustrated how difficult that issue remained despite a deal on migration that EU leaders agreed on at a summit in June.

EU border agency Frontex said on Monday it had counted 73,500 ""irregular border crossings"" into the bloc so far this year via the sea and the Western Balkans route, more than 40 percent fewer than in the first seven months of 2017.

Spain took in 629 mainly sub-Saharan Africans from the same rescue boat in June, and Sanchez said this had helped pave the way to Tuesday's deal, which Malta called ""a concrete example of European leadership and solidarity"".",Reuters,energy,,"['Malta', 'France', 'Madrid', 'Valletta', 'Portugal', 'Libya', 'Spain', 'Luxembourg', 'Germany', 'Lampedusa', 'Tunisia', 'Italy']",Malta lets rescue ship dock after EU states agree to take migrants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants/malta-says-aquarius-rescue-ship-can-dock-migrants-to-be-shared-idUSKBN1KZ1JV,None,
11402119,2018-08-13,"ON BOARD THE AQUARIUS (Reuters) - Italy on Monday denied safe harbor to 141 people rescued by a humanitarian ship off the coast of Libya last week, setting up another standoff with European Union allies over taking in migrants who try to cross the Mediterranean.

The Aquarius, run by Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), picked up the people in two separate operations and is in international waters between Italy and Malta.

Malta said it had no legal obligation to berth the ship and Spain said its ports were not the safest destination.

Italy called on Britain to welcome the Aquarius because it was registered in Gibraltar, but the British territory on Spain's southern coast said it should go to an Italian port.

More than 650,000 migrants have come to Italy's shores since 2014, and Rome has accused its EU peers of not sharing the burden of taking in those who arrive on the bloc's southern border.

The Aquarius spent nine days at sea in June after Italy's new populist government took office and shut its ports to all humanitarian boats, calling its operators a ""taxi service"" and accusing them of helping people-smugglers -- charges the charities deny.

""It can go where it wants, not in Italy!"" far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Twitter on Monday, mentioning France, Germany, Britain or Malta as possible destinations.

""Stop human traffickers and their accomplices,"" he wrote.

Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, who oversees ports and the coast guard, tweeted that, because of the Gibraltar connection, Britain ""should assume its responsibility to safeguard the castaways"".

The Gibraltar government said in a statement the ship could no longer fly a Gibraltar flag from Aug. 20 and should revert back to the ""underlying owners' flag,"" which is Germany.

Meanwhile, the Aquarius should be allowed to disembark ""safely and promptly"" at an Italian port.

The European Commission was in touch with several EU states and trying to help resolve the situation, a spokesman in Brussels said. While Britain could theoretically be considered as a destination port, it was not practical to bring the ship there.

Malta rejected any suggestion the Aquarius should dock in its ports, saying the latest rescue was made closer to Libya, Tunisia and Italy than to its own shores.

""Malta was neither the coordinating nor the competent authority (and) ...the requests for the vessel to enter our ports are unwarranted and without legal standing,"" it said in a statement.

Earlier on Monday, Malta's armed forces rescued 114 migrants from a rubber dinghy taking on water 53 nautical miles (100 km) south of Malta and brought them back to the island.

In June, the Aquarius ended up taking some 630 migrants to Spain, which welcomed it. But on Monday, a government spokeswoman in Madrid said: ""Spain is not the safest port because it is not the nearest one"" for the ship to dock.

The ship's search and rescue coordinator Nick Romaniuk said some migrants on board were sick and wounded and ""need to be disembarked as soon as possible"" for proper medical care.

Due to pressure from Italy and Malta, most charity ships are no longer patrolling off the coast of Libya.

Though departures from Libya have fallen dramatically this year, people smugglers are still pushing some boats out to sea and an estimated 720 people died in June and July when charity ships were mainly absent, Amnesty International estimates.

Protracted feuds between EU states over how to handle immigrants have thrown the issue back onto the European agenda. That is despite overall Mediterranean arrivals having dropped sharply since peaking at around 1 million in 2015.

11402120,2018-08-05,"ON BOARD THE AQUARIUS (Reuters) - Rescue ship Aquarius, which has picked up almost 3,000 migrants from the Mediterranean this year, will carry out rescue missions without waiting for orders from coastguards and will not return people to Libya, its search and rescue head said.

""When we see there is a vessel in distress, with a high likelihood of people dying, we will go and rescue them immediately as per international maritime law,"" Nick Romaniuk told Reuters on board the Aquarius.

Over the last year coordination centers asking rescue vessels to go on standby or wait for clarification on certain things had added to the danger of people needing to be rescued, which is why they would no longer wait, he added.

The 77-metre vessel, operated by Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee, set sail from Marseille this week on its tenth mission of the year.

The ship will be patrolling between 25-30 miles from the Libyan coast, west of Tripoli, an area that is outside Libya's territorial waters but inside the Libyan search and rescue region.

International law states the country responsible for operations in an area has primary responsibility for disembarking rescue ships.

Romaniuk said that while Aquarius would continue to abide by international maritime law, it would not be taking people back to Libya because it was not a safe place, putting it at odds with the wishes of the new Italian government.

""Libya is still not recognized as a port of safety, so (we)will not be taking people back there, because... a rescue cannot terminate in a place which is not deemed a port of safety,"" he said.

""It has to continue for the time being to be European ports. But again, it's not our decision to make, maritime authorities, they make that decision, but our red line will be not taking people back to Libya,"" he said.

In the past the Aquarius has waited for orders from the responsible authorities before moving ahead to rescue migrants aiming to reach Italy from Libya.

But Italy has toughened its stance since the new government, a coalition including the anti-immigrant League party, took office earlier this year.

Interior minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, has spearheaded a policy to shut ports to charity ships that pick up migrants from overcrowded smugglers' boats. He now wants as many as possible to be picked up by Libyan coastguards and returned.

In June, the Aquarius picked up 629 migrants off the coast of Libya, planning to take them to the nearest European port - the usual practice with such rescue missions.

But the Italian government asked the ship to go to Malta rather than Italy, triggering a standoff that drew in the European Union and France.

Salvini has accused SOS Mediterranee and other charities of acting like a Mediterranean ""taxi service"" for the migrants.

The Aquarius is one of a number of NGO-supported ships that have carried out rescue operations in the southern Mediterranean, alongside the Italian navy and EU-led missions.

A rescue boat operated by the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms this week rescued 87 migrants in the southern Mediterranean in international waters.

11402121,2018-08-05,"(Reuters) - Almost 400 migrants were rescued in the Mediterranean this weekend as they attempted to make the crossing from Morocco to Spain, Spanish rescue services said.

While the overall numbers of migrants reaching Europe by sea is down from the peak in 2015, Spain has witnessed a steady increase in sea arrivals that began more than a year ago and has surged in recent months.

Through Saturday, 395 people were rescued from nine boats in the Strait of Gibraltar and the Alboran Sea, the two principal sea crossings to Spain, the Spanish coastguard said on Twitter. Two more people were rescued from a small boat on Sunday, it said.

Spain, which for the first time in years has overtaken Italy as the preferred destination for refugees, has registered almost 21,000 migrants so far this year, almost more than in the whole of last year, according to figures compiled by the International Organisation for Migration.

11402122,2018-07-27,"GENEVA (Reuters) - For the fifth straight year at least 1,500 migrants have perished in the Mediterranean, with the route between Libya and Italy being the deadliest, claiming the lives of one in 19, the U.N. migration agency said on Friday.

Spain, which has overtaken Italy as the preferred destination, has registered nearly 21,000 migrants so far this year, almost more than all of last year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

In all, about 55,000 migrants have reached European shores so far this year, against more than double that number at this time last year, 111,753, it said.

Italy - whose new government has closed its ports to rescue vessels - has had about 18,130 migrants arriving by sea from Libya this year, with the rest going to Greece, Malta and Cyprus.

""It's important to note two things: one is that despite incredibly low numbers arriving to Italy, the per capita death or the rate of death per 1,000 people may be at its highest point since the emergency began,"" IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a Geneva news briefing.

Referring to the 1,500 death toll, he said: ""It's only once in the previous four years (that) this mark has been reached later than this date in July and that was in 2014 when the emergency was really just starting"".

More than 600 African migrants forced their way through the heavily fortified border fence separating the Spanish North African enclave of Ceuta from Morocco on Thursday, using circular saws, shears and mallets to cut through the wire.

""What we can say is that the first indications that we are getting from the Spanish authorities is that it is the West African migrants that were most prominent crossing into Libya in the past couple of years who seem to be choosing Spain as their route now,"" Millman said.

11402123,2018-07-07,"TARIFA, Spain/RABAT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Spain has become the new main entry point for asylum-seekers fleeing Africa, an influx that European Union officials fear could exacerbate political tensions across the region over migration.

Around 19,000 asylum-seekers arrived in Spain in the first five months of this year, almost as many as arrived there in all of 2017, eclipsing for the first time the numbers flowing through north Africa to Italy.

The surge has intensified in recent weeks as Italy's new government shut its ports to most asylum-seekers, rescue officials say.

With the EU struggling to contain dissent over migration policy, some officials in Brussels say they worry that Spain could become a new flash-point, even as overall numbers of arrivals into Europe from Africa are in sharp decline.

""We must not let it blow up,"" an EU diplomat said.

He said the Morocco-Spain route had been kept under control for years. ""It's not dramatic for now, but we are keeping an eye on this one.""

Spain's new socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has been welcoming, and accepted two boat-loads of asylum-seekers denied port entry by Italy even as the number of boats from Morocco also rose.

The asylum-seekers are arriving in mostly inflatable boats each week, often without enough fuel for the crossing, straining Spain's coastguard. Madrid is training more lifeguards to deal with the rising numbers, coastguard union officials say.

People-smugglers in Morocco use a rights activist to contact the coastguard, advising it when boats set off for Spain, said coastguard official Oriol Estrada.

""The people traffickers know that the lifeguards are going to come for them,"" said Estrada, whose vessel has rescued around 1,200 people so far this year, more than 80 percent of its total for 2017.""They call to say that a certain boat has left such-and-such a coast at a certain time with however many people. They even give the names of those aboard.""

A similar situation developed off Libya before Rome's recent crackdown, prompting Italy's ruling League party to accuse rescue ships of running a ""taxi service"".

Rescue officials working in the Strait of Gibraltar say more Asian migrants from countries like Pakistan and Sri Lanka are also crossing, another sign that smuggling networks are focusing more of their efforts on Spain.

Morocco is a destination in itself for those fleeing poverty and violence in sub-Saharan Africa, but it has become more of a stepping stone as people determined to reach Europe realize the Libya-Italy route may be worse than futile, refugees say.

""In Libya I saw migrants being fired at with live ammunition. A friend of mine was killed in front of my eyes by a Libyan teenager,"" said Guinea migrant Oumar Dialo, who tried and failed to reach Europe via Libya before ending up in Morocco.

""I would never recommend Libya even to my enemy.""

Speaking in Rabat, Dialo said he had tried to reach Spain by crossing a fence on the border of Morocco and Spain's north African enclave of Ceuta, but fell and broke his leg. He said he would try to reach Spain again when the time was right, to pursue his dream of becoming a professional roller-skater.

""I want to go to Europe because I want to help my family and become a professional roller,"" he said.

Morocco said it was boosting efforts to counter illegal immigration this summer, the busiest time for sea crossings.

""Morocco is committed to cooperating with its partners in the fight against illegal migration,"" government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi said.

EU officials in Brussels are struggling to agree on a joint response to migration to calm tensions in Italy and Germany. Leaders signaled their concerns over Spain last week when they reached a new accord on the issue, pledging to support Madrid and Morocco to stem the tide.

A Spanish government spokesman told Reuters the arrivals trend started more than a year ago and was not a result of any one factor. He added Spain is pushing for policy in Europe to be harmonized, however.

There are early signs that Sanchez might feel political pressure to toughen his approach if the influx continues to pick up speed.

Fernando Maura, foreign policy spokesman for the center-right opposition Ciudadanos party, said the prime minister's current approach risked creating a ""pull factor"".

""When you send out a signal of this kind, it could well be received by those who want to come to Europe,"" he said.

11402124,2018-06-27,"BENGHAZI, Libya/LONDON (Reuters) - Libya's oil ports of Hariga and Zueitina appeared to be working normally on Tuesday, sources said, after eastern-based forces said they had handed control terminals in the east to a parallel National Oil Corporation (NOC) in Benghazi.

Libya, politically divided since the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, has two rival versions of the NOC, the internationally recognized NOC based in Tripoli in the west and the alternative NOC in the eastern city of Benghazi.

The ports are vital to controlling Libya's crude exports, the North African nation's main source of revenue, although shifting who controls the terminals creates uncertainty for international buyers of Libyan oil, deterring business.

The announcement for transferring operations of eastern ports to NOC in Benghazi follows military action by the eastern Libyan National Army (LNA) under the command of Khalifa Haftar to retake Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports, which are also in the east and remain closed.

Those two closures have disrupted oil flows amounting to about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), cutting by about half Libya's total output of about 1 million bpd earlier this year.

But sources contacted by Reuters on Tuesday indicated that Hariga and Zueitina port operations were continuing.

A shipping source said the Atlantic Explorer tanker left Hariga fully loaded on Tuesday morning, while an oil source said the vessel had been chartered by the NOC in Tripoli.

In Zueitina, an oil official said the situation was normal, with two tankers at the terminal, the first loading 600,000 barrels of oil and the second due to load 1 million barrels.

Haftar earlier signed an order handing ports ""liberated"" by eastern forces to the Benghazi NOC, which is aligned to an eastern government that rejects the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.

Alongside Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, a spokesman for the eastern LNA forces said the order included Zueitina and Hariga.

Combined exports from the five ports now under eastern control - Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina and Brega - were about 520,000 barrels per day on June 1-25, compared with 780,000 bpd for the month of May, according to oil analytics firm Vortexa.

Eastern-based factions have repeatedly tried and failed to export oil independently, unable to circumvent U.N. Security Council resolutions that recognize the Tripoli NOC as the sole legitimate producer and seller of Libya's oil.

The Tripoli government said the decision by the LNA would deepen divisions in Libya, which has been split between loose military and political factions in the two sides of the country since 2014.

""Such actions increase tension and anger and do not serve the path of consensus or lead in any way towards reconciliation, but establish disunity and engrain division,"" the GNA said.

In its statement, the GNA also appealed to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions committee to ""prevent all illegal sales operations that could happen due to these actions.""

However, a separate statement attributed to GNA Deputy Prime Minister Fathi al-Majbari and published on social media accounts expressed understanding for the LNA's decision ""due to systematic isolation and marginalization, and unfair distribution of the production resources.""

Majbari, who is from eastern Libya, was later abducted in Tripoli by one of the capital's powerful armed groups along with a member of parliament from his home town, according to a source from the GNA's leadership.

There was no official confirmation of the abduction but Tripoli's armed groups, some vehemently opposed to Haftar, have repeatedly targeted prominent figures including politicians.

The internationally recognized NOC in Tripoli has condemned the LNA's move as illegal, saying it would use ""all options available"" to legally pursue any companies that tried to buy oil from parallel institutions.

Analysts say Haftar's decision to shift control of the ports could be aimed at leveraging more public money from Tripoli, where oil revenues are processed by a central bank governor whom eastern factions have tried to dislodge.

Another GNA deputy prime minister, Ahmed Maiteeg, told reporters in Tripoli that the NOC should be protected from politics.

""This NOC does not deal with funds ... it manages the oil sector and operates production and it succeeded recently in raising production to an excellent level and standard,"" he said.",Reuters,energy,,"['Zuwetina', 'Benghazi', 'Tripoli', 'Libya', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Brega']","Libya's Hariga, Zueitina oil ports seen running normally despite power tussle",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-oil-idUSKBN1JM1KO,None,

11402127,2018-06-20,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel will try on Sunday to persuade other EU leaders to further curb immigration and restrict movement of asylum seekers within the European Union, to help keep her ruling coalition from crumbling at home.

All 28 European states are unlikely to fulfill at their June 28-29 meeting the demand of Merkel's coalition partner for a bloc-wide plan to spread the burden of hosting asylum seakers more widely across the EU.

Merkel hence pushed for an emergency meeting this Sunday with leaders from nine other countries - including the major arrival states Italy and Greece, as well as France, Austria, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and others.

Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which have refused to back plans to share out asylum seekers more evenly, will not attend Sunday's meeting. But Merkel is hoping a commitment by the states that do attend to do more to limit travel by asylum seekers within the bloc will help placate her coalition partners, the Christian Social Union (CSU).

""We see a strong need to significantly reduce secondary movements... by preventing unlawful crossing of internal borders between Member States by irregular migrants and asylum seekers and by ensuring swift readmissions by the competent Member State,"" said a draft of the statement for Sunday's meeting.

Asylum seekers already do not have the right to travel freely within the EU while their applications are being processed. But such ""secondary movements"" are difficult to stop in the border-free Schengen zone, and have been widespread since immigration to Europe peaked in 2015, when more than a million people arrived from the Middle East and Africa.

Immigration figures are now much lower, with only 41,000 sea arrivals so far this year, according to U.N. data. A sea route to Greece used by hundreds of thousands in 2015 was shut in 2016 by an agreement between the EU and Turkey, and the other main route across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy has also tapered as Libyan factions cracked down on people-smuggling.

But Merkel is still under new pressure to obtain more commitments from other states. Her coalition partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU) from the southern Gerrman state of Bavaria, has said it would bar from Germany all asylum-seekers registered in other EU states unless a summit of all EU leaders on June 28-29 agrees a bloc-wide deal to share them out evenly.

Merkel's stand-off with the CSU party leader, Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, has threatened the stability of her government. It has also brought back the issue of migration to the top of the EU's political agenda.

While an agreement on relocating refugees and migrants arriving in Italy and Greece to other EU states evenly is as far away as ever, the EU is now trying to shift attention to areas where all member states agree.

That means the summit is set to produce even more promises of tightening the bloc's external borders and cooperating closely with countries from Turkey and Jordan to Libya and Niger on preventing refugees and migrants from ever reaching Europe.

In addition to calling for more efforts to combat secondary movements, the summit draft statement proposes looking into ""regional disembarkation platforms"" outside of the EU where asylum requests could be assessed before claimants reach Europe.

Sources said Germany would want the Sunday meeting to produce a commitment from states like Greece and Italy to take back asylum-seekers who make it to Germany.

""Merkel needs to do this to help Seehofer climb down from a tree,"" one senior EU diplomat said.

But Italy, where a new government includes the anti-immigrant League, made clear it was not willing to play along.

""In the last four years, Italy has taken in 650,000 boat migrants and received 450,000 requests for asylum. So instead of taking, we are willing to give,"" said Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the League leader.

The results of the looming EU summit are likely to make getting to Europe and winning asylum even harder in the future, which rights groups have long decried as turning the continent into a ""fortress"" shut from less-privileged parts of the world.

On Wednesday, which marks the World Refugee Day, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said asylum applications to EU states nearly halved last year from 2016.

Europe's quickening migration diplomacy coincides with an international outcry over the U.S. administration's policy of separating migrant families at the Mexican border.

Pope Francis told Reuters in an interview that populists were ""creating psychosis"" on the issue of immigration, even as ageing societies like Europe faced ""a great demographic winter"" and needed more immigrants.

Without immigration, Europe ""will become empty"", he said.

Meanwhile, the summer peak season for migrants sailing in small boats from north Africa to Europe's southern shores is under way. The Italian Coast Guard ship Diciotti arrived at the Sicilian port of Pozzallo overnight with 519 migrants on board, relief workers said. They were saved in seven rescue operations off the Libyan coast, and some spent days at sea as a new Italian government looks to slow the influx.

11402128,2018-06-19,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A Libyan coastguard commander sanctioned by the United Nations for alleged human trafficking and migrant smuggling said he hits migrants but does so for their own safety to prevent them from capsizing.

Abdalrahman al-Milad, who heads a coastguard unit in Zawiya, just west of Tripoli, was one of six people sanctioned for involvement in people trafficking or smuggling in Libya on June 7, in the first move of its kind.

The sanctions freeze bank accounts of those listed and ban them from traveling internationally, and are an attempt to crack down on smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants on a risky voyage across the Mediterranean.

The U.N. Security Council said Milad's unit was ""consistently linked with violence against migrants and other human smugglers"" and cited claims by a U.N. panel of experts that he and other coastguard members were ""directly involved in the sinking of migrant boats using firearms"".

It also listed witness testimony from migrants who said they were brought on one of the ships used by Milad to a detention center where they were reportedly held in brutal conditions and beaten.

Speaking to Reuters in a phone interview, Milad denied any wrongdoing or involvement in smuggling and said he was prepared to hand himself over to international authorities if granted a fair trial.

""I reject these accusations,"" said Milad, also known as al-Bija. ""The Security Council has categorized me as a criminal without any evidence.""

""They accused me of striking migrants. Yes I strike migrants and this is so they sit correctly and don't move about. There is another migrant sitting next to him and the slightest movement can overturn the boat or make a hole and then they all drown.""

""Regarding me carrying out human smuggling, this is not true ... I am a legitimate officer in the navy and the only coastguard unit that has been working since 2014.""

""I have never fired a bullet at migrants."" Milad did not address the allegation that migrants were mistreated at a detention center.

Libya has two coastguards, one that is part of the navy and patrols at sea, and one that is under the interior ministry and operates along the coast. The navy has routinely denied accusations that its coastguard members abuse migrants.

Milad provided pictures of himself in camouflage uniform in the cabin of a boat and giving instructions to his men. He said he had been active in preventing illegal fishing and blocked fuel and scrap metal smuggling.

Migrant smugglers have been able to make vast profits by exploiting a security vacuum in Libya since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.

Milad said he received a monthly salary of 820 dinars, equivalent to $600 at the official rate, or just $120 at the black market rate. He said his 30-40 men sometimes made ""mistakes"", but he could not always be held responsible. He blamed his rivals for smuggling migrants.

The number of migrants crossing from Libya to Italy has dropped sharply from last July, when smuggling from the city of Sabratha, about 20 km (12 miles) west of Zawiya, was disrupted. But there are still frequent departures and deaths.

Libya's coastguard, which has received boats, equipment and training from Italy and the European Union, has become more active, intercepting more migrants and bringing them back to Libya. Milad said his unit had received a boat and some of his men had undergone training.

One of those sanctioned along with Milad was Mohammed Kachlaf, Milad's cousin and head of a guard unit at Zawiya's refinery. The Security Council said Kachlaf was suspected of providing cover for Milad's alleged migrant smuggling activity.

Kachlaf has also been accused of fuel smuggling by Libya's National Oil Corporation, which has called for the sanctions list to be expanded to include other alleged fuel smugglers across Libya.

11402129,2018-06-19,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan coastguards said on Monday they had recovered the bodies of five migrants and picked 191 survivors off the coast west of the capital Tripoli.

Libya's western coast is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by the sea, though the number of crossings has dropped sharply since last July.

The five dead migrants were brought back to port in Tripoli on Monday along with 115 survivors from various sub-Saharan African and Arab countries, coastguard officials said.

Their boat was intercepted off Mellitah on Sunday after being damaged by rough seas, according to Ayoub Qassem, a coastguard spokesman.

Another group of 76 migrants was intercepted on Sunday off Zawiya, just west of Tripoli.

Since last summer, smuggling networks inside Libya have been disrupted under Italian pressure and Libya's EU-backed coastguard has stepped up interceptions, returning more than 7,000 migrants to Libya so far this year.

Since January, some 10,760 migrants have crossed from Libya to Italy, more than 80 percent less than during the same period last year, according to statistics from Italy's interior ministry.

11402130,2018-06-18,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she wanted to support Italy in its efforts to reduce the number of migrants arriving on its shores, possibly handling asylum requests for Europe in non-European countries including Libya.

Most migrants attempting to reach Europe from Africa take the sea route from Libya to Italy, though last year saw a spike in numbers departing from Morocco to Spain instead.

""Italy is one of the countries that is receiving a lot of refugees as a first arrival country,"" Merkel told reporters before talks with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.

""We want to support Italy in its call for solidarity and hope that Germany will also be met with understanding when it comes to solidarity in Europe with the issues of migration.""

Merkel said her talks with Conte and other European leaders in coming weeks would focus on the question of how the European Union could enable a stable government in Libya and how its coast guard could be better trained.

""And how we can, if necessary, already carry out asylum-related proceedings there. These are all questions that we will discuss in the coming months and where we want to work very closely together,"" Merkel said.

Matteo Salvini, interior minister in the anti-establishment government that took office this month in Rome, has adopted a policy of blocking foreign humanitarian boats from Italian ports, which has triggered heated exchanges with France and the Netherlands.

Conte has spoken of the need for European-run immigration offices outside Europe to prevent ""voyages of death"". More than 3,000 migrants died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in 2017, according to the U.N. Migration Agency (IOM).

During the short news conference with Merkel in Berlin, Conte said the European Union had to change its position on migration. ""I think Germany is aware of this too,"" he added.

Italy wants to adapt current EU asylum guidelines in favor of ""a new approach that is more harmonious, so that whoever sets foot in Italy, sets foot in Europe"", Conte said.

11402131,2018-06-15,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Friday urged Italy's new prime minister to work with France, Germany and Spain on resolving migration issues rather than siding with an anti-immigration ""axis"" emerging within the European Union.

Smiling and calling each other ""my friend"", Macron and Italian premier Giuseppe Conte sought to bury the hatchet in Paris after a diplomatic squabble erupted this week over Rome's refusal to accept a migrant rescue ship at its ports.

There is concern in Paris over what stance Italy's anti-establishment government, led by lawyer Conte and with the head of the populist League party as deputy, will take on pan-European issues such as euro zone integration and asylum.

""I hope deeply that France and Italy will work hand-in-hand, together, to propose and contribute European solutions, in particular with partners like Spain and Germany,"" Macron said during a news conference with Conte alongside.

The row between Paris and Rome over the fate of the Aquarius, a ship with more than 600 migrants aboard, including women and children, drew in Pope Francis and sewed division across Europe, straining German Chancellor Angela Merkel's fragile coalition.

On Wednesday, Italy had summoned France's envoy and demanded an apology from Macron, who had said Rome's move to block the ship from its ports was an act of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"". After Italy demanded an apology, Macron said he had not meant to offend ""Italy and the Italian people"".

The two leaders on Friday avoided reporters' questions about their verbal jousting earlier in the week and tried to present a united front.

""There have been days that were a little tumultuous, but we are in perfect agreement,"" said Conte, who only two days ago had described France's stance on immigration as ""hypocritical"".

Conte said there was a need to create European-run immigration offices outside Europe in order to handle asylum requests in order to prevent ""voyages of death"".

More than 3,000 migrants died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in 2017, the fourth straight year that the death toll has topped this figure, according to the U.N. Migration Agency (IOM).

Most migrants attempting to reach Europe from Africa take the sea route from Libya to Italy, but last year saw a spike in the number of people departing from Morocco to Spain instead.

The origin of the dispute between France and Italy lies in Europe's inability to share responsibility for handling the influx of migrants fleeing war and poverty, largely in Africa and the Middle East, since the outset of the migration crisis in 2014.

Immigration has increasingly defined politics across the European Union, from France and Germany to Hungary, Italy and Austria. An EU poll showed that the issue is the top concern of European voters. A senior German diplomat said last year that it was a greater threat to EU stability than the euro zone crisis.

Earlier this week, Germany's interior minister, who hails from the conservative CSU party in Bavaria, said his country should form an ""axis"" on migration with Austria's right-wing government and Italy at interior ministers' level.

Macron said talk of such an axis was a reminder of Europe's darkest times -- Germany and its allies were referred to as the Axis powers during World War Two -- and said that only a country's leader could speak for the people.

""Italy has a head of government, France has a head of state, Germany has a head of government. If countries are to agree on something, it should be at that level, because only they answer to their people,"" Macron said.

Conte appeared to dismiss joining forces with a small group of member states that would go it alone with a tougher line on immigration.

He said he ""agreed with the words of my friend Macron"" regarding the need for an EU-wide approach to reforming the rules on immigration.

11402132,2018-06-12,"ABUJA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ten Nigerian children have been rescued from human traffickers planning to fly them to Russia and exploit relaxed visa controls for the World Cup, anti-trafficking officials said on Tuesday.

Five suspects, including a policeman and a quarantine officer, were arrested at Lagos' main airport for allegedly recruiting the victims - nine girls and a boy - and facilitating their travel, said Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency, NAPTIP.

The children - who were all in possession of a FIFA fan pass - were intercepted by officials as they tried to board a flight to Moscow on Saturday night, according to the agency.

Five other potential victims, also children, were stopped from boarding when staff noticed they only had one-way tickets.

Officials in Nigeria said last month they had intelligence showing plans were underway to traffic local women to Russia for the World Cup, taking advantage of Moscow's decision to let spectators enter the country with just a ticket and a fan pass.

""The agency will not give traffickers any opportunity to use the World Cup to ferry Nigerians out into a life of misery abroad,"" NAPTIP's director Julie Okah-Donli said in a statement.

Visa-free entry to Russia was trialled at the Confederations Cup in Moscow last year, and will apply to the entire World Cup, which runs across 11 Russian cities from June 14 to July 15.

Julia Siluyanova of Russian anti-slavery group Alternativa last month told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the eased visa rules were a ""present for traffickers"", as its normally strict system had typically made trafficking time-consuming and costly.

Many women and girls have been lured from Nigeria in recent years with promises of work and good wages only to end up sold for sex and trapped in debt bondage, and the World Cup could see the number of victims arriving in Russia soar, Siluyanova added.

NAPTIP is also trying to crack down on the trafficking of thousands of Nigerian women and girls to Europe each, who take boats from Libya to Italy, before being trapped in sex work.

The number of female Nigerians arriving in Italy by boat surged to more than 11,000 in 2016 from 1,500 in 2014, with at least four in five forced into prostitution, according to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).",Reuters,energy,,"['Russia', 'Nigeria', 'Moscow', 'Abuja', 'Lagos', 'Libya', 'Italy']",Nigeria thwarts World Cup child trafficking plot at airport,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-russia-worldcup-trafficking-idUSKBN1J81B7,None,
11402133,2018-06-06,"ROME (Reuters) - A plan to build the final stage of a $40 billion international gas pipeline in Italy is under review, the country's new environment minister said, calling the project ""pointless"".

Italy is at the end of the Southern Gas Corridor, a pipeline taking gas from central Asia to western Europe. It is a cornerstone of the European Union's energy security policy which aims to wean the bloc off Russian gas supplies.

Environment Minister Sergio Costa, sworn in on Friday as part of a ruling coalition of anti-establishment parties, said Italy's involvement in the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), the final stage of the 3,500-km (2,200-mile) corridor, would be reviewed along with some other major projects.

""TAP is on the table and we are looking at it as a priority ...,"" said Costa, who was nominated as minister by the coalition's biggest party, the pro-environment 5-Star Movement.

""Given (our) energy policy, given falling gas demand, that project today looks pointless,"" he added in written responses to a series of questions put to him on Tuesday and Wednesday.

A review would likely create tensions between Italy and the developers of the 4.5 billion euro ($5.3 billion) TAP project, which include British oil group BP, Italy's Snam and Spain's Enagás.

The TAP consortium did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.

It is unclear whether the minister's comments will translate into action. Costa said any decision on TAP's future would also involve other ministers.

The 5-Star also has more radical environmental policies than its coalition partner, the right-wing League.

The parties have said they will form a special committee to resolve any differences between them on the ""realization and completion of public works of national significance"".

The League did not immediately respond to emailed requests for a comment.

In recent years demand for gas in Italy has risen but it is still well below its peaks of a decade ago.

Italy, which imports more than 90 percent of its needs, has key gas contracts with Russia, Libya, Algeria and Holland and previous governments have sought to create a European gas hub.

Costa made clear the review would focus on the underlying rationale for the TAP project arriving in Italy. That is in contrast to recent public debate which has focused instead on its planned route through the country's southern Puglia region.

Even Puglia's governor has said it should be redirected away from a tourist area rather than scrapped. He has proposed an alternative route via a more industrial area of Puglia.

The new government's minister for southern Italy, Barbara Lezzi, another member of 5-Star, also told Reuters on Wednesday that her party believed the pipeline represented an unnecessary environmental danger given Italy's excess gas capacity.

The TAP consortium has said re-routing the pipeline away from Italy is not an option and that redirecting it inside Italy could delay the project by four to five years.

In recent years, red tape and grass root opposition have chased off several foreign investors seeking to build infrastructure in Italy.

Last month, Gas Natural said it had given up on a long-standing project to build a liquefied natural gas facility in northern Italy after years of slow progress.

The Southern Gas Corridor, already mostly completed, snakes its way from Azerbaijan through eastern Europe toward Italy.

It would bring up to 10 billion cubic meters of gas to Italy from Shah Deniz 2, a gas field developed by a BP-led consortium.

The Italian end is due to be completed by early 2020 and has already received national government approvals, including environmental clearance in 2014.

Costa said the review was consistent with the coalition's energy policy, which was outlined in a published coalition accord signed by 5-Star and League ahead of taking power.

A published copy of the accord does not specifically mention the TAP project but it says the coalition would accelerate Italy's transition to renewable energy.

11402134,2018-06-06,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed on Wednedsay fired Interior Minister Lotfi Brahem, a government statement said, after one of the worst migrant boat accidents in recent years.

The boat packed with some 180 migrants sank on Sunday off Tunisia's coast. The death toll has risen to at least 68, with dozens still missing.

The statement gave no reason for the sacking, but a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ""Chahed fired the interior minister for failing to stop the boat and illegal boat migration in general.""

Earlier on Wednesday Chaded also fired 10 security officials for failing to stop the boat.

Brahem will be replaced by Justice Minister Gazi Jribi, it said.

Most of the people on board the boat that sank on Sunday were Tunisians trying to escape unemployment and an economic crisis that has gripped the North African country since the toppling of autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.

Hundreds of people protested in the southern towns of Madenine, Tataouine and El Hamma on Tuesday evening against the poor economic conditions, residents said.

Human traffickers have increasingly moved their operations to Tunisia since a crackdown by the coastguard in neighbouring Libya.

Tunisia stopped about 6,000 migrants leaving its coast for Europe in the first five months of the year - a sharp increase from the few hundred prevented in the same period last year, an interior ministry official said.

This year up to May 2, a total of 1,910 Tunisian migrants reached Italy, including 39 women and 307 minors - 293 of whom were unaccompanied - compared to only 231 for the same period in 2017, according to the U.N. migrant agency IOM.

Overall, the number of migrants reaching Italy has fallen sharply since last July, when a major smuggling group in the Libyan coastal city of Sabratha struck a deal to halt departures under Italian pressure and was then forced out in clashes.

""This is a real present for traffickers,"" said Julia Siluyanova of Russian anti-slavery group Alternativa.

She said Russia's strict visa process had typically made trafficking people into the nation time-consuming and costly and the eased visa rules had now left the system open to abuse.

Visa-free entry was trailed at the Confederations Cup and will apply to the entire World Cup, which runs in 11 Russian cities from June 14 to July 15, and the ten days either side.

Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency NAPTIP said it had received intelligence that human traffickers were planning to take advantage of the tournament, and that it was working with the Russian embassy in the capital of Abuja to tackle the issue.

""If we alert Nigerians, we disrupt them (traffickers) ... and let them know that these plans are in the works,"" said Arinze Orakwu, head of public enlightenment at NAPTIP.

NAPTIP was unable to say how many women were trafficked into Russia, but an official in Nigeria's Edo state said it was sizeable.

""Women are being trafficked to Russia, and we get returnees back from Russia,"" said Yinka Omorogbe, head of Edo's anti-trafficking task force. ""It is not a frequent destination in the same way as Italy is, but we do get a pretty large number.""

Thousands of Nigerian women and girls are lured to Europe each year, making the treacherous sea crossing from Libya to Italy, and trafficked into sex work, the United Nations says.

The number of female Nigerians arriving in Italy by boat surged to more than 11,000 in 2016 from 1,500 in 2014, with at least four in five of them forced into prostitution, according to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

11402136,2018-05-28,"CATANIA, Italy (Reuters) - A baby boy named Miracle has been born on board a humanitarian ship - a bright spot as the tide of migrants risking sea crossings from Libya to Italy has increased as the weather has improved.

There have been more than 1,800 migrants rescued by humanitarian ships, and Italy's navy and coastguard vessels over the past three days, and one body was recovered, an Italian coastguard official said.

Arrivals from Libya, a staging post for people smugglers, have plummeted 85 percent this year from last as Italy provided support to the Libyan coastguard and to municipalities along the coast to stop migrant boats.

But good weather or other factors seem to have reversed that trend, for now.

""It's really hard to know what's happening inside Libya, or why the Libyan coastguard has not been so active in these last few days,"" said Lauren King, a spokeswoman from the Aquarius, the ship baby Miracle was born aboard.

The Aquarius is a rescue ship run by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), which brought ashore 70 migrants in Catania, Sicily, on Sunday. The Aquarius is setting off again later in the day for the waters off the coast of Libya.

""Given the weather conditions ... It's better we're out there and ready,"" she said.

On Saturday, the leader of the far-right League party, which appears poised to form a coalition government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, said that the surge in arrivals meant someone was trying to undermine the would-be administration.

""The usual powers that be are threatening us with the migrant boats,"" Matteo Salvini Tweeted.

The League has promised to take a hard line on irregular immigration and deport hundreds of thousands of migrants if the government receives the president's endorsement and wins parliament's backing.

Migrants rescued by the Aquarius spoke of horrific conditions and violence in Libya, including the mother of the baby born on Saturday.

""Both the mother and baby are doing very well,"" Amoin Soulemane, the midwife on the Aquarius, said in a statement. Miracle, weighing 2.8 kg, was the sixth baby born on the rescue ship, but the first this year, King said.

When Miracle was brought onto deck by the midwife, the migrants on board celebrated his birth by singing and dancing -- a far cry from the conditions they said they had came from in Libya.

The mother, whose name was not given, told MSF she had been ""held captive, beaten, given very little food and extorted for money for release"" during the year she was in Libya.

Following plane and helicopter searches, Spanish boats rescued almost 300 migrants from nine boats on Saturday, authorities said. As of Sunday afternoon, a further 250 migrants were rescued from eight boats, three of which were in poor condition and later sank, they added.

The migrants were from various countries in North and sub-Saharan Africa.

The number of people crossing into Spain by sea from North Africa, either via the Strait of Gibraltar or the Sea of Alboran, has increased significantly in recent years while arrivals to Italy and Greece via Libya have dropped.

Around 19,000 people made the sea crossing in 2017, representing a 182 percent increase on the previous year.

Europe's border agency Frontex said in January that it expected a further increase in irregular immigration to Spain this year, with flows boosted by the use of fast boats.

11402138,2018-05-15,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thirsty Middle Eastern and North African countries could tap into their solar-energy potential to cope with fresh water scarcity, according to resource experts.

Water could be saved by switching to renewable solar energy from fossil fuel electricity generation that uses up water, said the World Resources Institute (WRI).

The findings show moving to clean energy has benefits aside from cutting planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, said Tianyi Luo, a senior WRI manager.

""A lot of times, the water savings, that kind of benefits from renewable projects are overlooked,"" Luo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan ranked among the top countries, measured by lack of freshwater and solar energy potential, that could benefit from such a switch, the WRI said.

""These countries have high-average resources for both solar and wind that could be put to very productive uses, and it could potentially assist them in their water-related challenges,"" said Jordan Macknick, energy and water analyst at the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Fresh and sea water is often used in the process of cooling fossil-fuel power plants, ubiquitous in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the World Bank.

Put another way, powering one 60-watt incandescent light bulb for 12 hours over one a year can consume 3,000 to 6,000 gallons of water, according to the U.S.-based Virginia Water Resources Research Center.

Solar panels, meanwhile, require little or no water to install and maintain.

Yemen, an impoverished nation in the grip of civil war, topped the WRI ranking in terms of water scarcity and how much potential electricity solar farms could produce.

Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, ranked third.

Despite its wealth of oil, the kingdom recently stepped up its involvement in expanding solar energy with an announcement in March of investments to create the world's biggest solar power project.

11402139,2018-05-09,"U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a proclamation declaring his intention to withdraw from the JCPOA Iran nuclear agreement after signing it in the Diplomatic Room at the White House in Washington, U.S. May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Many regard the invasion of Iraq as the worst foreign policy move in the history of the American republic. Now we arguably have a competitor. The decision to abandon the nuclear agreement with Iran isolates the United States, reneges on an American commitment, adds to the risk of a trade war with the United States' allies and a hot war with Iran, and diminishes the prospects of a durable and truly verifiable agreement to eliminate the North Korean nuclear and missile threat.

The worst consequences would be a nuclear-armed Iran or a war with Iran, or conceivably both. These outcomes may yet be averted. At this point the initiative has moved to the other six signatories of this agreement and particularly the European NATO allies. Britain, France and Germany have stated that they will continue to abide by the accord and will seek to persuade Iran to do the same. Iran has agreed to do so as long as the Europeans can ensure that Tehran continues to secure the full benefits promised by the agreement. Doing so will require the Europeans to rebuff American efforts to punish their companies from trading with Iran.

This situation is not unprecedented. In 1982, responding to the imposition of martial law in Poland, President Ronald Reagan sought to punish companies helping to build a gas pipeline between the USSR and Western Europe. The Europeans threatened to retaliate against American firms and Reagan eventually backed down. In 1996 this pattern was repeated. Congress passed a law penalizing European investors in Cuba. The Europeans filed a case in the World Trade Organization and threatened retaliation. President Bill Clinton backed down.

It took months of transatlantic confrontation before these two disputes were resolved. It's likely to be harder this time around. The volume of trade potentially affected is now much larger, the transatlantic relationship is already much worse than it ever was under Reagan or Clinton, and President Donald Trump has shown less regard for Western solidarity than any of his predecessors. This time the breach may not be healed.

Trump is right to point with concern to Iran's destabilizing regional behavior, but the attention he devotes to it seems out of proportion to the actual threat to American interests. Islamist groups affiliated with Islamic State and al Qaeda are presently conducting insurgent campaigns in Nigeria, Mali, Niger, Somalia, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and the Philippines. U.S. troops are engaged in 10 of these countries, all except Egypt. Of these 11 conflicts Iran is engaged in only three: Syria, Iraq and Yemen. It is backing the opposite side from the United States in only one, Yemen. Curbing irresponsible Iranian behavior is a valid objective, but it will do little to address the threat to the U.S. homeland and is hardly the key to a more tranquil Islamic world.

Saudi Arabia and Israel back Trump's decision. As support goes, that is about it. No European or Asian ally supports the U.S. withdrawal. No major power supports it. No member of the G-7 or the G-20 supports it. Absent such international backing it is hard to see how the U.S. administration can achieve any of the goals for its new policy Trump announced on Tuesday.",Reuters,energy,,"['United States', 'Iran', 'Washington (state)', 'Tehran', 'North Korea', 'France', 'Germany', 'Iraq', 'Yemen', 'Syria', 'Somalia', 'Philippines', 'Nigeria', 'Niger', 'Mali']",Commentary: The U.S. is out of the Iran deal.

11402140,2018-04-27,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Conditions for migrants already suffering severe abuse in Libya have deteriorated further since a European-backed push to stop boat departures led to a sharp drop in the number of crossings to Italy, community representatives say.

Migrants are being trapped for longer by armed groups that are trying to extort more money from them through torture, said two volunteers who work with migrant communities in the capital, Tripoli.

Departures from Libya accelerated rapidly in 2014 as armed conflict spread, with more than 600,000 crossing the central Mediterranean in the past four years.

But the number of mainly sub-Saharan African migrants reaching Italy has fallen sharply since last July, when a major smuggling group in the Libyan coastal city of Sabratha struck a deal to halt departures under Italian pressure and was then forced out in clashes.

Libya's EU-backed coastguard has also returned more migrants to Libya after intercepting them at sea.

So far this year, just over 6,400 migrants have crossed from Libya to Italy, a drop of more than 80 percent compared to the same period last year, according to Italian interior ministry data.

For those inside Libya the situation is ""unbearable"", said Osman, a Sudanese community representative in Tripoli.

""Before, it was possible that they took money and then left (the migrants. Now they take the money and then torture them with fire, with electricity.""

""The torture has increased. The sea route is shut ... if you can't travel there's more torture.""

After losing secure camps on the coast where they used to hold migrants before sending them to sea, smugglers are operating further inland, particularly in desert areas around Bani Walid, about 145km (90 miles) southeast of Tripoli, said Khadija, an Eritrean long-term resident of Tripoli who volunteers to help African migrants.

Like Osman, she asked only to be identified by her first name. Both were speaking at a community center in Tripoli run by the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR.

""They are gangs and (the migrants) are delivered from one gang to another. I take my share then you receive the migrant and take your share, and so on,"" Khadija said, adding that they are asking for more money than before.

The business is largely run by Libyan and east African smugglers, she said. Pictures or videos of torture are sent to families to pressure them into making money transfers from home countries.

Since the clashes in Sabratha last September many migrants who were held in government-run detention centers have been repatriated by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), or through bilateral flights.

UNHCR has also begun resettling small numbers of refugees and evacuating others through Niger, though the Niger evacuations have been suspended because of delays in resettlement to European countries.

But hundreds of thousands of other migrants reside openly in Libya or are held by smuggling networks or for forced labor, often in dire conditions.

Aid workers say the health of migrants passing through the Bani Walid area has deteriorated, including cases of malnutrition and active tuberculosis.

A safe house in Bani Walid that takes in migrants who are so weakened from illness or abuse that they are abandoned by smugglers, has received more than 3,000 migrants since it was set up 14 months ago.

On a recent Sunday, about a dozen sub-Saharan African migrants were sitting or squatting in a courtyard, some with serious injuries from their journeys or from smuggler abuse.

Youssef, a 24-year-old from Senegal staying at the shelter, said he had been held for three months in a hidden prison outside Bani Walid before his parents managed to raise $1,500 to get him released.

More than 80 migrants survived the incident off the city of Sabratha, about 70 km (44 miles) west of Tripoli, and coastguards brought them back to the nearby city of Zawiya, said naval coastguard spokesman Ayoub Qassem.

The migrants were from various sub-Saharan African countries, he said.

A second boat, carrying 200 migrants including 38 women and one child, was intercepted off Zliten, about 135 km (84 miles)east of Tripoli, Qassem said. As well as African migrants, the vessel was carrying Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Indians.

Saadi Gaddafi, who has been held in the capital Tripoli since his extradition from Niger in 2014, was found not guilty of ""murder, deception, threats, enslavement and defamation of the former player Bashir Rayani,"" a statement from the ministry said.

He was fined 500 Libyan dinars ($377) and given a suspended one-year prison sentence for drinking and possession of alcohol in the 2006 case, the statement said.

Saadi Gaddafi, who under his father had a career as a footballer in Libya and Italy and was also a special forces commander, still faces other charges in Tripoli relating to the 2011 NATO-backed revolt.

He fled to Niger during the uprising, in which his father was overthrown and killed.

11402144,2018-03-23,"PARIS (Reuters) - Nicolas Sarkozy will challenge a barring order that forbids him from meeting key accusers and allies or traveling to countries such as Libya pending a judicial investigation into allegations that Muammar Gaddafi bankrolled his 2007 election campaign.

Sarkozy's lawyer, speaking publicly for the first time since the former French leader was taken into policy custody this week and told he was officially suspected of passive corruption, said he would lodge a legal appeal against the barring order.

Sarkozy himself, who held office from 2007 to 2012, launched a counter-offensive on prime-time television overnight, vowing to ""vanquish"" his accusers, among them, in his words, ""The Gaddafi gang, a gang of assassins"".

The 63-year-old, target of other judicial inquiries into political financing but nothing that resonates like the Libyan one, said magistrates did not have a shred of hard evidence and that the accusations against him were a ""monstrosity"".

In an appearance on one of France's main evening news shows that was watched by 6.9 million people, or more than one in six of the electorate, Sarkozy said:

""You cannot imagine how seriously I take this: if it takes me one year, two year or ten years, I will vanquish this gang. My honor will triumph. I will not cede a single centimeter to this lot.""

His lawyer, Thierry Herzog, used the same colorful language when he went on radio on Friday to defend his client.

""I will prove (ex-) President Sarkozy innocent. I will give proof he is innocent and then we will know who the evildoers are, who the thugs are, who the assassins are, who the robbers are,"" he told RTL.

Herzog, who is also handling a separate case where Sarkozy stands accused of illicit spending overruns in his failed 2012 re-election bid, said he was going to appeal a judicial barring order imposed on Sarkozy when he was released from custody on Wednesday after two days of questioning.

That order prohibits him from traveling to Libya, Tunisia and South Africa, sources close to Sarkozy say.

It bars him from meeting accusers that include members of the late Libyan leader Gaddafi's family and Libyan secret services as well as a Franco-Lebanese arms dealer who says he delivered cash in a suitcase to Paris as well as an intermediary arrested in London earlier this year.

He is also barred from meeting key allies including Claude Gueant and Brice Hortefeux, two close aides who were ministers under Sarkozy and have also been questioned by the judiciary.

Sarkozy said on the TF1 TV channel on Thursday that the sum police came up with for suspect money circulated during the 2007 campaign was 38,000 euros, calling that ""a very far cry"" from the 50 million euros cited by his accusers.

11402145,2018-03-22,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Spanish police have rescued 39 Nigerian girls and women from a notorious sex trafficking ring who kept them in squalid cave-like houses and forced them into prostitution after threatening them with black magic, Europol announced on Thursday.

The operation, carried out with British and Nigerian law enforcement agencies, led to the arrests of 89 people including a well-known Nigerian DJ, according to a Europol statement.

It said the Nigerian crime ring was linked to the Eiye Confraternity - a network that Spanish police have previously compared to the mafioso in Chicago in the 1930s.

The victims, many under the age of 18, were believed to have undergone voodoo ""juju"" rituals in Nigeria to force them to comply with orders, Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) said.

After being trafficked to Spain via Libya and Italy, the women and girls were kept in cave houses in the southeastern city of Almeria, it said.

They were then forced into prostitution to pay off ""debts"" of 30,000 euros ($36,900) each that they were told they owed the organization for their journey to Europe.

Europol said the DJ had helped transfer the victims to Spain and ""organize sexual exploitation"" in several provinces.

It said bank accounts used by the network to launder more than 300,000 euros had been blocked.

""(This) was a highly organized crime gang, exploiting young woman for lengthy periods of time, keeping them in horrendous conditions where they knew there would be no escape,"" the NCA's deputy director Tom Dowdall said in a statement.

Europol said raids were carried out across 11 Spanish cities last November but the operation could not be announced until Thursday to avoid jeopardizing investigations.

The NCA said police had also arrested a Nigerian woman in Manchester this year who they believe was controlling some of the victims in Spain. She is in custody awaiting extradition to Spain, it said.

11402146,2018-03-06,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The failure of Italy's neighbors to help out more with a huge influx of migrants boosted the anti-immigrant vote and contributed to the resounding defeat of its ruling party in last weekend's election, European officials acknowledge.

But given the difficulty of persuading all EU states to take their share of new arrivals, officials in Brussels now believe the bloc will have to take a harsher line on immigration.

""The message we hear is: continue being very, very tough on asylum. Be tough as you can on immigration. And then get even tougher,"" said a senior European Union diplomat.

Italy's center-left Democratic Party won less than a fifth of the votes, losing to anti-establishment and right-wing parties that campaigned hard against immigration.

Under pressure from euroskeptic rivals, mainstream EU politicians read it as meaning they must take a hard line on immigration or risk losing power.

""Italy has, it's undeniable, suffered for months and months under the pressure of migration. This very strong migration pressure is a context we should keep in mind,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron.

About 170,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean to Italy in 2014, according to U.N. figures. In the next two years arrivals were 154,000 and 181,500, before falling to 119,000 in 2017.

Italy and Greece bore the brunt of the influx as the EU struggled to manage a crisis that delivers daily reminders of its urgency.

African immigrants marched through Florence on Monday chanting ""no more racism"" after an Italian man shot dead a Senegalese street vendor earlier in the day.

On Tuesday, officials said 21 migrants were missing and feared drowned when a rubber dinghy and a wooden boat had to be rescued after setting off from Libya for Italy.

The crisis that reached a head in 2015, when more than a million people arrived in Europe from the Middle East and Africa, has shaken the EU and fueled a wave of anti-immigration and euroskeptic sentiment.

The EU has since agreed deals - criticized by rights groups - with countries such as Turkey and Libya, offering them money and other help to keep people away from its shores.

The bloc has tightened its external borders and asylum laws and is spending more in distant countries to stop people from heading for Europe.

The Italian vote means the EU will stay on this course, officials in Brussels say, turning itself into what rights groups call ""Fortress Europe"".

In Austria, a government official said the vote was ""another wake-up call"" in support of the tougher migration policies advocated by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.

But behind the EU's unity on the need to stop refugees and migrants arriving in the first place lies a more intractable problem.

While frontline states on the Mediterranean bore the immediate impact of the jump in immigration, and wealthy countries such as Germany and Sweden also took in large numbers, post-communist governments in the east refused to accept their share.

Rome and Berlin blamed nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary for failing to show solidarity when it was needed, while they still accepted the development money western nations send to the bloc's poorer members.

""There is a problem with solidarity in Europe,"" Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said in Dublin on Monday. ""We are all part of the responsibility,"" he said, referring to the eastern Europeans.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar agreed that the whole EU must assist those most in need.

Italy and Greece feel they have been left to manage on their own, while Germany, the Netherlands and France have pressed hard, if in vain, to break the resistance in the east.

Some in the west have proposed cutting EU handouts for the east but the ex-communist states hit back.

Commenting on the Italian election, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said EU pressure over migration could backfire.

""Today, the root of euroskepticism is in the founding members of the EU, while central and eastern Europe is a center of stability,"" he said.

Poland and Hungary, as well as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, cite security concerns and the need to preserve the traditional make-up of their societies in refusing to accept refugees from the Middle East and North Africa.

The 21 people missing were all among the 51 on the wooden boat, and two dead infants had reportedly been discovered on board, bringing the likely death toll to 23, IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. All 132 people on the rubber dinghy were rescued, he said.

Both incidents happened on Saturday, but survivors had only just reached the port of Pozzallo in Italy, Millman said. Other survivors were shipped back to Libya.

In a statement, Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said it was sanctioning six people, 24 companies and seven vessels in a move that prohibits Americans from engaging with those targeted and freezes any related property under U.S. jurisdictions.

The sanctions target people from Libya, Malta and Egypt, according to the statement. Issued under the authority of a 2016 executive order by then U.S. President Barack Obama, companies based in Italy, Libya and Malta are also targets, the statement said.

The United Nations Security Council has condemned illicit exploitation of oil from Libya, which has been mired in conflict since an uprising in 2011 that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, who led the country for more than 40 years.

""Oil smuggling undermines Libya's sovereignty, fuels the black market and contributes to further instability in the region while robbing the population of resources that are rightly theirs,"" OFAC's statement said.

Libya's oil production has steadied but is still well below the 1.6 million barrels per day it was pumping before the insurgency seven years ago and is suffering from theft, abduction and other security threats.

Production from at least one Libyan oil field has also been disrupted by a dispute over security guards' pay.

Libya's Currency Crisis: Part of the Resource Problem

While it won't resolve the broader war for control of Libya's government (read: oil wealth), getting a handle on the country's liquidity crisis could starve militia groups who are making money off this (not counting for their funding from external actors). Militias have been making money off the gap between official and black market exchange rates.

Libyan officials say the liquidity crisis should be resolved by February of next year by converging the rates and restoring supply of Libyan dinars and dollars. The next step will be to start fuel subsidy reductions, on which Libya is currently spending some $5 billion annually.

Not only the exchange gap, but also these fuel subsidies have been feeding militia coffers, via smuggling revenues. For oil and gas investors willing to brave what is essentially a civil war that is nowhere close to being resolved, resolving this liquidity crisis and getting fuel subsidies under control would -- according to officials -- put $1.8 billion into budget coffers next year, enabling them to start (or re-launch) major energy development projects.

After months of continued optimism in the media and political statements coming out of Paris and Rome about a possible peace deal between the two competing governments, led by Libyan general Haftar and his counterpart El Serraj, the situation on the ground is looking even worse than before. The eagerly awaited oil production increase from Libya, which could supposedly mitigate the effects of falling production from Iran and Venezuela, now seems unlikely to happen. NOC officials stated that the production of the 315,000 bpd field, which is located in the south of Libya, has been blocked by protestors and militias in the area. A group of tribes, armed protestors and guards took over the field on December 8, asking for salary payments and additional financing. Until now, Libyan government officials have been unable to quell the protests. NOC officials have reiterated that the financial demands will not be met, as this could set a precedent for other oil and gas operations in the country.

It is still unclear who the real culprits behind the current blockade and seizure of the field are as sources are blaming different groups or militias. NOC claims that the field has been taken over by a militia that is reportedly trying to get on the payroll of the field guards. No indication at present can be given as to when the field will come back onstream. NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanallah has called for the force majeure in a move to provide security to the workers at the field.

In recent weeks, several other fields have also been occupied, blocked or taken over - but production has not been significantly impacted at those fields. Tribal representatives and several militias have indicated to the press that the current blockade is a protest against marginalization and shortages of electricity, fuel and money.

It is the UN-EU backed Libyan government GNA that is feeling the brunt of the pain from these protests. The militias and tribal groups are currently targeting GNA operations as the Tripoli-based government has been accused of marginalizing the southerners.

Libya's oil and gas fields and infrastructure, including the export ports, such as Zawya, have been the main targets in the ongoing civil war between the two competing governments after the removal of Libyan leader Muammar Ghadaffi. At the same time, several major extremist fundamentalist groups, such as Daesh/ISIS and AL Qaeda are also very active in parts of the country. For months, the power struggle between the GNA and the forces of General Haftar has been concentrated around Libya's main economic artery, its oil and gas fields. Haftar, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Russia, appears to be winning this struggle, slowly but steadily taking over more of the country.

Haftar has been able to tighten his hold also over the so-called Petroleum Facilities Guard, a para-military security force tasked with securing oil and gas operations. At the El Sharara field, the main occupying force at present seems to be the same Petroleum Facilities Guards.

In addition to the force majeure at the oilfield, security forces in Libya's Tobruk Port said to the press that the port was closed indefinitely for security concerns, a statement that was followed by gunmen storming the port on Sunday. In October 2017 the port was closed for a long period due to pressure from General Haftar's so-called Dignity Operation.

Overall, Libya's political and oil future is a shambles. Even after high-level meetings in Paris and Rome, where the French and Italian government tried to set up their own security and governmental arrangements between the fighting factions, the is no end in sight to the fighting on the ground. Currently, another round of violence is brewing in and around Tripoli, where several militias are looking to expand their control over parts of the city, weakening the power of the Western-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). Since a brokered ceasefire in September, most militias have been pulling back, but the tensions at present point to a willingness for a new round of conflict. The UN-GNA approach to either include the militias in security forces or demobilize them is under pressure. Still, some hope remains, as analysts indicate that militia leaders are willing to cooperate, largely in a move to protect their (illegal) income. Stability - in the end - will depend on the willingness of the GNA forces to put their foot down if needed

Even if the Tripoli situation can be resolved, the future depends largely on General Haftar. Haftar is looking for any opportunity to expand his powers to the western parts of Libya, having already secured most of the east. Haftar still openly pushes his pledge to ""liberate"" Tripoli by forging alliances in the west. Arab countries, such as the UAE and Egypt, are supporting Haftar to make a deal with western Libyan militias to stabilize the whole country. NATO-member Italy has also shown a preference for the Haftar option, especially after Moscow openly stated its support of the Libyan general.

Even French president Macron pushed the position of Haftar during the Paris meeting of the GNA and Haftar militias. In Paris Haftar and his counterpart Al Serraj agreed to a ceasefire and Spring elections, but the general declared hours later that he has no intention of sticking to that agreement. Past attempts to negotiate peace in Libya have been undone by splits within each faction, which are often made up of loose alliances of convenience among brigades of former rebels more loyal to cities, regions or tribes than to the idea of a Libyan nation. Haftar now seems to have the upper-hand, after partially defeating IS led militias and other extremists.

None of this bodes well for Libya's oil operations. Haftar's next moves towards Tripoli will almost certainly be a military operation to win all oil and gas fields that are currently under GNA influence. More actions and possible disruptions can be expected very soon.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Rome', 'Paris', 'Venezuela', 'Iran', 'Tobruk', 'Tripoli', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Italy', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Moscow']",Libyan Oil In Jeopardy As Peace Talks Fail | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libyan-Oil-In-Jeopardy-As-Peace-Talks-Fail.html,None,
11402509,2018-10-25,"Libya held on Wednesday an oil and gas forum in the eastern city of Benghazi, looking for dialogue with rival institutions in the east, including an oil company parallel to the internationally recognized National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in Tripoli.

The Benghazi Oil and Gas Exhibition and Forum is a rare event for the divided country in which rival institutions in the east and west have been vying for control over parts of the country and, on many occasions, over the oil fields and oil ports. The forum in Benghazi, Libya's second-biggest city, is the first international conference in the eastern city since 2014, when fighting erupted in the area, Reuters notes.

""Benghazi city will play a prominent and important role for the oil and gas sector in the region and probably the world,"" Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of Tripoli-based NOC, said in his opening remarks, as carried by Reuters. Sanalla's participation in the conference and the speech was a rare sighting in Benghazi for the chairman of the NOC.

A Schlumberger executive told Reuters that the conference would be an important event for the oilfield services group.

Although no deals are expected to be reached during the conference, oil industry sources told Reuters that it is a political message to appease the eastern part of Libya, which has much of the oil resources and several of the key oil ports.

Libya's NOC is holding talks with international oil companies that could result in increased investment and production in Libya's oil industry, if security across the country improves, Sanalla said last month.

Earlier this month, Sanalla told Bloomberg that Libya's oil production could rise by several hundred thousand barrels daily when BP and Eni resume production at a shared field. NOC's chairman said Libya's current oil production was more than 1 million bpd ""despite local security challenges,"" adding that BP and Eni planned to restart their exploratory drilling operations at a field near the Libyan border with Tunisia in the first quarter of next year. They could then fast-track production, Sanalla said.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Benghazi', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Tunisia']",Libya Seeks Reconciliation With Oil Conference In The East | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libya-Seeks-Reconciliation-With-Oil-Conference-In-The-East.html,None,
11402510,2018-08-20,"The recent turmoil in Libya's Oil Crescent - a region which stretches along the coast from Sirte to Ras Lanuf, and which extends down to the Jufra district - has underscored the competition for the control of state revenues, as Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) has intensified its attempts to seize key national institutions ahead of the December 2018 presidential elections. Seven years after the fall of the Gaddafi regime, Libya remains locked in a cycle of offensives and counter-offensives between militias loyal to rival political groups. Although oil production experienced a significant increase in 2017, continuing insecurity and the vulnerability of oil infrastructure to disruptions from armed groups and local protesters still largely constrain Libya's oil potential.

According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2018, Libya has the largest proven crude oil reserves in Africa, with 48.4bn barrels. The hydrocarbons sector constitutes the backbone of Libya's economy: oil exports typically provide more than 90% of government revenue and over 95% of export earnings. The battle for the control of oil resources is at the center of a conflict pitting the country's two rival administrations against each other, with armed groups fighting to strengthen their grip over the fragmented political landscape. Among all actors, the most important one is Marshal Haftar's LNA. Other key actors include:

The exacerbated competition for the control of oil revenues

Libya's oil production has been subjected to fluctuations due to the volatile relationship between rival authorities in Tobruk and Tripoli. The country's oil infrastructures have been separated, with different government factions and armed militias controlling the oil terminals. The National Oil Corporation (NOC) -- a Tripoli-based state-run entity that has legal control over most of Libya's oil resources -- has expressed neutrality in the conflict, but its ability to manage the flow of exports was dented after eastern authorities established a rival NOC in 2014, which has begun to operate from the city of Benghazi. Although it never gained international recognition, the eastern NOC has made attempts to sign exploitation contracts with foreign firms. In August 2015, it sent invitations to several oil majors to attend a conference in Dubai, with the aim of ""discussing legally signed agreements and contracts."" However, at the time of writing there have been no documented examples of oil sales from NOC east into the international oil market.

In April 2016, the dispute between the rival NOCs led to a three-week blockade of the Marsa el-Hariga port, a standoff which costed Libya $10 million a day. After particularly acute tensions following the el-Hariga blockade, the rival eastern and western branches of the NOC were unified in July 2016, in an attempt to avert a financial crisis, as Libya's foreign reserves were growing dangerously depleted. According to the World Bank, between 2013 and 2016, Libya's foreign exchange reserves fell from $109 billion to around $70 billion, considerably constraining the GNA's financial position, and threatening the government's ability to pay state-sector salaries.

The capture of oil fields by militias

Although an important development, the NOC reunification itself was not sufficient to ensure the revival of oil production. In early March 2012, leaders from the eastern region of Cyrenaica (or Barqa in Arabic) elected a regional governing council and issued a declaration of semi-autonomy from the government in Tripoli. The separatist push posed an immediate threat to the functioning of the oil industry, as Cyrenaica holds 60 percent of Libya's crude reserves and boasts both the major sea port of Sirte and Benghazi, the country's second largest city. The movement was led by Ibrahim al-Jathran, a former rebel fighter who commanded the ""Hamza"" brigade during the uprising against Gaddafi, which fought along the coast from Ajdabiyah to the Gaddafi's homeland Sirte area.

Often referred to as a federalist, al-Jathran can be better described a political pragmatist, who has alternately allied himself with both the HoR and the western authorities in Tripoli. Determined in his struggle for Cyrenaica's autonomy, al-Jathran used the region's large oil manna as a means of exerting political pressure on Tripoli. He took the helm of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG), once one of the most prominent militias in the east, which in its heyday comprised over 20,000 fighters. In mid-2013, PFG forces seized the oil fields of Es-Sider and Ras Lanuf, the largest and second largest terminals in the country, blocking sales worth at least $5 billion. In the aftermaths of the seizure, al-Jathran threatened to declare independence if the government refused to give eastern Libya more autonomy over oil revenues. He even authorized the sailing of a tanker loaded with $16 million of crude oil from the eastern port of Sidra under the North Korean flag, although the ship was promptly taken over by the American navy Seals.

With the PFG operating key oilfields in the east, oil production fluctuated significantly between 2013 and 2016, with a peak at 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in March 2015, which is way below pre-conflict levels of 1.6 million bpd. Despite the signing of the LPA in December 2015, authorities in Tripoli did not manage to retake control of the oil facilities. This offered a strategic opportunity to Haftar's LNA, which had started to conduct an anti-Islamist campaign in the area around Benghazi, with the support of Persian Gulf monarchies keen to see the political influence of Islamists diminished throughout the region. In September 2016, LNA troops launched an assault against the PFG factions in the Oil Crescent, gaining effective control over the Es-Sider, Ras Lanuf and Zueitina fields. During the same offensive, Haftar's forces also gained control of the 60,000 bpd Marsa el-Brega port. Following the clashes, a unit of the PFG lifted a two-year blockade on the pipelines connecting the 330,000 bpd Sahara field to Libya's Zawiya refinery, and the El-Feel field to the Mellitah complex. In January 2017, the NOC announced the lifting of a ""self-imposed moratorium"" on foreign investment in the oil sector which had been in place since 2011. Production quickly rose to 1 million bpd in July 2017, reflecting the LNA's success at gaining control over oil facilities from the PFG.

The resumption of operations at Libya's largest fields attracted international attention, with oil majors making prudent return to the country. In February 2017, Russia's Rosneft signed supply and cooperation agreements with the NOC, although no details on the offtake deal were provided. A few months later, US oilfield services company Schlumberger said it would resume joint operations with Libyan Sirte Company. Even French energy company Total expanded its operations in Libya, with the purchase of a 16.33 percent stake in Libya's Waha concessions from U.S. Marathon Oil. However, security threats from various armed groups and local militias remain, deterring most international firms from re-entering Libya's oil sector.

Renewed insecurity in the Oil Crescent

The brief lull in the Oil Crescent did not last long: on June 14 this year, militants of the BDB seized the Ras Lanuf and Es-Sider export terminals. BDB forces -- included mercenaries recruited from southern Libya, Chad and Sudan -- carried out the attack under the command of al-Jathran. The two terminals were recaptured by forces from Haftar's LNA on June 21, with suspected air support from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to Mustafa Sanalla, the head of the NOC, the clashes led to a production loss of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd). Three oil storage tanks were set on fire, causing damage the NOC has said will take years to repair.

The BDB's latest offensive reflects a strategic military error from Marshal Haftar, who left the Oil Crescent lightly defended and focused more on other conquests in the east. Although the fields were quickly retook by the LNA, Haftar refused to hand back the control of the terminals to the Tripoli-based NOC. On June 25 -- in what was perceived as a political gamble from the Marshal -- LNA's spokesman Ahmed Al-Mismari announced that the self-styled army would hand over control of the ports to the rival NOC in Benghazi, which remains active despite the 2016 reunification. Al-Mismari argued that the decision was aimed at preventing ""terrorists"" from receiving salaries generated by oil revenues via the Central Bank of Libya (CBL), which pays salaries to a wide range of Libyan militias, as thousands of militiamen have been added to the state payroll since the collapse of the Jamahiriya regime. The move was quickly denounced as illegal by the western NOC and the international community. On June 25, chairman of the western NOC Mustafa Sanala declared force majeure on Ras Lanuf and Es-Sider port terminals, a decision extended to el-Hariga and Zueitina on July 2. The U.S. Embassy in Libya also issued a joint statement signed by the governments of France, Italy and the United Kingdom, reasserting that Libyan resources ""must remain under the exclusive control of the legitimate National Oil Corporation."" Most specifically, the statement outlined that if the eastern NOC attempts to market the oil, it would violate UN Security Council Resolutions 2259, 2278 and 2362, which affirm that oil resources must be operated and sold under the sole authority of the GNA.

Haftar's gamble

Haftar's move is above all a political gamble, as the Marshal now holds all of the most valuable cards since the takeover of Derna, and figures to play a central role in any unified national administration following next December's presidential and parliamentary elections. In challenging the Tripoli-based administration over the control of oil income, Haftar aimed at bolstering his legitimacy towards the Oil Crescent's population. The region is home to numerous tribes with significant political influence, including the Magharba tribe, whose leaders have expressed discontent with the LNA for failing to improve their standard of living and security, and did not join Haftar's effort to push back the BDB's factions. The Marshal seems to have successfully positioned himself as the champion in the fight against widespread corruption, with his move receiving statements of support from local political bodies in the Sirte basin, in areas such as Jalou, Awjala and Ejkherra.

Besides this charm offensive with local tribes, another of Haftar's goals is to ensure stable funding for the LNA, which currently relies on Gulf Monarchies to finance its military and political campaigns. Indeed, in a statement issued by the LNA's general command on July 4, Haftar set five prerequisites for the reopening of the oil ports, the first one being the replacement of the current CBL governor, Sadiq al-Kabir. Haftar has long wanted to appoint a new head for the CBL, accusing al-Kabir of favoring western Libya and the Tripoli-based administration. Highlighting the controversy over al-Kabir, in December 2017 the HoR elected Mohamed al-Shokry as governor of the CBL, in an attempt to unseat al-Kabir. However, Shokry's appointment was not accepted by the international community and the GNA, and was never followed through. An Haftar-affiliated figure at the head of the CBL would most surely favor the LNA Authority for Investment and Public Works, which is modeled on the Egyptian army's involvement and ownership in the Egyptian economy.

Haftar eventually handed over the ports to the Tripoli-based NOC, which resumed production and export operations on July 11, 2018. However, this episode has fueled the long-standing tensions over the Oil Crescent, with western militias bitterly opposed to any form of cooperation with Haftar. This was highlighted by their expressed rejection of the May Paris conference, which brought together Haftar, GNA Prime Minister al-Sarraj, and HoR head Aguila Saleh. Among those militias, the powerful Qatar-backed Misrata Military Council (MMC) is Haftar's fiercest opponent, and will use all means at its disposal to stop the Marshal's rise to power. In this context, there is a possibility that MMC's factions might embark on large offensive over the Oil Crescent, with the ultimate goal of bringing the region under the Tripoli-based NOC's exclusive control. Renewed clashes at Libya's main oilfields would have a catastrophic impact on the country's economy, as oil revenues accounted for more than 93 percent of the GNA's total income in the first six months of 2018.

Russia and Saudi Arabia are rushing to calm oil markets following a new set of outages in Libya.

- The EIA predicts that gasoline prices in the U.S. have already peaked and will gradually decline over the course of 2018. The high point was in late May when the national average hit $2.96 per gallon. The EIA notes that gasoline prices tend to peak in the summer when demand is at its strongest point and more expensive summer fuel blends are required.

- The EIA predicts gasoline prices to fall to $2.84/gallon by September and to $2.68/gallon by December.

- However, the short-term outlook seems to ignore the growing number of crude oil supply outages around the world, which is driving up oil prices.

- There is always a several month lag between changes in oil prices and changes in prices at the pump. But WTI is back to a three-year high, which likely means that gasoline prices are set to rise in the coming weeks, defying the EIA forecast.

Tuesday July 3, 2018

Oil prices surged in early trading on Tuesday as the supply outages in Libya began to take center stage, but Saudi Arabia and Russia quickly moved to calm markets. The loss of 850,000 bpd nearly offsets all of what OPEC+ plans on adding to the market, although it remains to be seen how high Saudi Arabia plans on going unilaterally. For now, the oil market is looking tighter by the day, and Brent is within striking distance of $80 per barrel.

OPEC production rises in June. Saudi Arabia ramped up production in June ahead of the OPEC+ meeting, pushing the group's overall output to 32.32 million barrels per day (mb/d), according to Reuters, an increase of 320,000 bpd from May. That puts OPEC's production level at its highest point since January 2018. The increase came from a massive increase in production from Saudi Arabia, which pushed output close to a record high at 10.70 mb/d. The enormous increase of from May levels from Saudi Arabia was offset by outages in Libya and declines in Venezuela. ""We are entering the second half of the year with a huge amount of uncertainty surrounding the supply side of the equation,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM, told Reuters. ""Depending on your belief you could just as easily bet on $100 as $60 by the end of the year.""

Oil dips on Monday on Trump tweet, rises on Tuesday. Over the weekend President Trump tweeted that OPEC would add 2 mb/d of new supply, a statement that confused the oil market. The White House had to walk back that comment, issuing a statement that said that the Saudi King merely told Trump that there was 2 mb/d of spare capacity that could be called upon if needed. Nevertheless, Trump's tweet led to a dip in oil prices on Monday as traders tried to figure out if Saudi Arabia planned on adding more oil than expected. In early trading on Tuesday, however, it seemed that expectations of a wave of supply subsided, with traders refocusing on the outages in Libya and Canada. WTI and Brent jumped more than 1 percent in early trading before falling back again.

Caribbean refinery to restart ahead of IMO regulations. An old shuttered refinery on the island of St. Croix will restart operations in 2019, leading to the production of 150,000 bpd of low-sulfur fuels ahead of sulfur regulations from the International Maritime Organization that take effect in 2020.

Conoco on temporary retreat from Permian. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) is redeploying assets away from the Permian to other shale basins as the West Texas shale fields have become too crowded and takeaway capacity is all but maxed out. ""Production has come on quicker in the Permian Basin, because the rigs were ramped up a lot faster than we would have thought maybe a year or a year and a half ago,"" Conoco CEO Ryan Lance told the FT. ""We have other opportunities to go spend our capital,"" Lance said. ""And I am not sure it makes sense to drill into that headwind."" Still, he noted that the pause on Conoco's activity in the Permian will be temporary.

Libya loses 850,000 bpd because of port outages. The internal battle for control of Libya's main crude oil export terminals has led to the National Oil Corp. to declare force majeure on loadings from the Zueitina and Hariga ports on Monday, leading to the disruption of 850,000 bpd. The sudden outage sent shockwaves through the oil market. ""Oil bulls seem to have returned after Libya suspended oil exports from two key ports,"" Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at futures brokerage FXTM, told Reuters. ""If Libya's oil doesn't return fast to the market it will be an important test to OPEC's spare capacity, especially given that output from Venezuela and Iran is expected to fall significantly in the next couple of months,"" he added.

Steep backwardation for WTI. The outage of 360,000 bpd from Syncrude Canada has led to a spike in WTI prices, raising fears of adequate short-term supply. The outage has also led to a sharp narrowing of the WTI discount relative to Brent, forcing the two benchmarks to converge. Moreover, the front-month WTI futures contract is now trading at an incredible $2-per-barrel premium to WTI two months out. The steep backwardation is an indication of market tightness.

Morgan Stanley hikes oil price forecast by $7.50 per barrel. Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for Brent oil prices by $7.50 per barrel to $85, on expectations of more outages from Angola, Iran and Libya. The investment bank is holding an $85-per-barrel target for the next 12 months.

Russia stepping up oil production. Russian oil companies are ""priming the pumps to significantly boost crude output this summer,"" according to the Wall Street Journal. Russia suggested it could add 200,000 bpd from current levels, although independent estimates of what Russia can achieve vary.

Deghayes was director of legal affairs at the Libyan oil ministry, and according to his LinkedIn profile, he is legal consultant at the National Oil Corporation (NOC) of Libya.

NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla has told an analyst that Deghayes did not advise the company and was not paid by the NOC.

""Omar Deghayes was employed by the previous Ministry of Oil. He returned to the UK after that. He is not paid by NOC, nor does he advise anybody at NOC,"" Sanalla said in a message sent to Claudia Gazzini, senior analyst for Libya at the International Crisis Group, and seen by The National.

Deghayes told The National in a written statement that the Libyan company was aware of his background.

Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, a civil war between feuding factions has crippled Libya's oil industry. Before the war, Libyan production was 1.6 million bpd. The North African oil producer has recently managed to lift and stabilize its production at around 1 million bpd, but risks still persist with rival factions fighting for control and suddenly disrupting oil facilities' operations and oil export terminals.

Libya was initially exempt from the OPEC production cuts together with Nigeria because of the violence in the two countries that had substantially reduced their oil production. At the meeting at which OPEC extended the pact until the end of 2018, Libya and Nigeria agreed to stick to an unofficial collective cap of 2.8 million bpd of oil production.

""There is no expertise in Russia. Rosneft tried to do it in-house. They're realizing you cannot replace the global oil service industry."" That conclusion was echoed by Rystad Energy late last month, which predicted that there was a dearth of new discoveries in Russia and even the discoveries that have been made over the past decade have not been given the greenlight because of cost and complexity. Rystad also predicted Russia's oil production would erode beyond 2020.

Libya's NOC withholding crude from Total. Total SA (NYSE: TOT) purchased a stake in the Waha oil field from Marathon Oil (NYSE: MRO), a $450 million deal that was closed in March, but Libya's National Oil Corp. is not handing over Total's share of crude cargoes from the project, according to Reuters. Libyan officials have some objections about the deal and it appears that the NOC is intervening and withholding cargoes as the dispute lingers.

11402514,2018-05-03,"Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) has been withholding the share of crude oil that is due Total over to an ongoing dispute over the French company's recent acquisition of a stake in the concession from U.S. Marathon Oil Corporation, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing Libyan industry and oil sources.

In early March, Total acquired the 16.33-percent stake of the Waha oil concessions held by Marathon Oil for US$450 million in cash. For Total, the deal was part of its strategy to continue to acquire low-cost resources in the Middle East, while Marathon Oil's exit from Libya was part of its strategy to simplify and concentrate its portfolio to the high-margin, high-return U.S. resource plays.

Total has already paid Marathon Oil for the stake, but Libya and its national oil company say that the deal needed approval from Libyan authorities and any attempt to conclude the deal prior to its approval would breach the concession agreement.

Total has not yet received any of its crude oil cargoes for its share of the Waha concession, nor has it received any compensation for those cargoes, Libyan oil and industry sources told Reuters.

On a conference call for the Q1 results last week, Total's chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said that the Libyan authorities had been informed well in advance about the Total-Marathon deal that they intended to close by the end of March.

""From a strictly legal point of view, neither in Libyan law nor in the oil concession agreement is there a request for a formal approval,"" Pouyanne said.

Loading programs for May at the Es Sider port that handles the cargoes from Waha show that out of 14 cargoes in total, Libya's NOC has 10, and the other partners in the concession apart from Total -- Hess and ConocoPhillips -- each have two, according to Reuters.

The future of North Africa's leading oil and gas producer Libya is once again under threat. International media reports that Libya's strongman General Khalifa Haftar, leader of the LNA, the largest and strongest military power in the country, has been hit by a stroke. Libyan and Arab news sites stumble over each other predicting the death or incapacitation of the Libyan military strongman, which would without doubt increase internal instability and could lead to a renewed power struggle in eastern Libya.

Political initiatives led by several Arab countries, the UN, U.S. and EU, are to all intense and purposes null and void at present, as without clarity about the power of the LNA these deals may well fall apart. A potential removal of Haftar from the delicate balance of power that has been created in Libya will also put anti-IS and Al Qaeda military operations in doubt.

The first signs of upheaval following the news of Hafar's stroke are already apparent, with the LNA's second-in-command, Abdelrazak Al Nadhuri, surviving a car bomb in Libya's eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday. The LNA reported that Al Nadhuri ""escaped unharmed from a terrorist assassination attempt after a car bomb exploded... as his convoy passed"" the Sidi Khalifa district at the eastern entrance to Benghazi. A Syrian and Sudanese national were caught in the explosion.

The attack came directly after the first press statements that Haftar had been hit by a stroke or was in coma. While Haftar has been largely out of the public eye in the last few weeks, French officials have reiterated that he is health and that he received a medical treatment in Paris.

The possible removal of Haftar will lead not only to unrest in his powerbase, the Eastern Region of Libya, but will likely cause instability within the LNA itself as the military strongman has not officially appointed any successor or second-in-command. A possible succession battle may take place between three potential successors that are reported to be waiting for their own chance to gain power.

Haftar's sons, Khaled and Saddam, each heading their own powerful and well-equipped brigades in the LNA, are slated to be first-in-line. Haftar's closest ally and cousin Oun Furjani, could also be vying for power. Some sources within the LNA also have stated that General Abdussalam al-Hasi, who is commander of special operations, could play a significant role.

Haftar will also be missed the upcoming military operations by the LNA, which is backed by Egypt, the UAE, and Russia, and the still existing Western Libya based Libyan government, which is supported by the EU and UN. In the south of Libya, Daesh and Al Qaeda are still powers to be reckoned with, while under the radar an old Libyan power player has emerged again. Saif Ghadaffi, son of the former Libyan dictator, has entered the political fray and has openly stated that he will be running for office in the next elections. Despite his father being forcibly removed from office, Saif Ghadaffi seems to be enjoying support in wide regions of Libya. Some groups have already stated that Saif could be the only politician with the power to reunite Libya and bring back stability and prosperity.

In the coming weeks, the situation in Libya will slowly become clear. If Haftar's role is over, the respective factions and militant groups will need to reassess their options. The Egypt-UAE LNA front will most probably survive but will struggle to replace Haftar. Other players, such as Qatar, EU/NATO and Russia will need to reassess their options once it become clear where power is held.

The Libyan situation will be of great concern to OPEC, as the oil group's projections are largely based on stability in the country being upheld by the LNA. A renewed instability will serve to severely impact Libya's ability to increase its production. Haftar's LNA is, at present, the main oil and gas power broker in the country, controlling the so-called ""oil crescent"" in the Gulf of Sirte. The LNA and its allies control not only the oil and gas production but also the export capabilities of the country, as they manage four major ports.

It is through its control of a majority of Libya's oil industry that the LNA has been able to increase production from 300-500,000 bpd to the current 1 million bpd. A power struggle would lead to lower production levels and export capacity. The most optimistic scenarios show that instability would remove around 200,000 bpd or more from the market. Looking at the current tightness of the oil market, that would cause oil prices to spike even higher. Some OPEC producers would be looking at such a scenario with a smile, but if oil prices go too high or spike too quickly we may see the same scenario that caused the last price collapse some years ago.

Increased instability in Libya is a very worrying sign for the region, with the possibility of a renewed implosion of governing structures. For the oil market, this geopolitical uncertainty, alongside the possible collapse of the Iran nuclear deal next month, is sure to drive oil prices higher. The bulls will be happy, but in the long-term, higher oil prices will boost not only U.S. shale volumes but also non-OPEC production. Not even Saudi Arabia, reportedly pushing for an oil price of $100 per barrel to support the Aramco IPO, will be happy with this situation.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Paris', 'United States', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Russia', 'France', 'Qatar', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Saudi Arabia']",The One Man Who Could Send Oil To $100 | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/The-One-Man-Who-Could-Send-Oil-To-100.html,None,

OPEC has come through some turbulent times in the last few years as oil prices fell to decade lows. It has implemented production cuts, has rallied Russia to climb onboard the production cut train, has weathered the rise of US shale to never-before-seen highs, has extended those production cuts, has lifted production to quell a nervous market post-Iranian sanctions, and then has managed to pull a rabbit out of a hat by agreeing to yet another production cut -- and OPEC is not finished yet.

As we approach the new year, the 15-member-strong OPEC is facing another set of challenges. Here are some of the challenges they will face in 2019:

Manuel Quevedo: OPEC's leadership is crucial to its success. It operates under a rotating presidency, and for 2019, that honor is bestowed upon none other than Venezuela's Manuel Quevedo.

Manuel Quevedo has zero oil industry experience, taking over Venezuela's crisis-stricken PDVSA and oil minister of the nation (which is pretty much the same thing). Instead, Quevedo's experience is with the military, serving as National Guard major general prior to his position as insta-oil czar in a country that is falling apart at the seams. Quevedo was appointed in late 2017 to right the wrong ship that is PDVSA -- and was given extra powers -- let's call it a special dispensation -- to ""create, annul or modify"" deals involving PDVSA its subsidiaries. His reign dispensed with nearly 70 PDVSA executives in a massive ""anti-corruption"" sweep that some have labeled a mere power grab, despite Maduro's insistence to the contrary.

Quevedo has been, so far, unable to right the ship, with Venezuela's oil production and oil revenues falling at unprecedented rates, even when oil prices rallied mid-year. Quevedo has instead instilled fear into PDVSA workers and has implemented some policies that some argue have brought PDVSA closer to -- not further from -- the brink of ruin.

A Maduro loyalist through and through, Quevedo will now take over not only PDVSA and Venezuela's oil industry, but will assume the rotating presidency of the most influential oil industry body in the world. But his lack of experience is only part of the trouble. OPEC has been the target of Tweets by US President Donald Trump -- add to that President Trump's vehement opposition to Maduro -- the subject of US sanctions -- and OPEC may find itself even more of a target. The worst thing for OPEC would be for Venezuela's tenuous relationship with Washington to mar OPEC's already tenuous relationship with Washington.

Related: UBS: Expect $80 Brent Next Year

Quevedo is also strongly backing El Petro -- its alleged oil-backed cryptocurrency -- and has supposedly been invited by OPEC to speak about the rise of El Petro sometime in 2019.

NOPEC: Another hurdle OPEC faces in 2019 is the proposed US legislation that would allow legal claims against OPEC for manipulating oil prices, called the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC) In mid-2018, OPEC advised its members to stop referring to oil prices specifically, instead urging them to use phrases such as ""balanced market"" and the like. OPEC's preemptive strike speaks to the plausibility that this legislation could be passed, as President Donald Trump's strained relationship with OPEC plays out on Twitter and in the legislative branch.

Qatar walked out of OPEC just one month ago, potentially distancing itself from this legislation that if passed, would open up a whole can of legal issues for the cartel as it would end anti-trust laws, revoking the sovereign immunity that until now has protected OPEC members from legal actions regarding price fixing.

Libya: Libya managed to secure an exemption from the OPEC production cuts that will go into effect on January 1, 2019, allegedly due to its unstable oil production that ebbs and flows as infighting continues to batter its oil industry like a plague. But this exemption, and its chronic outages of its largest oilfield, Sharara, poses a challenge to OPEC, who is struggling to balance production with demand. As Libya's production increases and decreases, OPEC has difficulty responding immediately to offset the ebbs and flows, and no single country has been fingered -- at least not to our knowledge -- to increase or decrease production to offset Libya's production. The unknowns with Libya create an unknown for all of OPEC.

Russia, et al: The non-OPEC signees of the deal to cut production expose OPEC to a greater risk. OPEC needs heavyweight Russia on board with the production cuts. Russia has agreed to cut production, along with several other lesser non-OPEC producers. But it has also said that it will be a gradual production cut, beginning in January but not reaching full cut volumes until March. Here, Russia holds some sway, exacerbated by its cozy relationship with Venezuela and major general Quevedo, who has been the recipient of substantial loans courtesy of Russia's generosity. OPEC has recruited Russia out of necessity, and being in bed with Russia exposes OPEC to greater risks. Should Russia renege on the deal with OPEC, the production cut agreement would be largely toothless.

Speculators: Oil prices still respond to OPEC chatter, leaked information, statements to the press, and monthly production figures that either show OPEC's success in hitting professed production targets. But the latter half of 2018 saw the beginning of a partial immunity to such news, and as the oil market continues its recently acquired anxiety disorder, 2019 is unlikely to look much different. What OPEC could previously achieve with a mere promise to curb production (or increase production), will now be met with increasing apathy -- show, don't tell will be the new norm for the oil market as traders work against OPEC, albeit unconsciously.

US Shale: The United States shale industry has been a thorn in OPEC's side since the cartel's initial ""pump oil until we crush them"" policy rolled out prior to its first round of production cuts in 2017. The rise of US shale will continue to be so throughout 2019 as production increases continue unabated. Unlike OPEC members, US shale producers are only inhibited by price, and even that has proven to be a nondeterrent to increasing production. For every barrel that OPEC doesn't produce, oil producers in the United States will happily export in its stead. The United States' entry as top dog when it comes to oil production at 11.7 million bpd toward the end of 2018 has taken much wind out of OPEC's sails, making it more difficult for OPEC to manipulate the market. This will continue throughout 2019.

OPEC will have an uphill battle in 2019, but its influence as a cartel should not be dismissed entirely. The oil market in 2019 will be largely affected by OPEC -- just not single-handedly by OPEC as other major players rise to sway the market as well.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Venezuela', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Libya', 'Qatar']",What's In Store For OPEC In 2019? | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Whats-In-Store-For-OPEC-In-2019.html,None,
11402758,2018-12-02,"Several crude oil terminals in Libya have been closed due to inclement weather, with oil production in the country already down by 150,000 bpd and likely to drop by a further 50,000 bpd, Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Friday.

The state oil firm confirmed today that four oil port terminals -- Ras Lanuf, Zueitina, Zawiya, and Es Sider -- are currently non-operational due to high waves. The Brega oil terminal may also have to suspend operations as of Friday afternoon local time, NOC said in a statement. Loading schedules at the currently closed oil terminals have been postponed, the company noted.

Libya's current oil production has already fallen by 150,000 bpd and is likely to be cut by another 50,000 bpd, due to lack of additional storage capacity at the closed ports.

""Projections based on the new production level indicate that Es Sider tanks will be full within two days. Should bad weather persist, 150,000 barrels of Sharara production could also be affected,"" NOC said.

Although it will disrupt Libya's oil production and loading schedules at the key ports, this time the closure is not due to violence, as it happened in June and July, when armed groups attacked the eastern oil ports in Libya, forcing a large part of Libya's oil production to shut in and NOC to declare force majeure for several weeks.

Following severe production and export disruptions in the early summer, Libya's oil production has been steadily rising over the past three months.

In August, production recovered to average 955,000 bpd, while Libya's production in September further jumped by 100,000 bpd to average 1.054 million bpd, and then by yet another 60,000 bpd to average 1.114 million bpd in October, as per data from OPEC's secondary sources.

The year is not yet over, but Libya's crude oil exports to China in value terms are already worth twice as much as what the North African country exported to China last year, the head of the National Oil Corporation said, as quoted by Reuters.

Since January, Libyan oil exports to China have hit a value of US$3.5 billion. This compares with US$1.7 billion for the whole of 2017 when Libyan fields suffered pretty much regular outages. This year has not been without outages and pipeline blockades either. Still, NOC and its partners have managed to weather the effects of these interruptions -- in one case involving as much as 850,000 bpd in production -- and expand Libya's production rate to 1.3 million bpd. Pans are to raise this further to 1.6 million bpd by the end of next year.

China will naturally be a top destination for this higher crude production, and NOC's Sanalla emphasized this during his recent meeting with the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Tripoli, saying he was ""rightly proud of our growing relations with China, and look forward to enhancing and broadening them further to serve the common interests of both the Libyan and Chinese oil sectors.""

Related: Oil Prices Set To Book Worst Month In A Decade

China will definitely be interested in that cooperation: its domestic oil production is falling and state oil companies are increasingly looking abroad for more own production. Libya is one of the countries that certainly makes sense as an investment destination with its huge oil reserves -- estimated to be the largest in Africa -- and eagerness to make the best of them as it has virtually no other major export commodity or product.

The situation in the country seems to be improving, too. The latest sign yet that things in Libya may be on the mend was the October announcement by BP and Eni that they will start drilling at a field they share in early 2019.

Libya's oil production has been steadily rising over the past two months, following severe production and export disruptions in June and July, when armed groups attacked the eastern oil ports in Libya, forcing a large part of Libya's oil production to shut in and NOC to declare a force majeure for several weeks.

In August, production recovered to average 950,000 bpd, while Libya's production in September further jumped by 103,000 bpd to average 1.053 million bpd, OPEC said in its October Monthly Oil Market Report.

As of the end of September, Libya's oil production hit its highest level since 2013, NOC's Sanalla said, adding that if the security situation in the country improves, production could further rise from the recent 1.278 million bpd.

11402761,2018-11-01,"Libya has restarted three small oil fields and added around 10,000 bpd to its oil production -- which has been steadily rising over the past two months -- a spokesman for Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) told Reuters on Wednesday.

Late on Tuesday, Libya restarted the al-Bayda oil field, an engineer told Reuters, while the NOC spokesman confirmed that the company also gave instructions for oil production at the Tibesti and Dor Marada oil fields to resume.

NOC has moved to resume oil production at these three small fields in southeastern Libya, which were shut in June when armed groups attacked the eastern oil ports in Libya, forcing a large part of Libya's oil production to shut in and NOC to declare force majeure for several weeks.

The port closure for more than two weeks in June-July blocked 850,000 bpd of Libya's oil (nearly all Libyan production) from being exported from four ports. As a result, Libya's oil production slumped to just 673,000 bpd in July, as per OPEC's secondary sources. In August, production recovered to an average 950,000 bpd, while Libya's production in September further jumped by 103,000 bpd to average 1.053 million bpd, OPEC said in its October Monthly Oil Market Report.

As of the end of September, Libya's oil production hit its highest level since 2013, NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla said, adding that if the security situation in the country improves, Libya's production could further rise from the recent 1.278 million bpd.

NOC is holding talks with international oil companies that could result in increased investment and production in Libya's oil industry, if security across the country improves, Sanalla said last month.

Earlier this month, Sanalla told Bloomberg that Libya's oil production could rise by several hundred thousand barrels daily when BP and Eni resume production at a shared field.

The Yemen Quagmire Just Got More Complicated

The timing of a Saudi airstrike on Yemen that killed 21 at a crowded marketplace will put further pressure on U.S.-Saudi relations, with Washington facing increasing pressure in the wake of the Khashoggi murder to step back from and punish Riyadh -- a move Washington is extremely hesitant to make. But Yemen is the proxy war venue for a Saudi-UAE-American war against Iran, and it is part and parcel of the unspoken U.S. containment policy.

But there's more tied up on the ground in Yemen than is apparent on the surface. Yemen's oil resources aren't Iraq's, or Libya's. Production is at a bare minimum, and civil war has ensured that development has been sidelined, but the prospect remains alluring, and whoever ends up controlling the oil and its export points wins this civil war. As such, Yemen's barrels are worth more than their volume in oil.

Right now, the Iranian-backed Houthis control Yemen's port of Hodeida, a gateway to the Bab el Mandeb Strait. In other words, Iran largely controls this strait through which nearly 5 million barrels per day of oil flow -- over half of it to Europe.

Saudi Arabia and Russia agree to extend cooperation. Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend their pact to manage oil production levels, according to comments from Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih. ""Saudi Arabia and Russia will interfere together, along with the heads of the other producing states, to prevent the market from falling out of balance,"" he said. This echoes his interview earlier this week in which he said he was looking to formalize a partnership with Russia within an official OPEC+ architecture.

OPEC ponders production cut as inventories rise. The fears of $100 oil seem long gone. OPEC suggested that it might need to cut output in 2019 to avoid a return of the supply glut. There are some mixed messages coming from the cartel. Earlier this week, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said that the group was in ""produce as much as you can mode."" But a technical committee offering recommendations to the OPEC+ group said that it would prepare ""options"" for production plans in 2019 to avoid a glut.

IEA urges more supply. Even as OPEC wonders whether or not it should cut output, the IEA pressed the cartel to increase production. ""Global oil markets are going through a very sensitive period -- global economic growth as well,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a Bloomberg interview on Thursday. ""If the oil producers care about the health of the growth of the global economy, which I believe they do, they should take the steps to further comfort the market.""

Libya aims for 1.6 mb/d. The head of Libya's National Oil Corp., Mustafa Sanalla, said that Libya is hoping to reach 1.6 mb/d by the end of next year, a level not seen since the days of dictator Muammar Qaddafi. Libya's production has been volatile since 2011, but seems to be on the upswing, having recently topped 1.25 mb/d. ""We've put together a plan to boost field production, including pipeline maintenance and addition of new pipelines,"" Sanalla said. ""We aim to reach 1.6 million barrels a day by the end of next year, and this level can increase.""

ConocoPhillips beats estimates. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) earned $1.36 per share in the third quarter, up more than eight-fold from the $0.16 per share a year earlier. Conoco's production in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken rose 48 percent to 313,000 bpd. The figures were a vote of confidence in the shale patch, where companies have struggled to earn a profit.

New York AG sues ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) was hit with another lawsuit this week when the New York Attorney General sued the company for allegedly defrauding investors. The fate of the case is unclear, but the suit poses a legal challenge to the oil major. The NY AG argues that Exxon defrauded investors by ""systematically"" undervaluing the risk that the company faces from future climate regulation. Exxon said the lawsuit lacks merit.

IMO reaffirms 2020 marine fuel regulations. The U.S. has been trying to delay the implementation of regulations on maritime fuels beyond the January 1, 2020 start date. However, the IMO dismissed the effort, and said that the regulations are set to go ahead as scheduled. Beginning in 2020, maritime ships will have use fuels with sulfur concentrations of just 0.5 percent, down from the current limit of 3.5 percent.

Tesla turns surprise profit. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) posted a third quarter profit, shocking Wall Street. It is the first quarterly profit in years, as well as its largest ever. Production of the beleaguered Model 3 increased in the third quarter, helping the company end several years of red ink. ""I've said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable,"" Elon Musk told reporters during a public conference call with analysts. ""This quarter was an important step towards that."" The electric car maker earned $311.5 million in the quarter, up from a $619.4-million loss a year earlier.

Big Oil lobbies against EV infrastructure. The American Petroleum Institute, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and Americans for Prosperity - three major oil lobbies - have weighed in at utility commissions in Illinois, Iowa and Kansas over the last few weeks, arguing against utilities investing in EV infrastructure, according to E&E News. Typically, an arcane affair and far out of the limelight, public utility commissions can decide whether or not to approve electricity rate increases for utility investments. The effort by the oil industry to block EV investments highlights their fear of losing market share as EVs proliferate.

Nigeria needs investment to keep production from falling. ""Nigeria's oil production is expected to remain stable in the short to medium term, with new projects offsetting the decline from mature fields. The timely development of these resources is seen as key for maintaining the country's oil supply,"" Rystad Energy said in a new report. Nigeria used to produce over 2 million barrels per day but instability has dropped that figure to about 1.7 mb/d. Production could return to about 2 mb/d in the medium-term but the timely development of new discoveries will be needed to keep production stable. Existing output is expected to erode in the years ahead.

11402764,2018-10-11,"Iran's crude oil production dropped by 371,000 bpd between the second quarter of this year -- when the U.S. announced the return of the sanctions -- and September, according to the secondary sources in OPEC's closely-watched Monthly Oil Market Report published on Thursday.

Iran's oil production in September plunged by 150,000 bpd from August to reach 3.447 million bpd last month. This compares to average Iranian production of 3.818 million bpd in the second quarter this year, as per OPEC's secondary sources, highlighting the fact that Iran has been cutting oil production, although not at the fast rate at which its exports have been dropping over the past two months.

Iran, for its part, claims a much smaller loss in its oil production -- Tehran self-reported to OPEC that its crude oil production in September stood at 3.755 million bpd, down by 51,000 bpd from August, when Iran self-reported production of 3.806 million bpd, compared to OPEC's secondary sources estimate of 3.597 million bpd for August. Iran's self-reported average production for the second quarter was 3.804 million bpd.

Among all OPEC members, Iran booked the steepest decline in production in September, followed by another slump in Venezuela -- this time by 42,000 bpd to below the 1.2-million-bpd mark -- 1.197 million bpd, according to secondary sources.

Other OPEC members, however, almost entirely compensated for the loss of production in Iran and Venezuela -- OPEC's total production increased by 132,000 bpd in September to 32.761 million bpd. OPEC's biggest producer Saudi Arabia opened up the taps to add 108,000 bpd of production last month, lifting output to 10.512 million bpd. Riyadh's self-reported number is very close to the secondary sources -- 10.502 million bpd.

Another big jump came from Libya, whose oil production continues to recover after a turbulent summer with port blockades and severely curtailed production. Libya's production rose by 103,000 bpd to average 1.053 million bpd, as per secondary sources. Angola and Nigeria also contributed to the cartel's higher production.

OPEC's efforts to boost supply were helped by its key partner in the deal with the non-OPEC nations -- Russia. Production in Russia hit a post-Soviet record at 11.54 million bpd in September, up by 150,000 bpd from August, OPEC said, citing preliminary estimates.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Iran', 'Tehran', 'Venezuela', 'Riyadh', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Libya', 'Russia', 'Nigeria', 'Angola']",OPEC Turns On The Taps To Counter Iranian Outages | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/OPEC-Turns-On-The-Taps-To-Counter-Iranian-Outages.html,None,
11402765,2018-10-08,"Oil prices cooled off in recent days as fears of an acute shortage of supply stemming from sanctions on Iran started to subside.

At least two companies in India have lined up oil shipments for November, the month that sanctions on Iran take effect. The 9 million barrels of oil secured for next month translate into nearly 300,000 bpd of supply. Meanwhile, other reports suggest that the U.S. is softening its zero tolerance approach to sanctions, and could issue waivers to some importers who make significant reductions but struggle to cut imports to zero. Taken together, the oil market is not nearly as concerned about a supply shortfall as it was as recently as last week.

In fact, the precise amount of Iranian supply lost to sanctions could determine quite a bit. ""If the declines in Iran exports are sooner and larger than our base case, it will be harder for other producers to offset them,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a note last week. The uncertainty lies with the exact amount of supply lost from Iran, and the uncertainty over whether or not there is enough spare capacity to compensate.

However, if Iranian supply declines by less than expected, then there is much more downside risk for oil prices, especially since there are other reasons to be a lot less worried about a supply crunch. ""While upside price risks will prevail for now, fundamental data outside of Iran has not turned bullish in our view,"" Goldman wrote, citing the surge in Saudi production over the last few months, which increased global inventories counter-seasonally. In other words, the market is heading into a softer demand season with larger stockpiles than otherwise would have been the case, offering some buffer in the event of a supply deficit.

Also, some of the oil producers that have typically accounted for unexpected outages - namely, Libya and Nigeria - have actually restored output and have (so far) sustained those gains. Libya's production is reportedly up to as high as 1.25 million barrels per day. ""Our current production is 1.25 million barrels (per day). We have ambitions to increase it further,"" Mustafa Sanalla, CEO of the National Oil Corporation of Libya, told reporters on the sidelines of the Russian Energy Week.

Taken together, Libya and Nigeria are producing 0.3 mb/d more than expected, Goldman Sachs estimates, which offsets a portion of the losses in Iran. Iraq too could add more supply. These production gains are always tenuous, but for now they are holding up.

The futures curve also offers a bit of evidence to suggest that the market is not extraordinarily tight. Timespreads in the Atlantic basin have been declining, which ""suggests local oversupply,"" not tightness, Goldman wrote.

If the market can make it through the next few months, and Iranian supply does not fall as far as some fear, then we will transition into a softer period. For one, demand slows in winter months. But supply is also expected to pick up. U.S. shale will continue to add production, although at a slower rate. Spare capacity will also come back a bit, Goldman says.

These arguments are all subject to what happens with the timing and the magnitude of the outages in Iran. ""The two key uncertainties the oil market has to grapple with are first the spare capacity to replace Iranian barrels and, second, the unknown magnitude of these lost volumes due to a lack of clarity from the U.S. administration,"" Goldman analysts wrote in their report. ""Our base case remains for a loss of 1.5 million b/d (4Q18 vs. 2Q18)...Through end-September, 0.7 mb/d of Iran exports have been lost, compensated by higher production levels from other OPEC+ members.""

The next wave of losses could push the market into a deficit, perhaps as high as 0.4 mb/d. That isn't a necessarily a disaster because of the counter-seasonal build in inventories over the last few months, Goldman argues. As long as everything else holds up and there are not additional outages, prices may remain subdued.

Oil production in Iran dropped by 100,000 bpd from August to stand at 3.45 million bpd in September, the survey found, while Venezuela's production further dropped to 1.25 million bpd last month from 1.30 million bpd in August.

These losses resulted in the 12 OPEC members bound by the supply cut deal -- all OPEC members excluding Libya and Nigeria and recently joined Congo -- actually pumping 70,000 bpd less in September than in August, according to the Reuters survey, which suggests that the core OPEC members are not doing 'everything it takes' to fill in the gap in supply declines in Iran and Venezuela.

Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader and largest producer, pumped 10.53 million bpd in September, up by 50,000 bpd from August, according to the Reuters survey.

Libya's production continued to recover in September and averaged above 1 million bpd -- at 1.05 million bpd it was above the average August production of 920,000 bpd.

Libya's oil sector went through a turbulent June and July when an oil ports blockade curtailed production to 721,000 bpd in June and to 670,000 bpd in July, according to OPEC's secondary sources.

In September, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) -- which had increased their production in July immediately after OPEC and allies decided to 'ease compliance rate' -- held their production steady compared to August, the Reuters survey found.

Angola's production, which had been declining in recent months, jumped by 70,000 bpd in September due to the start of a new field, but Angola's output is still well below its OPEC baseline target.

OPEC's figures on the cartel's September production are due out on October 11 with this month's Monthly Oil Market Report.

Libya's oil production has hit its highest level since 2013, the chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), Mustafa Sanalla, told Bloomberg in response to questions on Sunday.

If the security situation in the country improves, Libya's production could further rise from the recent 1.278 million bpd, Sanalla said. The country could lift production by ""hundreds of thousands"" of barrels of oil per day, security permitting, according to the head of the national oil company.

However, the situation in Libya remains uncertain, which could prompt the national oil firm to revise down its production target to pump more than 2 million bpd in 2022, according to Sanalla.

Over the past few months, Libya's oil production has seen wild fluctuations as a result of attacks and blockades on oil facilities that have frequently shut in oil production and exports.

Just last week, members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) blocked the airfield of the Wafaa oil field in southwestern Libya, attempting to blackmail the operator of the field into awarding an unwarranted catering contract. The runway at the oil field reopened after one day, with no production affected. This latest incident at a Libyan oil field, however, highlights the fragile state of the oil industry in the North African OPEC member.

Earlier this month, several gunmen stormed NOC's headquarters in Tripoli, killing two employees and injuring 25 others.

A port closure for more than two weeks in June-July blocked 850,000 bpd of Libya's oil (nearly all Libyan production) from being exported from four ports.

Libya's July oil production slumped to just 670,000 bpd, as per OPEC's secondary sources. In August, production recovered to average 926,000 bpd, according to OPEC's latest monthly report, but the security situation in the country is still fragile, making Libya one of the wild cards in predicting supply in a tightening oil market.

According to S&P Global Platts trade flow data, Libya's oil exports jumped to more than 1 million bpd in the first half of September, up from just below 900,000 bpd in August, as a 120,000-bpd refinery is shut due to power issues, thus freeing more oil for exports.

Total OPEC-15 oil production came in at 32.89 million bpd last month, including 320,000 bpd output from its newest member, Congo, which joined OPEC in June this year.

Excluding Congo, OPEC pumped 32.57 million bpd in August, the highest level since October 2017, the Platts survey found.

Libya boosted production the most, as fields and oil export terminals returned to operation after the attack on the Oil Crescent in June that crippled the country's oil production and exports in both June and July. Libya's production recovered to 940,000 bpd, according to the Platts survey.

OPEC's no.1 and de facto leader Saudi Arabia saw its production average 10.49 million bpd in August. That number is up from the Saudi production in July, as per official OPEC figures, 10.387 million bpd.

Last week, an OPEC source told S&P Global Platts that Saudi Arabia would report to OPEC that its crude oil production in August averaged 10.424 million bpd.

OPEC's no.2 Iraq -- including the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region -- produced 4.68 million bpd last month, up by 110,000 bpd over July, and the highest Iraqi production in the 30 years of Platts OPEC surveys.

OPEC's no.3 Iran is already seeing the impact of the U.S. sanctions not only on its exports, but also on its production. According to the Platts survey, Iran's production in August was 3.6 million bpd, down by 120,000 bpd from July. Platts Analytics expects U.S. sanctions to remove around 1.4 million bpd of Iranian oil from the market by November.

Last month, OPEC produced an average of 32.66 million bpd of crude oil, including production from its newest member the Republic of Congo, the survey of shipping data, industry officials, and analysts found.

The biggest OPEC producer, Saudi Arabia, pumped 10.63 million bpd in July, up by 240,000 bpd from June and its highest level since its record of 10.66 million bpd from August 2016, according to Platts survey archives.

The Saudi allies Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) boosted their production as well, to the highest since December 2016, just before the OPEC+ production pact entered into force. Kuwait pumped 2.78 million bpd and the UAE produced 2.97 million bpd in July. Iraq and Algeria also raised their oil production. The rising production in those countries offset declines in Iran, Venezuela, and Libya.

Iran's production dropped to 3.72 million bpd in July -- its lowest level since January 2017 -- as buyers from Europe started to wind down purchases ahead of the returning U.S. sanctions in November.

Crisis-stricken Venezuela saw its production plummet for yet another month, by 60,000 bpd to 1.24 million bpd in July. This level is 670,000 bpd lower compared to a year earlier and Venezuela's lowest production in the 30-year history of the Platts OPEC survey, except when a worker strike in late 2002 and early 2003 temporarily stymied Venezuelan production.

Libya's production declined 30,000 bpd to 670,000 bpd -- its lowest since April 2017, after a militia blockade at its eastern ports that had blocked production and exports was resolved on July 11, when the country reopened the oil ports in its Oil Crescent.

In this week's newsletter, we will take a quick look at some of the critical figures and data in the energy markets this week.

We will then look at some of the key market movers early this week before providing you with the latest analysis of the top news events taking place in the global energy complex over the past few days. We hope you enjoy.

- Fossil fuels, which include coal, oil and natural gas, have accounted for more than 80 percent of U.S. energy consumption for over a century.

- Last year, that share dropped to its lowest since 1902 at just over 80 percent.

- Natural gas consumption fell by 1.4 percent in 2017 (likely an aberration), while coal consumption fell by 2.5 percent, a modest decline after losses of 13.6 percent and 8.5 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

- Petroleum use increased last year but is still down 10 percent from its peak in 2005.

Market Movers

- BP (NYSE: BP) was selected by RBC Capital for its ""best ideas"" list, with RBC upgrading the British oil company's outlook to Outperform, citing one of the strongest growth profiles out of its peers through 2020. ""The visibility around BP's volume growth to the early 2020s should reassure investors that BP does not need to raise capex materially in order to rejuvenate the upstream hopper,"" RBC analysts write.

- Transocean (NYSE: RIG) was upgraded by Susquehanna to Positive with a $16 price target. ""Offshore floater contracting activity has begun to rebound, and we believe more positive commentary across several of the companies suggests the industry is beginning to heal, and better utilization could be ahead in 2019 and 2020,"" Susquehanna says.

Oil prices jumped in early trading on Tuesday on fresh concerns about supply outages. Strikes in Norway and Gabon knocked off more supply, Canada's outage looks set to last longer than previously expected and the U.S. has reiterated its hardline stance on Iran. Brent jumped by more than 1 percent on Tuesday, putting it within reach of $80 per barrel.

Norway's oil and gas workers on strike. Hundreds of workers in Norway have gone on strike after rejecting a proposed wage deal, disrupting production at least one offshore oil project - Royal Dutch Shell's (NYSE: RDS.A) Knarr field. The disruption adds to the series of outages around the world and helped push up prices on Tuesday. ""As a result of the strike, Knarr is closing its production in the Norwegian North Sea,"" said Shell spokeswoman Kitty Eide.

Gabon workers strike. Oil workers in Gabon began a 15-day workers strike at the facilities of Total SA (NYSE: TOT) due to wage demands. Gabon produces about 200,000 bpd.

OPEC president says group is not to blame for high prices. OPEC's president deflected blame over the recent surge in oil prices. ""OPEC alone cannot be blamed for all the problems that are happening in the oil industry, but at the same time we were responsive in terms of the measures we took in our latest meeting in June,"" OPEC president Suhail al-Mazrouei told Reuters. ""I feel OPEC is doing its part."" The defense came in response to a series of accusations from U.S. President Donald Trump that OPEC has been manipulating oil prices.

Iran supply likely disrupted as Asian refiners cutback. U.S. sanctions are already starting to impact Iran's oil exports as Asian refiners cutback ahead of the November deadline. South Korea is aiming to eliminate purchases in August, while Japan could cut off imports after September. ""It's the Trump administration that we are dealing with, and that unpredictability is stoking concern among refiners and petrochemical companies in Asia, making them voluntarily cut their shipments from Iran before the deadline,"" Kim Jae Kyung, a research fellow at Korea Energy Economics Institute, told Bloomberg.

Libya production falls to 527,000 bpd. ""Today, production is 527,000 barrels a day, tomorrow it will be lower, and after tomorrow it will be even lower and everyday it will keep falling,"" Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp., said in a video statement posted on the company's Facebook page. Several key oil export terminals remain offline as the army commander that took them over has decided to put them under control of a rival NOC based in the east.

Mexico's president aims to end foreign fuel imports in three years. Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says a top priority will be ending the country's large and growing dependence on refined fuels from the United States within three years. He wants to refurbish some of Mexico's decrepit refineries while building a handful of new ones from scratch. He also wants to halt the decline of Mexico's crude oil production. Mexico has averaged 590,000 bpd of imported gasoline so far this year, which is up by about two-thirds since 2013.

Permian pipeline build raises fears of too much capacity. Midstream companies are scrambling to build out pipeline capacity to ease the bottlenecks in the Permian basin. But with several pipelines coming online at the same time in late 2019, analysts are starting to worry about an overbuild, even as the basin is suffocating today from a dearth of capacity. By late 2019, takeaway capacity from the Permian will spike, jumping by 2 mb/d. Current capacity stands at 2.9 mb/d. Until then, crude in Midland is selling at a steep discount relative to WTI in Houston or Cushing.

The pipeline feeding crude from the Waha oil field into Libya's Es Sider export terminal has been shut down for repairs after a fire broke out during the weekend.

An early report by Reuters cited a source from the pipeline operator Waha Oil Company who said the pipeline had been attacked by ""a terrorist group."" Later, parent company NOC tweeted that preliminary investigation of the fire confirmed that the cause of the fire was a deliberate attack on the pipeline.

Repairs should last a few days, NOC also said, with the loss of production during the period estimated at 80,000 bpd. Waha Oil operates the same-name field in partnership with ConocoPhillips, Total, and Hess. The field last month produced an average 300,000 bpd, the same as Libya's largest field, Sharara -- itself the target of several deliberate outages.

This is the second attack on the pipeline over the last five months. Last time, repairs led to the same loss of production.

Libya's production and oil transport infrastructure in general is often the target of attacks by various militant groups seeking to gain an edge over rivals in the chaos that is Libyan politics right now. Because of this, the country is considered an important swing factor for oil prices.

Recently, there has been another factor contributing to the North African country's significance for oil markets: General Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the LNA, which two years ago wrested control over Libya's four oil export terminals from the Petroleum Facilities Guard.

There were reports recently that Haftar has serious health problems, with some media even claiming that he was dead. Some industry observers believe that Haftar's death could send oil to US$100 a barrel as any semblance of order in Libya breaks down into chaos once again, undoubtedly leading to more production outages and pipeline blockades.",OilPrice.com,energy,,['Libya'],Terror Attack Shuts Down Libyan Oil Pipeline | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Terror-Attack-Shuts-Down-Libyan-Oil-Pipeline.html,None,

Despite an onslaught of bearish news for crude, oil prices remained stable before jumping significantly on Friday morning.

OPEC acknowledged this week that U.S. shale production was rising quickly, and suggested that supply growth would surpass demand this year. Trump's recent tariffs have created fears of a global trade war, inventory declines have slowed and the rig count has risen once again. Despite all this bearish news, oil prices jumped on Friday, with WTI breaking above $62 and Brent nearing $66.

Saudi Arabia indicates commitment to OPEC cuts. Saudi Arabia dismissed concerns of a fraying OPEC deal, stating that the country would remain committed to the production limits this year. The response came after the Iranian oil minister suggested his country wanted to ramp up production, sparking speculation that the OPEC deal could begin to suffer, but Saudi Aramco said on Wednesday that its output would remain below 10 million barrels per day (mb/d). ""Saudi Arabia continues to lead by example by producing below the production targets it agreed to,"" the Saudi energy ministry said in the news release. That statement was unusual because the company typically does not publish what it will produce ahead of time.

U.S. accuses Russia of cyberattacks against power plants. The Trump administration accused Russia of staging cyberattacks against U.S. and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems. Russia had allegedly compromised some power plants by the spring of 2017 and could have disrupted their operations. ""We now have evidence they're sitting on the machines connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage,"" said Eric Chien, a security technology director at Symantec, according to the New York Times. ""From what we can see, they were there. They have the ability to shut the power off. All that's missing is some political motivation.""

EPA signals fight with California over fuel efficiency standards. The U.S. EPA chief Scott Pruitt indicated that the agency would battle with California over the state's tighter fuel efficiency requirements for passenger vehicles. The EPA has an April 1 deadline to decide whether or not it wants to try to revise Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks for model years 2022-2025. California has often led the nation in such standards, which have been credited with dramatically improving the efficiency of the nation's auto fleet and slowing the growth of gasoline consumption.

Trump admin staff shakeups. President Trump kicked off what appears to be a significant overhaul of his cabinet this week, sacking Rex Tillerson in favor of CIA Director Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. That move has raised fears of a more belligerent foreign policy, which could put Iranian oil at risk later this year. Meanwhile, there are rumors that Trump was considering moving Secretary of Energy Rick Perry over to Veterans Affairs, although that wasn't a done deal. Also, EPA chief Scott Pruitt has reportedly been angling for the Attorney General job should the president force out current AG Jeff Sessions. However, again, nothing is certain at this time.

West Virginia orders halt of construction of Rover pipeline. West Virginia regulators ordered Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE: ETP) to stop construction on the 700-mile Rover pipeline, which would carry 3.25 billion cubic feet of natural gas from West Virginia and Ohio to Michigan. Regulators cited multiple water pollution violations.

Iraq struggling to attract new investment. Iraq has had ambitious goals of ratcheting up oil production in the years ahead, but the low margins in the country are deterring international companies from making new investments. Many companies lowered their production targets in 2013 and 2014 and might have to lower them again as investment stays on the sidelines, according to Reuters. Iraq added around 2.5 million barrels per day of new supply over the past decade, but growth has stalled out in the past few years. ""There are alternatives in tight oil and deepwater from many of the Iraq players that are more favorable,"" Ian Thom, principal analyst at WoodMac, told Reuters. Iraq is getting close to having the capacity to produce 5 mb/d, and could still expand supply by another 10 percent, but that is a far cry from the 12 mb/d the country had once hoped to produce by the end of the decade.

OPEC acknowledges shale growth. OPEC sharply revised up its forecast for U.S. shale growth this year, an admission that rival non-OPEC production is set to growth significantly. The group said the U.S. would produce 260,000 bpd more than previously thought, and that total global supply would rise faster than demand this year. Meanwhile, the IEA issued a mostly unchanged forecast from last month, but said that Venezuela's sharp decline could push the oil market into deficit in 2018.

Statoil changes name to Equinor in nod to green energy. Norway's Statoil (NYSE: STO) announced a name change to Equinor, which would reflect a greater focus on renewable energy. The prefix ""equi"" is supposed to represent equal or equality, an indication that the company would focus on many types of energy production and not just oil and gas. From a marketing standpoint, many analyst panned the name change, but others see it as a sign of the changing times.

U.S. Commerce to release details on tariff exclusions. The Trump administration has indicated it would be reluctant to grant exemptions to U.S. companies from tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and would only do so on a rigorous case for national security. That is an ominous sign for the oil and gas industry, which desperately wants a waiver. Many projects upstream, midstream and downstream require a type of steel that is hard to come by in the United States. For instance, imported steel made up 77 percent of the steel used in pipelines, according to an industry study. The Trump administration is set to release details on the exemption process this week or next week.

Libya oil looks steady. Libya suffered some temporary setbacks recently at a handful of oil projects, but the country's output has proved resilient.

11402773,2018-02-26,"In the long-term, many oil analysts expect the world to become increasingly dependent on oil production from the Middle East, as U.S. shale fades in importance. However, geopolitical turmoil is already causing disruptions in major oil-producing countries in the Middle East, raising questions about the region's ability to supply the global market in the long run.

The IEA has repeatedly warned that while U.S. shale has led to oversupply in the short run, shale output cannot meet future demand by itself. By the mid-2020s, especially because there are questions about the longevity of U.S. shale, there could be a much greater reliance on the Middle East, just as there was in the past.

However, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES), the deteriorating geopolitical landscape in the Middle East could leave longstanding scars on the region's energy sector.

Geopolitical threats are cropping up in various ways in the Middle East and North Africa. Formal institutions have been weakened, and in places like Libya, Yemen and Syria there is an absolute lack of legitimacy in government. Non-state actors have stepped into the void, such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, Libya Dawn, and others, according to OIES. These rivaling power centers make it tricky for oil companies and oilfield services to make investments.

As far as the oil market goes, these geopolitical problems are not obvious just yet. The glut of U.S. shale has inoculated the oil market from instability and unrest for the time being. Also, while there are plenty of sources of conflict and no shortage of potential threats, actual oil production outages have remained minimal. In fact, Iran ramped up production after the removal of international sanctions, while Libya, and Nigeria restored quite a bit of output after serious outages.

Nevertheless, geopolitical flashpoints are sowing the seeds of future supply problems, OIES argues. For instance, as tension bubbles, Middle Eastern governments are stepping up spending on security and defense, and the ballooning expenditures translate into higher revenue requirements. That means that a lot of key oil producers will need higher oil prices for their budgets to breakeven.

Moreover, geopolitical tension today is preventing the necessary investments in new production capacity. For example, while Iran was able to restore huge volumes of upstream production after the lifting of sanctions, the Trump administration seems set on ratcheting up tensions. It is unclear where this conflict is heading, but it is already deterring investment in oil and gas production capacity in Iran. French oil company Total is trying to invest in the South Pars Phase 2 project, but has suggested it might hesitate if U.S. sanctions returned.

Meanwhile, tension elsewhere has also inhibited investment in production capacity. For years, the Kurdish Regional Government has tried to attract upstream investment, but the conflict with the central government in Baghdad will prevent the region from scaling up output.

OIES also cites the case of Libya, where unrest is not only leading to the occasional outage today, but it essentially prevents the country from realizing its full potential. OIES pointed out that in a 2005 forecast, the IEA predicted Libya would ramp up output to 3 million barrels per day by 2030. That seems unrealistic at this point, and Libya's production is down from its pre-war level of 1.6 million barrels per day (mb/d) and is now stuck at around 1 mb/d.

While this may not seem like an acute problem today, geopolitical instability becomes increasingly problematic as the oil market tightens. Already, the cushion of crude inventories has been significantly reduced. Any unexpected outage becomes more influential in a tighter market.

That is especially true because spare capacity is already thin, sitting at about 2 million barrels per day, which is at the low end historically. But spare capacity will shrink further once OPEC unwinds the current production cuts. As the oil market tightens, and absorbs new OPEC production, the EIA predicts that global spare capacity will fall to about 1.24 mb/d by the third quarter of 2019, an extremely low level.

As the years pass and demand rises, the global market will need more OPEC production. But as OIES argues, geopolitical turmoil today could prevent the group from bringing new supply online in the future.

In the near-term, the oil market will be well supplied with rising shale output and the prospect of the return of OPEC production. But there are some serious questions about supply problems in the long-term.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'Yemen', 'Syria', 'Nigeria', 'Baghdad']",Geopolitical Risk Is On The Rise In Oil Markets | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/Geopolitical-Risk-Is-On-The-Rise-In-Oil-Markets.html,None,
11402774,2018-02-09,"Libya's oil production averaged more than 1 million bpd in January, for the first time topping the million-bpd-mark for a full month since July 2013, data provider Genscape has estimated.

Last month Libya produced 1.083 million bpd of crude oil, and 1.133 million of total liquids, Genscape said, adding that its oil production monitoring showed that oil fields in Libya appeared to operate relatively consistently in January, without steep, significant dips below the average production levels due to weather or pipeline attacks.

The years-long civil strife crippled most of Libya's oil production, which slumped well below the 1.6-million-bpd the country was pumping before the 2011 uprising. Libya, as well as Nigeria, won an exemption from the initial production cut deal that OPEC and a dozen non-OPEC producers forged at the end of 2016.

After the main fields and oil export terminals in Libya re-opened in 2017, production started to increase, and together with Nigeria's recovering oil production and U.S. shale resurgence, was offsetting part of the OPEC cuts and depressed oil prices for much of 2017. Libya's production topped 1 million bpd in July 2017, but the country has struggled to maintain that level consistently for a month.

When OPEC met to extend the production cuts in November 2017, Libya and Nigeria agreed to cap their respective 2018 oil production at a combined level of 2.8 million bpd, as part of their contribution to the pact.

In December, Libya's oil production averaged 962,000 bpd, according to the latest available figures by OPEC's secondary sources. Production for January is due out in the OPEC monthly report next Monday, February 12.

The monthly survey of S&P Global Platts -- one of OPEC's secondary sources -- showed this week that Libya's oil production averaged 980,000 bpd in January, flat compared to December.

IEA: Explosive growth in U.S. shale will test oil prices. The IEA's latest Oil Market Report paints a mixed picture for prices. Clearly, the market is tightening, the IEA says, but it also says that shale growth will be ""explosive"" this year. The agency revised up its forecasts growth for U.S production from 870,000 bpd to 1.1 mb/d in 2018. That, combined with gains from other non-OPEC countries, could end the price rally, although the IEA says a lot of uncertainty remains.

Venezuelan oil production plunges by over 200,000 bpd. Venezuela's December output cratered to 1.6 million barrels per day (mb/d), falling by 216,000 bpd from a month before. The shocking single-month decline raises the prospect of a much more serious meltdown in the country's oil sector than most analysts previously believed. Debt, lack of maintenance, a lack of cash to invest, the decrepit state of PDVSA's oil assets, and a brain drain are all contributing to the steep decline. Analysts see output falling to 1.3 mb/d this year, perhaps lower. ""The only discussion right now is how much is it going to decline by. There is no talk of a turnaround,"" Luisa Palacios, analyst at consultancy Medley Global Advisors in New York, told the WSJ.

Permian bottleneck looming. Argus Media reports that surging oil production in the Permian could run into a ceiling of midstream capacity in the coming years, threatening the boom. For now, there is enough pipeline capacity to carry Permian oil to the Gulf Coast, but at some point the pipeline network will be maxed out, and there is ""going to be a day of reckoning,"" Enterprise Products Partners senior vice president Brent Secrest said at the Argus Americas Crude Summit in Houston, Texas. Pipeline companies see the bottleneck beginning in 2019 or 2020.

Royal Dutch Shell and BP agree to buy Libyan oil. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) and BP (NYSE: BP) agreed to annual contracts to purchase oil from Libya, a sign that the North African OPEC member is continuing its recovery after years of war. Libya's oil output has been rebounding for more than a year, but buyers have been wary from unstable shipments. Shell's deal with Libya's National Oil Corp. was ""the first of its kind since 2013,"" Bloomberg reports. Libya's production has climbed to 1 mb/d from less than half of that amount in 2016.

EIA: U.S. shale to jump by 111,000 bpd in February. The latest EIA Drilling Productivity Report predicts a rise in shale production by 111,000 bpd in February. The gains will be led by the Permian (+76,000 bpd), the Eagle Ford (+15,000 bpd), and smaller contributions from other shale basins. Meanwhile, the drilled but uncompleted well (DUC) list continues to mushroom, rising to nearly 7,500 in December, a monthly gain of 156 wells. Part of the backlog is thought to be the result of a shortage of fracking crews and other bottlenecks.

OPEC revises up shale expectations. In its monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC acknowledged that U.S. shale is growing faster than it previously thought. The group revised up its forecast for U.S. oil production growth this year to 1.15 mb/d, an increase of 160,000 bpd from last month's report. The revision indicates that the OPEC cuts are helping tighten the market, but the knock-on effect is that it is providing more leeway to shale producers, something the cartel had hoped to avoid.

TransCanada eyes 2019 to break ground on Keystone XL. TransCanada (NYSE: TRP) said that it received enough commitments from buyers for the capacity on its controversial Keystone XL pipeline for it to move forward with construction. The Canadian pipeline company said that it has interest in 500,000 bpd of oil shipments for 20 years, enough for the project to move forward. TransCanada hopes to begin construction next year, although it still has not made a final investment decision. There are still some obstacles in Nebraska, where regulators recently approved an alternative route through their state, not the one preferred by the pipeline company. That means TransCanada has some more permits to obtain.

BP inks deal with Iraq for Kirkuk. BP (NYSE: BP) signed an initial agreement with the Iraqi government to ramp up production at a Kirkuk oil field, according to the FT. ""The fields in Kirkuk have a [current] capacity of about 450,000 b/d at the moment but are only producing around 150,000 b/d,"" Alan Mohtadi, head of T&S Consulting Energy and Security, told the FT. The deal comes several months after the central government retook Kirkuk from the Kurds. It also comes just days after Chevron (NYSE: CVX) said it would return to Kurdistan to increase production.

After a strong start to 2018, oil prices fell back slightly on Friday morning. While geopolitical tensions and strong inventory drawdowns were the main culprits for the rise in prices, a strong build in gasoline stocks slowed both WTI and Brent's momentum.

Oil prices fell back on Friday during early trading after posting strong gains for much of the week. The tension in Iran has helped push prices up, and a strong U.S. crude inventory drawdown added some momentum on Thursday, although that bullish data was slightly offset by the large build in gasoline stocks. Overall, by Friday, it appeared that oil traders had sold off some positions to pocket some of the recent gains. The breather raises questions about the durability of the current rally.

Trump admin seeks to open nearly all U.S. coastal areas to drilling. The Trump administration has proposed to open up vast new territory for offshore oil and gas drilling, going so far as to push drilling in areas currently off limits, including the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific Oceans, as well as parts of the Gulf of Mexico that haven't seen drilling. The five-year plan for 2019-2024 would replace the Obama-era plan for 2017-2022, and it would include 47 possible auctions that encompass more than 90 percent of the U.S. outer continental shelf. The proposal will take time to finalize and would be vulnerable to legal challenges.

Rising confidence in oil stocks. Energy stocks have significantly lagged behind the broader stock market, underperforming even in a period in which oil prices rebounded. But 2018 could be different. With oil prices at their highest level since mid-2015, the outlook looks better for energy stocks than it has in some time. On top of that, a long list of companies have trimmed costs and the oil majors have returned to positive cash flow. This has more investors gaining confidence in the investment case of oil and gas stocks. ""2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,"" Olivia Markham, portfolio manager at BlackRock Commodities Income Investment Trust, told Reuters. According to Reuters, investment banks UBS, RBC and JP Morgan issued strongly positive outlooks for the oil and gas sector in recent weeks, while Barclays predicted European integrated oil companies could rise 20 percent from the third quarter. Others agree. ""Annus Mirabilis. Highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,"" Bernstein said, referring to its prediction for European oil majors.

EV sales in Norway outpace gasoline and diesel. In Norway, EVs captured 52 percent of auto sales last year, beating out conventional vehicles fueled by gasoline and diesel. With EVs taking a majority of auto sales, Norway is cementing itself as a global leader in the switch to EVs. Norway offers generous incentives for EVs, which make them cheaper than buying a conventional vehicle. Norwegian auto experts told the New York Times that the market share for EVs would have been even higher except that some potential buyers are waiting for Tesla's (NYSE: TSLA) Model 3.

Tesla reports setback in Model 3 production. Tesla (NYSE: TSLA) released production figures on Wednesday, which revealed a disappointing performance for the fourth quarter. ""As we continue to focus on quality and efficiency rather than simply pushing for the highest possible volume in the shortest period of time, we expect to have a slightly more gradual ramp through Q1, likely ending the quarter at a weekly rate of about 2,500 Model 3 vehicles,"" Tesla said in a press release. ""We intend to achieve the 5,000 per week milestone by the end of Q2."" It is the latest delay in its production schedule, and yet another downward revision. Tesla's shares fell by 2 percent on the news, but Wall Street has yet to sour on the electric car company. Still, as Bloomberg Gadfly notes, these delays are material, particularly for a company burning through as much cash as it is.

Cold weather sweeps U.S.; natural gas prices surge 60x. The deep freeze hitting much of the eastern half of the U.S. has provided a jolt to demand for energy of all types. Regional natural gas prices have spiked, particularly in the New England. While Nymex futures remain subdued, spot prices in New York briefly surged to $175/MMBtu. Higher gas prices have made coal temporarily more competitive. And in some areas, even diesel is in higher demand. That has altered trade flows, with diesel shipments that tend to go from the U.S. to Europe heading in the other direction. JBC Energy predicts that U.S. diesel demand will be 90,000 bpd higher in January and February than a year earlier. Meanwhile, at least five refineries along the East Coast reported outages because of frozen equipment, although there hasn't yet been any significant hit to production.

OPEC production steady in December. OPEC produced 32.47 mb/d in December, according to a Bloomberg News estimate, essentially flat from a month earlier. Some notable declines came from Libya (pipeline outage), Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, while Nigeria boosted output. OPEC's compliance rate for December stood at 121 percent, the same as November.

China to overtake Japan as world's largest natural gas importer. As China continues to swap out coal for natural gas, its demand for gas is rising sharply. That likely means that China will claim the mantle of the world's largest importer of natural gas this year, surpassing Japan. Japan will still be the largest importer of LNG, but China's combined imports of LNG and pipeline gas will make it the world's largest importer. China is already the largest importer of coal and oil, but gas is increasingly central to the country's energy plans.

New reports suggest waivers are in the offing. ""Oil prices look to remain under pressure, as fears of global oversupply have returned with a vengeance,"" Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, told Reuters.

U.S. to grant waivers to eight countries importing Iranian oil. The U.S. has granted exemptions to eight importers of Iranian oil just days before sanctions on Iran take effect. The countries will be allowed to continue to import oil without fear of retribution from the U.S. as long as they continue to make reductions in those purchases, according to Bloomberg. Four of the countries include Iran's top buyers - China, India, South Korea and Japan. The other four were not identified in the Bloomberg report, but the decision is expected to be announced on Monday.

U.S. oil production surges. The EIA said the U.S. produced more than 11.3 mb/d in August, a massive jump of over 400,000 bpd from a month earlier. The new record high also made the U.S. the largest oil producer in the world. Record output, combined with higher production from OPEC, has dealt sharp losses to crude oil prices amid mounting fears of oversupply.

The two leaders are expected to meet later this month at the G20 summit in Argentina, and the conversation by phone this week raises the odds of a breakthrough on trade. Crucially, Bloomberg reports that Trump wants to reach a deal with Xi in Argentina, and he reportedly asked his cabinet to draft terms. However, hours after the phone call, the U.S. Justice Department unveiled charges against two Chinese companies for intellectual property theft, illustrating the difficult task of resolving differences between the two countries.

U.S. seeks to keep Middle East oil flowing. U.S. diplomats have reportedly stepped in to try to resolve disputes in the Middle East to increase oil flows. According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. is trying to broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over the Neutral Zone oil fields, which have 500,000 bpd of capacity but have been offline for years. The U.S. is also trying to help Iraq export more oil through Kurdistan, which would add another 300,000 bpd or so to global supplies. Washington is trying to ease these burdens at a time when it is seeking to shut in Iranian production.

EOG posts $1.2 billion in profit. EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) posted an enormous $1.2 billion in third quarter profit, up more than ten-fold from the $100 million profit a year earlier. The performance is a strong vote of confidence in shale drilling, after years of red ink across the industry.

Continental Resources doubles resource estimate. Continental Resources (NYSE: CLR) doubled its estimated recoverable resources to 30-40 billion barrels, up from the previous estimate of 20 billion barrels set in 2011. ""With today's completion technology we are recovering 15% and potentially 20% of the oil in place on a primary basis,"" Continental's President Jack Stark said during today's earnings conference call. ""This is substantially higher than the recoveries that we thought possible back in 2011.""

Tanker rates up on higher OPEC production. Tanker rates are rising as OPEC ships more oil, pushing day-rates up to $51,000, up nearly three-fold from the $18,000 rates seen just a month ago.

Oil and gas sector needs consolidation. Top industry executives said that the oil and gas industry needs to consolidate, in order to reach scale, cut costs and streamline services. ""There's a lot of smaller high-quality companies across industry where synergy and value can be captured"" by combining, Chesapeake Energy's (NYSE: CHK) CEO Doug Lawler said at the Deloitte Oil & Gas Conference, according to S&P Global Platts. ""This will be a part of [Chesapeake's] strategy going forward."" Other top analysts and executives voiced similar sentiments, an indication that a new wave of M&A activity could be coming.

Petrobras could divest $20 billion. New Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has indicated he would not privatize Petrobras for now, but the company might still divest itself of some $20 billion worth of assets, according to a source for Reuters.

Economists: Brent to average $76 in 2019. A Reuters survey of 46 economists find an averaged predicted Brent crude price of $76.88 per barrel in 2019. The respondents see Iran sanctions putting a floor beneath oil prices, but weaker demand and a slower global economy putting a cap on prices.

OPEC production hits two-year high. OPEC production rose in October to its highest level in nearly two years. Higher output from Saudi Arabia, Libya and the UAE pushed production up 390,000 bpd compared to September's levels. The figures gave the market confidence OPEC will be able to supply the market as Iranian production goes offline.

Oil majors post huge earnings. The third quarter earnings for the oil majors were the strongest in years, with a significant jump in profits. Cost-cutting and higher oil prices led to a windfall for the world's largest oil companies. Most of them are sticking with a plan of capital discipline, with an emphasis on boosting shareholder returns.

Venezuela's refinery utilization plummets, leading to fuel shortages. Venezuela's refineries are operating at low levels as the nation runs short on crude oil.

11402809,2018-10-03,"Marathon Oil launched this week the sale of its oil and gas assets in the UK North Sea, Reuters reported on Wednesday, quoting a sales document it had seen, in what could become the latest U.S. oil firm seeking to exit the North Sea to focus on the American shale plays.

Marathon Oil is selling its minority stakes in the Foinaven fields in the west of Shetland area operated by BP and interests in the Brae complex northeast of Aberdeen in a sales process run by Jefferies. Bids are expected by December this year, according to the document that Reuters has seen.

According to banking sources, Marathon Oil's assets in the UK North Sea could fetch up to US$200 million.

Marathon Oil holds interests in the Foinaven fields, in the SAGE pipeline, and continues the planning for the decommissioning of the Brae Area facilities in the UK sector of the central North Sea.

Marathon Oil's assets in the North Sea produce a total of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and the resource base is of 31 million barrels. The assets are expected to yield US$85 million in cash flow next year, according to the sales document that Reuters has seen.

Although the assets and the price tag are not exceptionally significant, the potential pullout of Marathon Oil from the UK North Sea would fit in the company's strategy to focus on its high-value high-margin U.S. shale assets.

""Portfolio management is an ongoing and integral element of our successful business model as we continue to simplify and concentrate our portfolio to our highest return opportunities with a focus on our differentiated position in the U.S. resource plays,"" Marathon Oil's spokeswoman Lee Warren told Reuters, declining to comment directly on the sale process.

In March this year, Marathon Oil sold its 16.33 percent non-operated interest in the Waha concessions in Libya to France's Total for US$450 million, with which the U.S. company exited Libya.

""Today's announcement to divest Libya at an attractive valuation continues the simplification and concentration of our portfolio to the high margin, high return U.S. resource plays,"" Lee Tillman, Marathon Oil president and CEO, said in March.

11402810,2018-09-24,"The OPEC/ non-OPEC JMCC meeting in Algiers has provided a very diffuse outcome.

Oil markets seem to be heading to a state of instability, as oil supplies come under severe pressure in the coming months. The world's leading oil cartel seems also to be under pressure, as internal conflicts and possible in-depth cooperation with Russia could lead to a restructuring of the old giant.

The outcome of the JMCC meeting between OPEC and Russia has produced a diffuse result. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading oil producer, and Russia seem to have rebuked U.S. president Donald Trump's request to increase overall oil production to counter higher oil prices.

In a direct remark, Saudi's minister of energy Khalid Al Falih stated that OPEC is not interested to increase prices as was stated by Trump. The U.S. president even had warned to take action if the oil cartel continued with its so-called strategy to squeeze the market to gain higher revenues. The Algiers answer was clear, production won't be increased, except if the market shows a severe tightening. The cartel seems to be taking a very interesting position, as this means that OPEC and Russia will decide when to act and how to act.

At present, OPEC sees not yet a real need to supply additional volumes at all, as stocks are still above the 5 year average. Russia and Saudi Arabia repeated their claims that if needed they will be able to supply the additional volumes, as spare capacity is still available. These statements have been made on a regular basis the last months, especially after Trump revoked the JCPOA deal with Iran, which will significantly reduce Iranian oil exports the coming months. Analysts are keeping a close eye on the situation, as a severe tightening in the market could become a major problem after November this year, when U.S. sanctions will be fully implemented on Iran and all of its customers.

Oil traders still seem not to have reached a consensus on the future situation. Optimism in Europe is bluntly contrasted by statements made by traders such as Mercuria and Trafigura, who have warned already that oil prices could spike to around $100 per barrel. $100 oil is not even a real doomsday scenario, as global outages and possible conflicts could easily push prices up further.

Not all signals, however, are bullish for oil. The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, which could lead to a lower demand growth the coming months, could soften the pain and result in stabilizing oil prices due to lower demand growth. At the same time, several emerging markets seem to be heading towards a possible economic crisis scenario. Turkey, Egypt and others, are facing headwinds, while higher oil prices in combination with higher dollar exchange rates in markets such as India also are putting pressure on demand.

The Algiers meeting however has shown that the oil cartel is heading towards a potential existential crisis. The already well documented crisis between leading OPEC members Saudi Arabia-UAE and Iran is escalating. The fact that Iran was not even attending the meeting showed that Tehran is not amused at all about the ongoing efforts of Saudi Arabia and Russia to fill in the gaps in supply expected the coming months. Tehran has repeatedly warned both not to take advantage of the dire situation that Iran is facing the coming months. Moscow and Riyadh were quick to say that any supply crunch will be met by others accordingly.

Other OPEC leaders have also stepped up their efforts to further formalize the ongoing cooperation with non-OPEC countries, especially Russia, for the future. Even that no real legal document has been produced yet to formalize a NOPEC approach, most market analysts are expecting that at or even before the next OPEC meeting in Vienna discussions will be held to put a new framework in place. If this is being put on the table, OPEC's current position will be changed. Iran, and possibly other hard-liners such as Venezuela, will not be amused as the new oil cartel will be seen as a direct attack on the position of these OPEC members. In a possible new strategic alliance or even formal oil cartel (NOPEC), the power of Iran and others will be under pressure. A possible real split within OPEC is a real possibility, as Tehran will never be willing to become a minor partner in a new NOPEC organization. Moscow and Riyadh, supported by the UAE and others, however seem not to be willing to take notice of any Iranian concerns at present. Geopolitical considerations, supported by a possible revenue windfall due to higher oil prices, are leading Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman's efforts to squeeze Iran to the fullest. Trump's tweets and Tehran's threats are currently brushed aside.

For oil consumers, the coming months will be a rollercoaster ride not seen since the start of the financial crisis. A possible price hike, combined with economic uncertainty worldwide, will increase price volatility severely.

The potential risk of an oil price bump is high, but oil producers currently are smelling blood. Continuing economic growth, even slightly tempered by the U.S.-China trade war and instability in emerging markets, is still strong enough to push demand above 100 million bpd in 2018. Further global demand growth is expected, while supply growth is starting to slow down.

OPEC's stated spare production capacity has not materialized at all yet as a factor in the market. Saudi Arabia's presumed spare capacity is under severe pressure, as the Kingdom still needs to show to be able to sustainably produce 12.5 million bpd. Recently, producers such as Iraq, Libya and Russia, have published very positive preliminary production volumes, but no real volumes have been reported on the market. Historically, optimistic production figures emerge always around OPEC meetings, but facts have most of the time shown a different reality. OPEC at the same time reported that US$11 trillion in new investments are needed until 2040 to keep production levels up. The last years, investments in upstream and downstream have been lagging behind, and there are no clear signals that this will change anytime soon. Some relief can be expected from U.S. shale, at least according to OPEC and the U.S. This, however, will only be the case if investors show an appetite for upstream projects. The current reality is different, fear about a carbon bubble and the anti-hydrocarbon lobby already support a negative spiral of investor confidence.

OPEC and Russia will NOT be able to meet all new demand in the coming years, and international oil companies and independents will have to fill the gap. If they fail to do so, US$100 oil could become a reality faster than many governments and consumers expected.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Algiers', 'United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'Iran', 'Tehran', 'Moscow', 'Riyadh', 'Turkey', 'India', 'Egypt', 'China', 'Vienna', 'Venezuela', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Iraq', 'Libya']",OPEC Meeting Sets Oil Markets Up For A Price Spike | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/OPEC-Meeting-Sets-Oil-Markets-Up-For-A-Price-Spike.html,None,

Global financial turmoil. Stocks fell yet again on Thursday, following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates and maintain a rate tightening course in 2019. The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell by 1.4 percent on Friday, and the index is set to enter a bear market after falling 20 percent from its November 2017 peak. The global financial upheaval, which could presage a growing economic slowdown, presents a major threat to oil prices.

U.S. government shutdown. At the time of this writing, the U.S. was hurtling towards a government shutdown over budget disagreements, with a midnight deadline Friday. An agreement is still possible, but the potential shutdown was seen as another contributor to financial turmoil this week.

Saudi Arabia increases production cuts. Saudi Arabia could increase the size of its production cut after watching oil prices spiral downwards. According to the Wall Street Journal, Saudi Arabia will cut by 322,000 bpd from October levels, rather than 250,000 bpd. That would limit output to 10.311 mb/d for six months. The report offers a mixed message, however, since Saudi Arabia has already signaled that it could lower output to 10.2 mb/d in January.

OPEC+ to release country quotas. OPEC+ is set to release country-specific production quotas, recognizing that the lack of detail in Vienna earlier this month has hurt its efforts to convince the market. ""In the interests of openness and transparency, and to support market sentiment and confidence, it is vital to make these production adjustments publicly available,"" OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told OPEC members in a letter.

Trump admin cuts deal with Iraq. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration has granted Iraq a waiver extension, allowing it to continue to import natural gas from Iran for another three months. In return, Iraq has seemingly pledged to allow American energy companies greater access in the country, including GE (NYSE: GE) and Orion Gas Processors LLC for power generation, and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) for oil production.

OPEC members suffering from low oil prices. With Brent in the mid-$50s, the budgets for OPEC members will come under strain, and perhaps only Kuwait can see its budget breakeven. Low prices could sow unrest in several OPEC member states. ""At current prices, too much attention on shale, not enough on OPEC,"" Olivier Jakob, managing director at Swiss consultant Petromatrix GmbH, told Bloomberg. Libya and Algeria, for instance, need oil prices above $100 per barrel. Even Saudi Arabia needs oil north of $80 per barrel for its budget to breakeven.

North Sea oil emerges from downturn. Many obituaries were written for the North Sea during the 2014-2016 oil market downturn, but the region is starting to see a bit of rebound. A series of M&A deals this year have led to an injection of new investment. There are still formidable hurdles in the medium- and long-term, but S&P Global Platts reports on signs of hope for the aging oil basin.

China avoids U.S. oil. China is still holding off on buying much American oil, despite the three-month trade truce between the two countries. ""Chinese companies have little incentive to buy U.S. crude due to the wide availability of crude supplies today from Iran and Russia,"" Seng Yick Tee, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, told Reuters. ""Even though the trade tension between China and the U.S. had been defused recently, the executives from the national oil companies hesitate to procure U.S. crude unless they are told to do so.""

ExxonMobil shelves Canada LNG project. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) has scrapped its plan for its WCC LNG export terminal in Canada. The move comes shortly after Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) gave the greenlight for its massive LNG export project on Canada's coast. Exxon's project was further behind, and the oil major is instead focusing on a handful of LNG projects in Papua New Guinea, East Africa and with Qatar.

Poland signs 20-year LNG deal with U.S. company. Poland's state-owned natural gas company inked a 20-year agreement to import LNG from the U.S., a business decision that also affects geopolitics in Europe. Polish Oil & Gas Company, or PGNiG, signed a deal with Sempra Energy's (NYSE: SRE) Port Arthur LNG facility, importing 2 million metric tons of LNG per year. The project has not received an FID yet, but the agreement with Poland could move it forward. The U.S. government has long pushed LNG exports as a vehicle to pry away Eastern Europe from dependence on Russia.

U.S. southwest explores gas pipeline. The governors of Arizona, New Mexico and Mexico's state of Sonora signed an agreement on Wednesday to explore a potential natural gas pipeline to move Permian gas to the Gulf of California. The non-binding agreement encourages the states to explore and promote investment for a pipeline and possible LNG export terminal in the Gulf. ""Asia's burgeoning demand, New Mexico's abundant supply, and Arizona and Sonora's strategic location and transport networks all combine to present an opportunity for continued regional growth,"" the agreement says.

Colorado drillers could see stiffer regulation. Democrats tightened their grip in Colorado in the mid-term elections, which could usher in a period of stricter regulation on oil and gas. Even though voters rejected a public referendum on greater setback distances for shale drilling, the legislature could aim for greater local control, handing towns and cities the ability to put restrictions on drilling. Just this week, the state's regulator expanded setback distances near school properties to include playgrounds and not just the school buildings, a modest change, but one that foreshadows other restrictions.

11402829,2018-12-20,"Libya's largest oil field Sharara will reopen after Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj negotiated with the protesters that had blockaded it and agreed to meet their demands, Libyan media report. However, the National Oil Corporation has not confirmed it will restart the field.

Some media identified the protesters as members of a movement called Fezzan Rage, although initial reports of the blockade also named the Petroleum Facilities Guard as also taking part in the outage, as per the National Oil Corporation. The most recent reports also mention figures from the Petroleum Facilities Guard as taking part in the blockade.

The Prime Minister of the internationally recognized Libyan government acknowledged the demands of the protesters but said they could not be enforced on the government through threats and the disruption of Libya's oil production.

The Sharara field has been shut down for almost two weeks now, after a group of local tribesmen and militants from the Petroleum Facilities Guard took control of it and demanded what NOC called a ransom for lifting the blockade. The state oil company warned against paying, noting this would set a dangerous precedent. In fact, the company's chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, went as far as to say NOC will not restart production at Sharara if the government pays the PFG.

NOC declared a force majeure on the field last Sunday, which affected not just Sharara itself but also neighboring El Feel field, which gets its power from the larger field. Sharara supplies some 315,000 bpd to Libya's total production, which had rebounded above 1 million barrels daily shortly before the blockade.

Now, Serraj has agreed to set up a fund of over US$700 million for the development of southern Libya, a part of the country that has been neglected for a long time. Also, a PFG commander demanded on local TV that the prime Minister must also supply the guard with means to secure the field although he did not elaborate on the nature of these means.

The blockade earlier this week forced the National Oil Corporation to declare force majeure on the field, which produces around 315,000 bpd. In its statement, NOC said that production from the field will resume when ""alternative security arrangements are put in place."" This force majeure follows another one from last week that covered exports from the blocked field that contributes almost a third of Libya's national total.

""The United States continues to monitor the situation at the Sharara oil field and echoes the UN Support Mission for Libya's call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of armed elements in the area, which is crucial to allow oil production for the benefit of all Libyans to resume,"" the State Department statement read.

OPEC's rollercoaster ride in Vienna highlights the growing divide within the oil cartel. Many oil analysts and financial gurus have fallen for the oldest media trick in the world, and a growing rift in the organization shows a new era is coming.

The so-called unexpected production cut, which was presented by OPEC's media genius and Saudi Minister of Energy Khalid Al Falih, was not enough to curtail the current uncertainty in oil markets. After first indicating only a 800,000-1 million bpd production cut, which crashed prices straight away, Al Falih, in cooperation with his Russian colleague Novak, surprised the market 24 hours later by reporting a 1.2 million bpd production cut agreement. The reaction of the market, and all its specialists, was predictable. Crude oil prices jumped, reflecting a belief that stability had returned. Without even knowing the real facts of the agreement, oil market sentiment became immediately bullish. According to the statement by OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, the production cut will be based on October 2018 production levels, including some vague commitments of non-OPEC countries. Bullish sentiment seems to have returned, but several key factors remain unclear.

Taking a step back from oil market sentiment and OPEC's media strategies, two real crisis scenarios are already emerging. The first one is a real market fundamentals related one. Looking at the ongoing oil production surge of OPEC countries such as Iraq, and non-OPEC countries, especially U.S. shale but also Brazil, the perceived oil glut still exists. No action has been taken that would suggest OPEC and Russia are able to counter these developments in full force. The picture becomes even more gloomy if the ongoing U.S.-China trade war heats up, and European and Asian economic growth is lower than expected. The impact of a hard Brexit, which seems more likely following the recent political meltdown in the UK, will also cause a negative economic ripple. These macro-economic factors are changing the demand picture in 2019, and could even lead to a rise in crude oil inventories in the next months.

NOPEC's only solution at present, if the cartel really wanted to change the market and re-establish its dominance, would have been a production cut agreement to the tone of 1.4-1.8 million bpd on the basis of October 2018 output. Some additional analysis shows that September-October 2018 production was already too high as most capable producers, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, increased their production substantially before the meeting. Other OPEC producers, especially Iraq and Libya, came back to the market at the same time. All these factors grossly outweighed the expected impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran. It seems that OPEC's December 2018 decision has not done enough to counter the vast range of known threats in 2019.

At the same time, OPEC's internal cohesion appears to be vanishing. Since 2017, the cartel has shown that it needs to reassess its internal strategy. The last OPEC meeting in Vienna, which was largely focused on the possible negative effects of U.S. sanctions on Iran, already demonstrated a deep and growing rift between the leading parties inside of the cartel.

The former hardline coalition of Iran, Venezuela and some minors, has been marginalized. Internal Arab regional conflicts have also taken their toll, which became painfully clear at the last meeting meeting when Qatari officials were mostly shunned by their Arab counterparts. The decision of Qatar to leave the oil cartel is not in any way linked to a new LNG/gas strategy of the peninsular state, but totally linked to its continued poor relation with Saudi Arabia, UAE, and some of the other Arab associates. Some even argue that Qatar's decision has increased for a very short moment the internal cohesion of the cartel, but on the mid- to long-term the move will likely result in a further rift within the cartel. With Qatar out of the OPEC equation by January 2019, Iran feeling the real effects of U.S. sanctions and Venezuela's political and economic situation deteriorating, a new reality will emerge. OPEC is no longer a coalition of the willing, in which large and smaller oil producers are combining their forces to reap the highest rewards possible.

OPEC in December 2018 has become a Gulf Arab OPEC, made up of two main leaders, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, while Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and even Algeria and Libya, are following the pack. Iraq is at present but in the twilight zone, trying to find its position between the Arab Coalition of Saudi Arabia, and its historical and religious compatriot Iran. OPEC is changing, the new road signs have been planted, and while surveyors are putting some of the stakes in the ground, it is likely that the next couple of months will see Saudi Arabia and the UAE set up a strategy to reform OPEC. The new cartel is most likely to become an Arab led coalition which would aim to get Russia and maybe some Central Asian parties on board. Backed by Libya, Algeria and the smaller Gulf Arab states, the Saudi-UAE-Russia Triumvirate will also marginalize possible opposition of other Arab and Latin American OPEC members. The position of Nigeria, still supporting Saudi Arabia, and Angola will be crucial. A new NOPEC structure will put pressure on their respective influence inside of the cartel. Latin American producers, such as Venezuela or Ecuador, currently have very little influence.

In the next few months OPEC's future will be decided. Looking at the current situation, a new strategy is needed, in which Russia plays a crucial role. Without the support of Moscow, OPEC will struggle to keep its position. Khalid Al Falih's strategic insights and knowledge will be challenged by this new situation. Without Moscow, there can be no stability in the market. On that front, deteriorating relations between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the West can only be good for Saudi-Russo relations. Vladimir Putin's High Five with MBS at the G20 summit could very well become the World Press Photo for 2019. The growing friendship and a stronger economic and military alliance between the Arab Gulf States and Moscow is clear, and NOPEC could be the first real sign of a new geopolitical reality.

Most oil ministers continue to claim that OPEC is not a geopolitical alliance, but the reality is clear. Oil and geopolitics are intimately connected and OPEC and Russia are the new global oil power brokers. We don't know the exact form NOPEC will take, but 2019 could be the start of a new era, in which the West and Asia will need to readjust to a new geopolitical force.

Until then, we are going to see a lot of volatility in the oil market - as testified by last week's oil price rollercoaster. On Monday, oil took a 6 percent plunge as fears of an impending supply glut grew. Now, just several weeks after Saudi Arabia and Russia ramped up production to compensate for the loss of Iranian volumes, it seems the two will be forced to curb their appetites.

The United States, however, is pumping more and more into the market, unrestricted by the OPEC+ agreement or any other commitment. Luckily for producers, oil prices rebounded on Tuesday-Wednesday thanks to the API reporting the first drawdown in US commercial crude stocks in 9 weeks (falling by 1.5 MMBbl week-on-week).

Not only is there a long line of U.S. Senators calling for an in-depth investigation of the matter, some have even openly called for the removal of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin. Senior R-Senator Lindsay Graham, one of the staunchest supporters of US president Trump and Saudi Arabia, has broken ranks as he asked on US Fox-News to remove MBS from his position.

These moves from Washington are not only endangering the very strong ties between Washington and Riyadh, but also endanger the overall Middle East and internal stability of OPEC. The oil cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, is looking at a very stormy ride the next couple of months, while the U.S. is heading for another showdown in the Arab world.

The Khashoggi case has become a possible watershed in international relations. Statements made by US R-Senator Graham, already supported by other high-ranking U.S. officials, show that the position of Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally of Washington in the Middle East, and MBS in particular, is under severe pressure.

The public threat, made by Graham news channel Fox-News, to put strong sanctions on Saudi Arabia, if the Crown Prince is not being removed, is a first. Not even in the case of Iran, Russia's involvement in the Ukraine or the ongoing disaster in Syria, an open call was made for regime change. If threats were made by U.S. government-linked senators, it always was directly linked to a strong opposition movement in that country, or being directed at an anti-U.S. government or entity.

This time, the threat has been directed at a, until 2 weeks ago, strongly supported ally, with strong ties to Washington policymakers, the financial world and the defense industry. U..S. president Trump's current statements on Saudi Arabia, the moves made by U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo and others, now seem to be very hollow. The Washington Administration looks like a lame duck, as its supporters in Congress and the NY financial world are calling for a strong and anti-Saudi reaction. Such as reactions, however, could have a more negative impact for the U.S. and Western interests than currently is being discussed.

The Khashoggi crisis comes at a pivotal moment in the energy markets and geopolitical arena. While the West tries to revamp its influence in the Middle East, they are being confronted by the re-emergence of Russian power and influence of China. At the same time, Washington is set to implement sanctions on Iran, possibly shaking global energy markets to its foundations. Strong support is needed from the Arab states. Washington's approach is very diffuse, as it also threatens legal action against OPEC. The so-called 'No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act ""or ""NOPEC"" legislation is threatening anti-trust lawsuits against the oil cartel. According to Reuters, OPEC has already stated to its members not to discuss oil price hikes, as it could result in legal action or another Washington - Riyadh clash. ""We solemnly believe that market stability, and not prices, is the common objective of our actions,"" UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui, who holds the rotating OPEC presidency this year, wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters. In the same letter, Mazroui reiterated that ""to refrain from any reference to prices in their commentary about our collective efforts or oil market condition"".

Ongoing pressure in Washington to put the law up for voting has caused bad blood in several OPEC capitals. Trump's repeated calls on OPEC to increase production to lower prices also has not been taken lightly. The Khashoggi case could increase support in Washington to back the NOPEC bill. Saudi Arabia is extremely worried about the bill. ""There is a major fear NOPEC could turn into another JASTA,"" one of the sources familiar with Aramco IPO preparations said, referring to the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act which allows victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Riyadh. At present, $1 trillion in Saudi investments in the U.S. could be at stake. If the NOPEC bill is signed into law, the move would revoke the sovereign immunity from U.S. legal action which oil producers, including OPEC members, currently enjoy.

In addition to U.S. interests in the region, Europe is being confronted by growing Russian and Chinese involvement in the Arab world, threatening in theory its economic and military interests too. Washington's strong hand policies on Saudi Arabia could lead to a weakening of overall Western interests in the coming weeks. A call for the removal of MBS in Saudi Arabia is for sure going to be seen in the other Arab capitals as new Western (colonialist) betrayal of its friends in the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt. Western influence already has diminished after their support for change in Libya and Egypt. The current Western moves are seen by most in this light.

A possible shift in geopolitical alliances is imminent. The pressure from the West will entice or even force Saudi Arabia, and its allies, to reassess their future. As indicated before, Saudi Arabia has already opened up its doors to Russia. These ties were forged by a slump in oil prices and the need to strengthen the hold of the Kingdom and OPEC on the oil market. The success of the OPEC/Russia cooperation has become clear, but also has led to a discussion on security and investments. The historical orientation of the Arab world, especially Saudi Arabia, but also the UAE and Egypt, on the West has changed already dramatically, but will now take a giant leap further.

Economically Asia has taken over already, as immense investments made by oil companies such as Aramco and ADNOC in China, India and other Asian emerging markets show. Russia has taken its share too. Moscow's real strength, however, next to oil-gas markets, is it willingness to back up its friends in time of need. A military alliance is on the table, looking at the current developments. The security of the Arab regimes is at stake, so choices will have to be made. A full-stop cooperation between Riyadh and Moscow, based on OPEC oil issues and security developments, is to be expected in the next months. The first signs will be seen in Riyadh next week at the FII2018.

For the global oil markets this will be a game-changer. If Arab regimes need to get security and political support from Moscow, and Beijing, Western energy interests are at stake. A possible anti-cartel law as proposed in the U.S. will only add to this. The year 2018 could become the year of a new geopolitical oil market reality. Full cooperation between OPEC leader Saudi Arabia, supported by the UAE, and Russia will present Washington and Brussels with a new global energy market situation which they won't be able to mitigate anymore.

Washington's strive to change the oil market, which already was a fata morgana, could be ended before the first green sprout is showing. With the current antagonistic position taken by Washington's elite, a clash is imminent with Saudi Arabia and others. The main OPEC leaders will keep to their current production strategy, not willing to open up their taps. A possible stronger move to keep volumes lower than expected is also in the offing, as Saudi Arabia is not forced to produce at current levels at all. A strong reaction is to be expected soon.

In addition to a smiling Putin, who is going to be the main beneficiary of the current crisis, the mullahs in Tehran will be enjoying their free lunch too. Without support of Saudi Arabia and others, U.S. sanctions on Iran could be an empty threat. Trump can forget full support from Saudi Arabia/MBS as long as the latter is under pressure. Iran could be one of the beneficiaries of the current clash. The regional power struggle between Riyadh and Tehran could be put aside when looking at a pure OPEC strategy. Consolidation of the current production agreement, without Saudi Arabia and Russia filling the void of Iran's oil volumes, could be an outcome to be expected.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Washington (state)', 'Riyadh', 'United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Russia', 'China', 'Ukraine', 'Syria', 'Iran', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Moscow', 'Beijing', 'Libya', 'India', 'Bahrain']",U.S-Saudi Clash Could Spell Disaster For OPEC | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Saudi-Clash-Could-Spell-Disaster-For-OPEC.html,None,
11402834,2018-06-23,"No fewer than Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Turkish Cypriot President Mustafa Akinci attended a gathering in Central Turkey on 12 June. The amount and variety of attendees of this meeting reveal a common interest in one field of geopolitical developments: energy and more specifically natural gas.

The opening ceremony of the 1.850 kilometers long Trans Anatolian Pipeline, TANAP, starting at the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan and ending in Turkey, is the last step before connecting to the European grid in Greece and Italy. TANAP is part of the Southern Gas Corridor, which was the dream of many European leaders and officials to create an alternative to Russian gas.

The attendance of several high-level dignitaries shows the interest in the pipeline and the geopolitical developments of the region. More specifically, Russia's dominant position in the natural gas market of southeast Europe has set leaders scrambling to find alternatives or at least competition of producers.

The fraught relations between Russia and Ukraine brought these countries on a collision course. However, due to historical reasons the energy industries of Moscow and Kiev have been closely intertwined. Russia has set itself an ambitious goal of circumventing Ukraine as its main transit country for gas exports. The Turk Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, which are either planned or under construction, will carry much of the needed gas to Europe starting in 2019 when a new transit contract has to be signed with Kiev.

Ukraine intends to diversify away from and ultimately stop buying gas from Russia. The Southern Gas Corridor, therefore, is a highly anticipated alternative. The attending of Petro Poroshenko at the opening ceremony is a testament to this goal. Already Ukraine importing gas from neighbouring European countries with plans to increase domestic production of natural gas.

The election of a new government in Italy has brought change to the strategic energy map, which for a decade seemed to be fixed. The 40 billion Southern Gas Corridor pipeline bringing Azeri gas to Europe was intended to be linked to Italy's by a yet-to-be-built Trans Adriatic Pipeline, TAP. However, the coalition government of the Five Star Movement and the League has created much uncertainty.

Environment Minister Sergio Costa has dubbed TAP as ""pointless"" and has ordered the launch of a formal review. The coalition partners have made fighting corruption one of their election promises. Furthermore, decreasing gas consumption is used as another argument not to construct an additional pipeline. Although demand has risen over the years, it is nowhere near the peak of a decade ago. Italy imports 90 percent of its needs from Russia, Libya, Algeria, and Holland while there is spare capacity.

Environmental reasons are also being used as the 5-Star Movement has a green political program. The new government's minister for southern Italy, Barbara Lezzi, has said that the government believes that the pipeline presented an unnecessary environmental danger given Italy's excess gas capacity. Although Puglia's governor does not object to the construction of TAP, he has proposed redirecting it away from a tourist area.

The TAP consortium, which includes British oil group BP, Italy's Snam and Spain's Enagas, has said re-routing the pipeline away from Italy is not an option. Also, redirecting it inside Italy could delay the project by four to five years. However, analysts have predicted that there is an alternative: existing gas transit lines through the Balkans could be repurposed, and additional interconnectors could facilitate the transport of gas to Southeastern and Eastern Europe.

However, for now, this seems not as a reasonable alternative as it could take years of planning, securing new financing, and receiving political support in a fragmented region with diverging interests. What looked like a streamlined project (Southern Gas Corridor) with political and financial support both from Brussels and local players, has the potential of becoming a crisis. The European strategic energy map has been plunged into uncertainty due to recent developments as several major pipelines are planned, under construction or face uncertain futures.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Ukraine', 'Turkey', 'Russia', 'Italy', 'Kiev', 'Serbia', 'Moscow', 'Greece', 'Azerbaijan', 'Apulia', 'Netherlands', 'Libya', 'United Kingdom', 'Spain', 'Algeria', 'Brussels']",A Storm Is Brewing In The Southern Gas Corridor | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Africa/A-Storm-Is-Brewing-In-The-Southern-Gas-Corridor.html,None,
11402835,2018-06-20,"Irina is a writer for the U.S.-based Divergente LLC consulting firm with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry.

Back in 2011, when OPEC met to discuss raising oil production to offset the drop in Libya, resulting from the civil war, Saudi Arabia's Ali al-Naimi called it ""one of the worst meetings ever."" That meeting ended without consensus and this is likely to happen again this week, when the cartel meets to discuss another production increase.

The fault line is between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which have both signaled that they are all for a substantial increase in production, of up to 1.5 million bpd, and Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Algeria (to date), which would have a problem raising their production.

The latest remarks from Iran's Oil Minister are not really encouraging. Bijan Zanganeh said, as quoted by Reuters, that ""I don't believe at this meeting we can reach agreement. OPEC is not the organization to receive instruction from President Trump ... OPEC is not part of the Department of Energy of the United States.""

The comment refers to President Trump's tweets about OPEC artificially pushing prices higher and reports that he personally asked Saudi Arabia's government to step in and replace soon-to-be-lost Iranian barrels with its own after sanctions kick in.

Zanganeh also said he will be leaving Vienna before OPEC's meeting with Russia and the other non-member partners in the cut deal. Russia is Iran's geopolitical ally, but now they are in opposing camps with regard to oil production moves and missing that particular meeting could be a diplomatic move to avoid confrontation.

Russia is the country pushing for the highest increase, of 1.5 million bpd. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said ""Oil demand usually grows at the steepest pace in the third quarter ... We could face a deficit if we don't take measures,"" echoing widely shared analyst expectations of booming oil demand that they have argued was instrumental in the oil price improvement over the last year or so.

Instrumental as it has been, it is not as robust and unyielding as previously believed. When prices climbed closer to US$80 a barrel, demand growth began to slow down, which for some reason surprised many oil bulls.

This slowdown in demand growth highlighted the fact that the emerging economies that are the biggest drivers behind global oil demand growth are not ready to pay whatever asking price they are offered. They are rather going to bargain for lower prices, which is exactly what India and China did, prompting OPEC to consider an early end to the cuts.

As for the internal fractures within OPEC, it's also worth noting that two of Saudi Arabia's Gulf allies -- Kuwait and Oman -- are also not on board with a quick, major production boost. They seem to be leaning more towards a gradual, and more modest, increase, Reuters reports citing OPEC sources. Indeed, some believe Russia's 1.5-million-bpd proposal is a tactical move aimed at priming the dissenters for agreement to a more modest increase.

Whether or not this move succeeds -- the chance seems to be fifty-fifty right now -- OPEC might soon have a bigger problem to deal with. The U.S. Congress is deliberating the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, which -- if passed -- would allow lawsuits against OPEC members for manipulating the market.

11402836,2018-06-03,"In a tight oil market reacting with price gains to concerns about supply shortages, the leaders of the OPEC and non-OPEC nations part of the production cut deal -- Saudi Arabia and Russia -- hinted last week that easing the cuts was an option that they had discussed and that would be up for talks at the OPEC and allies' meeting in less than a month.

Oil prices plunged from three-and-a-half-year highs on reports that the Saudis and Russia may add as much as 1 million bpd of supply to offset crumbling Venezuelan production and possible loss of Iranian oil exports with the return of the U.S. sanctions.

Many analysts don't think the group would add the reported 1 million bpd of supply, but the oil market lapped up the news and concerns about a return to oversupply have dominated the OPEC chatter news flow for nearly a week. As the June 22 meeting is drawing closer, oil prices will likely react to any new hint, comment, or report about OPEC's efforts to ""address consumer anxiety over security of oil supplies.""

The latest of those reports says that OPEC and non-OPEC are set to stick to the production cuts through the end of 2018, but will be ready to ""adjust"" supply to address possible shortages.

The group of producers part of the pact ""is not ready yet to fully lift controls,"" a Gulf source familiar with the Saudi thinking has told Reuters, adding that ""it is going to be a long-term cooperation for the sake of a stable oil market.""

""However, if any shortage takes place, the producers will coordinate closely and promptly take necessary actions. The OPEC and non-OPEC agreement will remain in place. But the level of the cut may be adjusted if a physical shortage arises,"" the source told Reuters.

""I can't see them putting a million barrels on the market,"" Helima Croft, RBC Capital Markets Managing Director and Global Head of Commodity Strategy, told CNBC earlier this week.

The Saudis have to ""walk a fine line"" between their own revenue needs and helping consumer nations out, and helping the Trump Administration out, according to Croft.

The Saudis may also have to quash discontent and dissent within OPEC over the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia hadn't briefed in advance most of the other nations on their 'easing cuts' discussions, although both Russia and the Saudis, as well as OPEC's current president the UAE, affirmed that any decision would be made ""collectively.""

Iran and Kuwait are reportedly leading a faction within OPEC accusing Saudi Arabia of capitulating to U.S. and Russian pressure to drive the price of oil down, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the issue.

While it's no surprise that Iran is against Saudi Arabia's (oil) policies, Kuwait -- often the mediator in OPEC and Gulf issues -- reportedly being upset signals that there could be a bigger rift that could derail the alliance, the WSJ argues.

Then, there is the fact that those who suggested easing the cuts -- Saudi Arabia and Russia -- have the spare capacity to raise production, while many of the others don't. So if oil prices tick lower on a possible production increase, producers other than Russia and the Arab nations in the Gulf would have nothing to gain -- they will actually lose oil revenues.

Analysts think that OPEC is up for a tough meeting in June, and that the Saudis and Russians persuading the others that longer-term stability is preferable to short-term high oil prices will be a 'tough sell.'

""It's rational from the point of view of Iran, Venezuela, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Angola to oppose,"" Nordine Ait-Laoussine, who was Algeria's oil minister from 1991 to 1992, told Bloomberg.

Yet, it's likely that Saudi Arabia and Russia will have their way at the meeting in June, Bob McNally, founder of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House oil official, says.

""The reality is Vienna Group members with spare production capacity will increase production if they wish and those without spare will have to live with it,"" McNally told Bloomberg in an email. ""If Saudi Arabia and Russia want to increase production they will, and if Venezuela, Iran or others object, then the communique's language will be vague or silent on the prospective output boost.""

While it's unlikely that the partners will put 1 million bpd on the market in June, OPEC's overused ""market stability"" cliché as proxy for 'higher oil prices' or 'desired oil prices', will likely make it in every official statement next month. Emboldened by the pact's success, OPEC and allies aim for longer-term control of the oil market.

In a speech in Azerbaijan on Wednesday, OPEC's Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said:

""With the Declaration of Cooperation, we have initiated a new era in international energy collaboration, the likes of which the world has never seen before. What is required is to build upon this model process. We must institutionalize it and expand it even further for a sustainable market stability beyond the short term.""

11402837,2018-03-19,"Eni will reduce its oil production in Libya to 200,000 bpd in 2021 from the current 320,000 bpd, Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of the Italian oil major, said at the presentation of the group's 2018-2021 business plan.

Eni has maintained production in Libya over the past eight years, but during that time it was not possible to launch new projects, Descalzi said, noting that despite the cutback, Eni will remain in Libya.

Eni has been operating in Libya since 1959, and its exploration and production activities in the country are regulated by six Exploration and Production Sharing contracts (EPSA). The licenses of Eni's assets in Libya expire in 2042 and 2047 for oil and gas, respectively. In 2016, Eni's production in Libya averaged 346,000 bpd -- the highest level since the outbreak of the civil war, according to the company, which also noted that the Libyan upstream oil accounted for around 20 percent of its total production for the year.

Eni's 2018-2021 strategy unveiled on Friday includes finally lifting the dividend after it was cut three years ago, and places a key focus on exploration and oil and gas production growth. The firm expects its total oil and gas production to grow by 3.5 percent annually by 2021, thanks to the ramp-up and start-up of new projects, which are expected to contribute about 700,000 boepd in 2021.

However, the weight of Eni's upstream business in North Africa, including in Libya, is expected to decrease to 33 percent in 2021, from 39 percent last year.

Libya has managed to sustain its oil production at around 1 million bpd over the past couple of months and has started to raise its oil exports to Europe and the United States.

Related: Russia Will Stick To The OPEC Deal

Libya was initially exempt from the OPEC production cuts together with Nigeria because of the violence in the two countries that had substantially reduced their oil production. At the meeting at which OPEC extended the pact until the end of 2018, however, Libya and Nigeria agreed to stick to an unofficial collective cap of 2.8 million bpd of oil production.

Analysts still think that Libyan oil production will remain unstable as the risk of labor disputes and terminals blockades persists, but Libya also offers a low-cost oil resource that France's Total sees as valuable as it recently expanded its upstream Libyan operations by acquiring the 16.33-percent stake of the Waha oil concessions held by U.S. Marathon Oil Corporation.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Italy', 'Russia', 'Nigeria', 'France']",Eni To Reduce Its Oil Production In Libya | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Eni-To-Reduce-Its-Oil-Production-In-Libya.html,None,
11402838,2018-03-13,"Now that the downturn is over, oil majors are eager to show the market that they have adapted to generate more profits and return those profits to shareholders.

Three major oil firms -- two from the United States and one from Europe -- indicated over the past couple of weeks how they plan to spend some of their cash in order to create more shareholder value. And the paths that ExxonMobil, Hess Corporation, and Total SA have chosen couldn't have been more different. Of course, the various approaches depend on the company priorities, size, and shareholder base.

According to Bloomberg Gadfly columnist Liam Denning, France's Total may have made the smartest choice in the near term by spending US$450 million to buy low-cost reserves in Libya. Exxon moved to lift its capital expenditure in an effort to fund an aggressive growth plan through 2025. Hess announced US$1 billion in share buybacks to appease activist shareholders.

Two weeks ago, Total bought the 16.33-percent stake of the Waha oil concessions held by U.S. Marathon Oil Corporation for US$450 million. The acquisition gives Total access to reserves and resources of more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, with immediate production of around 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) and a significant exploration potential in the prolific Sirte Basin. Total's CEO Patrick Pouyanné described this acquisition as ""one of the best deals I've ever made"", saying that it fits one of his company's strategic priorities -- expanding in the Middle East.

U.S. supermajor Exxon outlined its strategic priorities at its annual analyst meeting last week, saying that it looks to more than double its earnings to US$31 billion by 2025 at today's oil prices, with an aggressive growth strategy that includes double-digit rates of return in all business segments.

Exxon's plan was an attempt to ease investor concerns about the underperforming stock price and profit growth in recent months, but investors and analysts focused on two key points in the strategy that diverged from the plans of most of Exxon's peers. Unlike all the rest of Big Oil, Exxon is raising capex to boost earnings in all segments. Exxon also fell short of announcing a share buyback, as some observers had hoped for.

Exxon's chairman and CEO Darren Woods said that 2018 capex would be US$24 billion, up from US$23 billion for 2017. Capex in 2019 would jump to US$28 billion, and then to around $30 billion in 2020-25.

On the day following the presentation, when asked about the drop in Exxon stock, Woods told CNBC that analysts were still digesting the fact that Exxon is looking to grow its capex, ""moving a little counter to some of our peers out there who are looking to reduce their capital expenditure profile"".

Investors and analysts are not fully convinced that Exxon raising capex is the smartest move at a time when capex discipline is still the 'new normal' with Big Oil and investors' demands.

But Allen Good, an energy strategist for Morningstar, thinks that ""Exxon's view is that it holds a host of high-return projects that can leverage its superior integrated model and thus warrant investment.""

While long-term production and profit growth have high execution risk, Exxon will be able to cover capex and dividends at $40 per barrel oil, which ensures capex and dividend safety, Good reckons. But buybacks through 2025 will likely be limited because investment, dividend growth, and a strengthening balance sheet will take priority, according to the analyst.

Speaking of buybacks, Hess Corporation's board authorized last week the purchase of US$1.0 billion of Hess common stock by the end of 2018, adding to the US$500 million share buyback program it announced at the end of last year.

In Hess's case, the buyback is seen as more of an attempt to appease activist shareholder Elliott Management Corporation, which has reportedly renewed an attempt to overhaul the oil company five years after it first expressed dissatisfaction with the management and stock performance. In December 2017, The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Elliott -- which holds 6.7 percent in Hess -- is renewing its calls for changes, including for Hess to favor buybacks over dividends.

""We are encouraged that the company has indicated that they are committed to closing the value gap and will be dynamic in exploring further steps to do so before first oil in Guyana,"" Elliott said after Hess announced the latest buyback, adding that it ""supports changes at Hess.""

Offshore Guyana, Hess and Exxon are partners in a very prolific basin, and have announced seven oil discoveries in the past three years. Guyana is a core area for upstream growth for both Exxon and Hess, with first production at one of the first discovered fields expected by 2020. The two U.S. firms are also boosting domestic shale operations, with Hess growing in the Bakken and Exxon betting big on the Permian.

France's Total, on the other hand, is not investing in the Permian, because it doesn't have access to acreage there and because it has different priorities, such as the Middle East, the North Sea, and deepwater.

The protests centered on salaries, one local source said.

Reuters ship tracking data said the Seagrace tanker had been scheduled to load on Tuesday from the Zawiya port.

The past week has seen blips of instability in the Libyan oil sector. Crude oil production at Sharara, the country's biggest oil field, was briefly suspended last week after the pipeline that feeds the crude from the field to the Zawiya terminal was blocked. That's what local sources told Bloomberg, without adding any detail regarding the cause of the pipeline's closure. Production at Sharara restarted on March 5.

Sharara pumps about 300,000 bpd, which is close to a third of Libya's total 1.1-million-bpd production. The field has experienced several outages over the past year as various groups target it -- or rather the pipeline to Zawiya -- as a means to their own ends.

Last August, for example, production at Sharara was suspended several times. First, a militant group attacked a control room at Zawiya terminal. Then, a group of protesters blockaded the pipeline from Sharara to Zawiya, again leading to the suspension of production at the field. Earlier suspensions have had to do with oilfield workers protesting their work conditions and compensation.

11402858,2018-07-01,"TOKYO and SINGAPORE (Bloomberg) -- At least some buyers of Iranian supplies in the world's biggest oil market are considering acquiescing to U.S. President Donald Trump's demands.

As the American administration piles pressure on its allies to entirely halt purchases of Iranian supplies, Japan's Fuji Oil Co. and Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical Corp. are considering ending imports from the OPEC member -- though they are yet to make a final decision. South Korea has already put some imports on hold while Emirates National Oil Co. in the UAE is trying alternatives to cargoes from the Islamic Republic.

The U.S. wants allies to end all imports of Iranian oil by a Nov. 4 deadline and isn't offering extensions or waivers to that timeline, as it targets the Persian Gulf state's economic lifeline with sanctions over its nuclear program. It's boosted speculation that a global shortage will be exacerbated, lifting prices. Fuji Oil will likely replace its cargoes with those from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi while Formosa may opt for Saudi and Iraqi crude.

""We are preparing for different scenarios, the worst-case being a total ban on Iranian imports,"" Formosa spokesman Lin Keh-Yen said by phone. ""Iranian crude imports make up a small portion of FPCC's total purchases; any loss in Iranian oil can be replaced with other grades from the spot market.""

Any lost barrels could help Saudi Arabia -- Tehran's main regional rival -- recover market share in Asia that shrank after OPEC began output curbs last year to reduce a global glut. Now, the Middle East nation is said to be planning to pump record volumes to fulfill its pledge to fill any supply gaps. Yet, that may strain its spare capacity at a time when the oil market is already coping with the collapse of Venezuela's oil industry and turmoil in Libya.

Government discussions

Fuji Oil will decide on the Iranian purchases after holding discussions with the government and other Japanese refiners, spokesman Takaaki Sobue said on Wednesday. Formosa Petrochemical will make a final decision after meeting with refinery executives and Taiwanese government officials in the coming weeks, said people with knowledge of matter, asking not to be identified as the information is private.

JXTG Holdings Inc., Japan's biggest refiner, plans to follow its government's guidance on the sanctions, and if the refiner has to end Iranian purchases, it'll ensure stable supply from other sources including in the Middle East, West Africa and potentially the U.S., a company spokesman said.

Government negotiations with the U.S. are ongoing, Takashi Yamada, director of petroleum policy at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said last week.

Refiners in South Korea, one of Iran's leading customers, are shunning a type of oil known as condensate from the Middle East nation to feed the nation's petrochemical plants. SK Innovation Co., Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co. and Hyundai Oilbank Co. have all rushed to procure supply of an alternative -- naphtha -- instead.

An official at South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said last week that the U.S. expressed its willingness to take a hard-line approach in imposing sanctions on Iran, and declined to comment on discussions about oil trade.

South Korea's government is in ongoing talks with the U.S. to seek an exemption to minimize any impact from the suspension of Iranian crude imports, the Asian nation's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, ENOC in the United Arab Emirates bought Equatorial Guinea's Alba and the U.S.'s Eagle Ford condensate as it sought to run its facility in Jebel Ali. It predominantly used Iranian South Pars and Qatari condensate when the U.S. had imposed sanctions on the Persian Gulf state earlier this decade.

At the heart of the problem for Iran's biggest customers is a U.S. threat to cut off access to the American banking system for foreign financial institutions that settle trades with the Middle East nation's central bank. Trump last month announced he was was quitting a 2015 nuclear accord between world powers and the Islamic Republic that had called for it to curb its nuclear program in return for the easing of sanctions.

Biggest buyers

Much will depend on what is done by China and India, Iran's two biggest oil customers. It's unclear if either have made a decision yet. While Beijing has held strategic talks with the Middle East nation, it hasn't disclosed whether it might scale back imports in light of renewed U.S. sanctions. When the restrictions were in place earlier this decade, the Asian nations had persisted with purchases from the Islamic Republic in spite of American criticism.

Meanwhile, India plans to seek some exemptions to continue Iranian oil imports, and is looking at alternate payment mechanisms, two government officials said earlier this month, asking not to be identified citing internal policy.

There haven't been any discussions with the government so far, said R. Ramachandran, director of refineries at India's Bharat Petroleum Corp., adding that its imports from Iran are of a ""very small quantity.""

""It's a call the government will have to take and we will be guided by that decision,"" said Arun Kumar Sharma, finance director of Indian Oil Corp., the country's biggest refiner.

11403345,2018-10-22,"CAIRO (Bloomberg) -- BP and Eni could re-start work on a project in Libya in the first quarter next year, setting the stage for the OPEC member to boost production by ""hundreds of thousands of barrels"" a day, the head of the country's state oil company said.

Crude production in the North African nation is averaging ""well above 1 MMbpd despite local security challenges,"" National Oil Corp. Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said over the weekend in a written response to questions. He expects BP and Eni to resume exploratory drilling near the Tunisian border in the first quarter. The companies, which reached an agreement on Oct. 8, could ""fast-track"" to production thanks to existing facilities in the area, he said.

""The deal is proof of the confidence that two of the leading oil majors have in NOC, and in Libya's production outlook,"" Sanalla said.

Political divisions and internal fighting have plagued Libya since 2011, when longtime leader Moammar Qaddafi was overthrown and killed. Libyan officials have sought to contain the violence and boost oil and natural gas output, just as impending U.S. sanctions on Iran's energy industry and an economic crisis in Venezuela are squeezing crude supplies worldwide.

Libya pumped 1.6 MMbpd before Qaddafi's ouster, but a spate of security issues has hobbled production this year. Output at its biggest oil field Sharara declined in July after an armed group kidnapped four workers. The NOC said this month a lack of security at the Zawiya refinery, which gets its oil from Sharara, was ""not sustainable"" for workers or production. The plant has capacity to process 120,000 bpd.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, has climbed almost 20% this year. The contract for December settlement advanced 0.4% to $80.13/bbl in Dubai.

BP and Eni agreed to resume work even after the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for an attack last month on NOC headquarters in Tripoli and said the country's oil fields were a legitimate target.

""A number"" of international companies are looking at returning to Libya, due to the country's ""low-cost-to-market"" resources and comparatively small amounts of sulfur, a contaminant, in its crude, said Sanalla, who escaped unhurt from the militants' assault.

BP had completed some seismic work at the contract areas when Qaddafi was toppled from power. It immediately halted operations, then resumed them, and then ceased activity once again in 2014 when tensions flared. Under their agreement, Italy's Eni will buy half of BP's 85% stake in the contract areas that covers about 20,850 square mi.

In another effort to spur production, Sanalla met with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and officials of Russian companies including Gazprom and Tatneft in Moscow this month.

Tatneft confirmed the talks with NOC and is interested in ""further work in Libya,"" a spokeswoman said. The company suspended operations in the country in 2011 but still has assets there, she said.

PetroChina Co. agreed to buy Libyan crude, its first term contract with NOC since 2013, a person familiar with the matter said in March. BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc reached a similar deal in January.

""There's no question that IOCs' risk appetite is growing again,"" Derek Brower, director at RS Energy Group in London, said in a text message. ""It's good news for Libya that companies are willing to take the plunge again -- and it's also an achievement for NOC and Sanalla, given what they've gone through recently. But the political risks have by no means diminished.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Libya', 'Venezuela', 'Tunisia', 'Moscow', 'Dubai', 'Tripoli', 'Russia', 'Italy', 'London']","Libya oil boss sees output jump as BP, Eni may re-start soon",https://www.worldoil.com/news/2018/10/22/libya-oil-boss-sees-output-jump-as-bp-eni-may-re-start-soon,None,
11403889,2018-12-16,"PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- North Koreans are marking the anniversary of the death of leader Kim Jong Il seven years ago with visits to statues and vows of loyalty to his son, Kim Jong Un.

As snow fell Sunday, a steady flow of North Koreans offering flowers and paying respects to the late leader could be seen at Mansu Hill in central Pyongyang, the location of huge bronze statues of the ""Dear Leader"" and national founder Kim Il Sung.

The anniversary observations were expected to continue through Monday across the country.

Though focused on remembrances of his father, the anniversary also marks Kim's own rise to power.

The death of Kim Jong Il on Dec. 17, 2011, thrust Kim into power when he was still in his late 20s and a virtual unknown figure outside of the North. But, despite many predictions from outside experts that he wouldn't be up to the task, Kim has managed to consolidate power, bolster the country's economy in the face of intense international sanctions and attain a goal his father and grandfather could only dream of -- he is the first North Korean leader to possess an arsenal of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles capable of reaching the United States.

As the nation remembered his father, there was no mention in the state media of the issues that have gotten the most attention elsewhere, including a flurry of speculation in South Korea that Kim might visit Seoul by the end of the year, or how he intends to deal with growing frustration in Washington over the slow pace of denuclearization talks between the two countries.

The national news agency, KCNA, instead ran stories about memorials to Kim Jong Il in Libya, Russia and Serbia.

Even so, the anniversary was being watched closely for any signs of change or hints of what the country's leadership may be planning in the months ahead.

With Kim's power base seemingly more solid than ever, and his recent effort to establish himself on the world stage through summits with President Donald Trump and others, North Korea watchers have been on the lookout for signs that his own personality cult is being bolstered.

Virtually all homes and public offices in North Korea feature portraits of the elder Kims, who are also memorialized in countless statues, mosaics and cenotaphs around the country. North Korean adults wear pins over their hearts bearing the likenesses of Kim Il Sung of Kim Jong Il, or both.

This year's anniversary has so far offered no major departures from past precedent.

The North has yet to come out with a Kim Jong Un pin or to order his image join the others on every wall, though Kim and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, have been referred to with increasingly lofty titles -- ""chairman"" for Kim and ""respected first lady"" for Ri. A special portrait of the young chairman was unveiled recently at a ceremony to welcome the visit of Cuba's president, but none have appeared in public since. And unlike his father and grandfather, Kim's Jan. 8 birthday has yet to be declared a national holiday or even marked on most calendars.

None of that should be assumed to be a sign of weakness, however. It could in fact indicate strength.

Kim is generally afforded the same reverential treatment by the state media and for maintaining a respectful step behind his predecessors, he is credited with showing humility and confidence.
