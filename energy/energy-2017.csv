11400440,2017-09-11,"Aboard The Papal Plane (AP) -- Pope Francis is urging President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to end a program protecting young immigrants from deportation, saying anyone who calls himself ""pro-life"" should keep families together.

""If he is a good pro-life believer he must understand that family is the cradle of life and one must defend its unity,"" Francis said during an in-flight press conference en route home from Colombia.

Francis said he hadn't read up on Trump's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Children Program, which allows some immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children to stay. About 800,000 people are affected by Trump's decision to give Congress six months to end their limbo status.

But he said in general, removing children from families ""isn't something that bears fruit for either the youngsters or their families.""

""I hope they rethink it a bit,"" he said. ""Because I heard the U.S. president speak: He presents himself as a person who is pro-life.""

Already the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has denounced Trump's decision to end the DACA program, calling it ""reprehensible"" and placing ""unnecessary fear for DACA youth and their families.""

Francis has clashed previously with Trump over issues of immigration, saying that anyone who wants to build a wall as Trump does on the Mexican border to keep out migrants is ""not Christian."" He has called for migrants and refugees to be welcomed and insisted on their rights to flee violence, natural disasters and poverty in search of a better life elsewhere.

On Sunday, though, he also acknowledged that countries have to manage migrant flows and make sure new migrants can be integrated into society.

In his airborne news conference, he was asked about Italy's new policy of stopping migrant departures from Libya, which it has achieved by supporting increased Libyan coast guard patrols and backing Libya's government in working with militias that once facilitated trafficking to now stop it.

Francis said he was grateful to both Italy and Greece for having welcomed so many migrants in. But he said governments have to manage refugee flows ""with prudence,"" taking into account how many people it can successfully integrate into its society.

""I have the impression that it is doing all it can with humanitarian care to also resolve the problem it cannot take on,"" he said, referring to efforts to improve investments in Africa so many people don't feel compelled to leave.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['United States', 'Colombia', 'Libya', 'Italy', 'Greece']",Pope Asks 'Pro-life' Trump to Rethink Young Migrant Decision,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/pope-asks-pro-life-trump-to-rethink-young-migrant-decision,None,
11400441,2017-07-26,"Accord struck without consulting key Libyan political players

A French-led effort to reunify fractured Libya failed to consult powerful local forces and risks achieving little beyond boosting the legitimacy of a renegade general who has recently racked up significant battlefield gains.

On paper, the step taken by Libya's rival leaders on Tuesday -- guided by French President Emmanuel Macron and a United Nations envoy -- was their boldest yet toward resolving Libya's six-year crisis. After talks at a country mansion outside Paris, UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and eastern military strongman Khalifa Haftar agreed to -- but didn't sign -- a text calling for a ceasefire, combining the North African crude producer's divided state oil company and holding elections ""as soon as possible.""

Yet the accord will struggle to survive the transition from French chateau to Libya's fiercely contested politics, according to analysts including Riccardo Fabiani at Eurasia Group.

""All we have is a very good photo op, which Macron and Haftar exploited very well,"" said Fabiani, senior analyst for the Middle East and North Africa. The agreement accorded Haftar a ""veneer of respect"" on the international arena -- a major achievement for a leader whose authority has so far been backed largely by Russia's Vladimir Putin and Egyptian President -- and former military chief -- Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. It was, though, reached without input from regional officials, or myriad militias and political parties whose cooperation will be needed to make it stick, he said.

Playing out just across the Mediterranean Sea, Libya's descent into chaos since the uprising that toppled Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 has fueled the two most severe cross-border challenges facing many European leaders -- the flow of poor migrants desperate to build better lives and the opportunist movement of Islamic State extremists. Macron's initiative comes after abortive attempts by Italy, the former colonizing power, to forge a peace.

While a UN-mediated peace deal was meant to unite Libya, Serraj has struggled to expand his influence outside the capital since arriving in Tripoli in March 2016. Haftar's Libyan National Army controls large parts of the country from its base in the east, this month capturing the key city of Benghazi after years of fighting with Islamist militias and earlier Islamic State jihadists.

""There is a political legitimacy that's in the hands of Prime Minister Al-Serraj and a military legitimacy that's held by General Haftar,"" Macron said as the deal was announced. ""They have decided to work together on a political process, on a security process, and for a unified economy that will benefit the Libyan people.""

Serraj and Haftar met in Abu Dhabi in May for the first time since early last year. Initially hailed as a breakthrough, analysts said later the meeting was fruitless. Each side issued its own communique after the meeting, and battlefield developments in the south of Libya soon eroded any goodwill.

With his military dominance now cemented, Haftar appears to have gone further in the talks at the Chateau de la Celle than he did in Abu Dhabi in a search for more political recognition from European countries, according to an aide to Macron.

Even so, it's unlikely to ""breach the political stalemate"" that has endured in Libya for years, said Oded Berkowitz, senior analyst for the Middle East and North Africa with geopolitical risk consultancy Max Security in Israel. Haftar controls the main oil fields and ports, and his prominence now shows there's international recognition that Haftar ""has to be involved in any political settlement,"" he said. He's now a ""force to be reckoned with.""

French officials said the goal of Tuesday's meeting was to define general guidelines that would help the UN's Special Representative to Libya, Ghassan Salame, reach an agreement leading to elections next year. Macron saluted earlier efforts of countries such as Italy, Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and the U.A.E. to seek a solution and said they'd all been involved in the preparations for the talks in France.

Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, in an interview with the newspaper La Stampa published on Tuesday, had voiced his country's irritation at Macron's initiative. Italy sees former colony Libya as part of its sphere of influence.

Italy and France have both been actively seeking a unified Libya because the disorder in the country has led to weapons flowing to Islamic militants in former French colonies in West Africa, such as Mali and Chad, and to human traffickers using Libyan beaches to ship migrants toward Italian shores.

""The Libyan people need this peace, and the Mediterranean deserves this peace,"" Macron said. ""We are directly affected.""

In an interview with France 24 television, Serraj said it was too early for him to decide whether or not to contest any election held under the plan. But while acknowledging there was much to do, he stressed real achievements. Haftar had agreed a ballot was the only way to solve the crisis and that the military must fall ""under a civilian executive authority,"" he said.

""The ball is in Haftar's court,"" according to Berkowitz, who added that the military leader stood to gain the most from the declaration in France.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Libya', 'Paris', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Tripoli', 'Russia', 'Italy', 'France', 'Benghazi', 'Tunisia', 'Morocco', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Algeria', 'United Arab Emirates']",Libya Peace Deal Must Survive Shift From Chateau to Battlefield,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-26/libya-peace-deal-must-survive-shift-from-chateau-to-battlefield,None,
11400461,2017-02-03,"Those who are waiting for the first signs of cooperation between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin should keep an eye on Libya. The scene of an open rivalry between the European Union and Russia could suddenly turn on Trump, who could turn to Putin.

QuickTake Libya's Breakdown

Libya is important for three reasons. It's the starting point of the so-called Central Mediterranean route by which tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants reach the European Union. It's also a major oil producer that can affect global prices. Lastly, the chaos in Libya makes it, in the U.S. State department's terminology, ""a terrorist safe haven."" That's why presidents Obama and Trump have sought to limit the entry of Libyan citizens and those who have visited the country.

At an informal summit on Malta on Friday the leaders of European Union states affirmed their support for the UN-backed government, run from Tripoli by Prime Minister Fayez Mustafa al-Serraj. They also backed a deal Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni signed on Thursday with Serraj. Italy is taking the lead in funding the construction of refugee camps in Libya, and the EU as a whole recently earmarked an additional 200 million euros ($215 million) for its efforts to keep potential migrants in Libya, Tunisia and Niger.

But refugees are not Putin's priority in Libya. He's far more interested in restoring Russian influence there, and establishing a military presence if he can.

Under Muammar Qaddafi, Libya was a Russian ally, a playground for Russian energy companies, and a buyer of Russian weapons. When he fell in 2011, the Russian state railroad monopoly lost a lucrative contract to build a rail line along the Mediterranean coast, one of many voided Russian investments.

Putin watched the Arab Spring with dismay -- not just because it dispatched kleptocrats like himself, but also because those secular authoritarian rulers were often replaced with Islamists. To Putin, these strongmen were a bulwark against jihadism. He drew a clear red line at Syrians' Western-backed attempt to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, forged a cordial relationship with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and restored ties with Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His alliance with Islamist Iran fits that line of behavior because Shia Iranians are hostile to the Sunni strains of extremism that Putin considers especially dangerous since they emerged as a force in separatist Chechnya in the 1990's.

In Libya, Putin's axis of secular authoritarians cannot include Serraj since he holds onto power with support from some Islamist groups and Putin's Western adversaries. Khalifa Haftar, a powerful military commander who controls eastern Libya and resists the Serraj government, fits the bill much better.

Haftar chased Islamist fighters out of Benghazi and the surrounding area and took over Libya's key oil terminals from pro-government forces last September, boosting the country's output. The Kremlin has been cultivating a relationship with Haftar, inviting him for a visit to Moscow last November and then hosting him on the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in January, where he held a teleconference with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.

Russia is obliged to follow the UN arms embargo against any Libyan forces except the al-Serraj government, so it cannot provide official military aid to Haftar. There have been unconfirmed reports, however, that the Kremlin has struck an unofficial deal to supply Haftar via Algeria, a long-time Moscow arms client.

That's potentially scary for the EU. If a Putin ally takes over Libya, any deal on their primary issue -- refugees -- could be threatened. If Haftar allowed Russian military bases in Libya, Putin's strength in Middle East politics would continue to grow as well.

This sets the scene for a potential clash between the EU on one side and Putin and Trump on the other. There are major reasons for Trump to support Haftar over Serraj. Haftar spent 20 years in the U.S., living not far from the Central Intelligence Agency's Langley headquarters and working to undermine Qaddafi, his one-time friend and ally. Trump is also highly skeptical of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's actions in Libya as the Qaddafi regime disintegrated, and, like Putin, he doesn't believe in imposing democracy on Middle Eastern nations where Islamist groups enjoy popular support.

Haftar and his supporters celebrated Trump's victory last November, seeing the new U.S. president as a potential ally against jihadists.

Moscow likely wouldn't mind testing the opportunities for cooperation with Trump in Libya. On Thursday, the state propaganda agency RIA Novosti published a column by Avigdor Eskin, an Israeli political consultant close to the Russian nationalist right, asserting that the Trump administration -- namely National Security Adviser Michael Flynn -- had a plan on Libya that might involve Russian cooperation via Haftar. The supposed plan involves building new ""micro-cities"" rather than refugee camps in Libya, with factories and oil facilities to put them to work.

Although that sounds like wishful thinking, the Kremlin is highly likely to approach the Trump administration with offers of pacifying Libya and thus weakening the Islamic State. The U.S. wouldn't even need to do anything except turn a blind eye to Russian support of Haftar. As in Syria, Putin's unique selling proposition is that he is not squeamish when it comes to dealing with strongmen and that, unlike any Western leader, he is unconstrained by the need to seek political support at home: He knows by now how to create it through a powerful propaganda machine.

If Trump's isolationist team is willing to cut its risks and outsource at least part of its promised fight against Islamist terrorism to Russia, an understanding on Libya is a possible first step down that road.

11400769,2017-03-14,"Force majeure may be declared at ports if fighting continues

Libya's crude output dropped 13 percent as clashes among rival armed groups over the last 11 days led to the closing of some of the OPEC nation's biggest oil export terminals, forcing a number of fields to halt production.

Output is down to 602,900 barrels a day, Jadalla Alaokali, a board member at National Oil Corp., said by phone Monday. Production was about 700,000 barrels a day before fighting broke out on March 3. The offshore Al Jurf field run by Mabruk Oil Operations is under maintenance, contributing to the reduced supplies, Alaokali said.

Es Sider, the country's biggest oil port, and Ras Lanuf, its third-largest, remain closed, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the person doesn't have permission to speak to media. Crude production halted at Waha Oil Co., which pumps crude to Es Sider. Waha is a joint venture between the state oil company National Oil Corp., Hess Corp., Marathon Oil Corp. and ConocoPhillips.

The clashes dealt a blow to recent gains in the North African nation's oil output. Exports had resumed from Es Sider and other facilities that were previously shut amid fighting in the country, which has Africa's largest crude reserves. Output in February was about 700,000 barrels a day, almost double the level of the previous year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

The Petroleum Facilities Guard, a United Nations-backed force, last week said they took control of oil installations at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, following their capture by a militia group called the Benghazi Defense Brigades earlier this month. The ports had previously been controlled by eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar.

The NOC will have to declare force majeure at ports if the fighting continues, Alaokali said. Force majeure is a legal status protecting a party from liability if it can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control. The status was imposed on the two ports in December 2014 when armed groups attacked the area, damaging storage tanks and infrastructure. It was lifted about two years later.

The ports have escaped damage so far, ""but the risk is relatively high,"" Alaokali said.

Air strikes at the two ports have continued for the last two nights and resulted in some damage to parts of the maintenance building at Es Sider and parts of the petrochemicals factory at Ras Lanuf, Idries Bu Khamada, head of the Petroleum Facilities Guard, said by phone Monday. The damage to Es Sider shouldn't prevent exports, he said.

Waha Oil has a capacity of more than 300,000 barrels a day, according to the NOC website. Its production dropped by half to 40,000 barrels a day after the closing of Es Sider port, before it came to a complete halt at the end of last week. The country has also been rescheduling crude loadings at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf and transferring them to other ports like Zueitina and Brega.

The Al Jurf field is 50 percent owned by the NOC, 37.5 percent by Total SA and 12.5 percent by Wintershall AG, according to the Mabruk website.

Libya is struggling to revive oil production amid political turmoil and conflict among forces competing to control its energy assets. The country is still pumping far less than the 1.6 million barrels a day it produced before a 2011 uprising that ushered in years of instability.

Libya said it's struggling to restore oil production and fellow OPEC members are sparing the nation from having to participate in their deal to cut output.

The North African nation has revived output to almost 1 million barrels a day, but it's ""very difficult'' to say when that could increase to 1.25 million a day, said Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of the National Oil Corp. That's a production target Libya gave to fellow producers at a meeting in July.

""We're still suffering from the lack of budget,'' Sanalla told reporters in London after two days of meetings with diplomats and oil companies. Libya has explained its challenges to OPEC, which ""understands the situation very well,'' he said.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia are leading a global coalition of oil producers in supply cuts aimed at clearing a world glut. The accord spared two OPEC members, Libya and Nigeria, while they tackled domestic crises that have hobbled their oil industries.

A recovery in the output of both nations prompted speculation they may be asked to join the agreement by restraining their output. Nigeria said it has now effectively capped its production, but no ceiling has been applied to Libya. At a meeting last month OPEC and its allies said they welcomed further recovery in both countries. Sanalla said he hopes to attend the next formal meeting of OPEC and its partners, scheduled for Nov. 30 in Vienna.

While Libya has resolved some internal disputes and restored output from a low of 550,000 barrels a day in April, the country still faces major challenges. The state-run oil company is only receiving about 25 percent of its investment budget and production could decline without the needed money, Sanalla said.

Production has dropped by as much as 90,000 barrels on a single day because of insufficient funding for maintenance, Sanalla said. The nation lost more than 6 million barrels of potential output between July and September. Returning to full capacity of 1.6 million barrels a day ""will take some time,'' he said.

Twelve of the 19 storage tanks at the Es Sider export terminal are inoperative, and half of the 13 tanks at Ras Lanuf are out of action, he said.

The NOC held meetings this week in the U.K. with a number of stakeholders in Libya's oil industry, from local tribes to international oil companies such as Eni SpA and Total SA. The meeting reached a ""statement of principles'' that will be passed to the conference on Libya's political future to be chaired by the United Nations.

The principles include the resolution that NOC has a monopoly on the exploration, production, transport and export of oil and gas, and that all of the state-run company's revenues will be sent to the Central Bank of Libya.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Libya', 'London', 'Russia', 'Nigeria', 'Vienna', 'United Kingdom']",Libya Says Its Oil Recovery Is Struggling and OPEC Sympathizes,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/libya-says-its-oil-recovery-is-struggling-and-opec-sympathizes,None,

El Feel, or Elephant, stopped production, Wessam Al-Messmari, an office manager for the Petroleum Facilities Guard that is protecting the field, said Sunday by phone. State-run National Oil Corp. declared force majeure at the deposit, according to a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public.

The Hamada oil field will gradually stop pumping through Monday because of the pipeline closing, Arabian Gulf Oil Co. spokesman Omran al-Zwai said Sunday. Force majeure was also declared on Hamada, he said. Force majeure is a legal clause protecting a party from liability if it can't fulfill a contract for reasons beyond its control. An armed group closed the pipelines to Hamada and El Feel, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Libya revived its oil production and exports before the recent disruptions. In July, crude production was at a four-year high and exports were the most in three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the expansion has helped Libya's oil-dependent economy, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is trying to cut global supplies. That effort has been undermined by recovering output at OPEC members Libya and Nigeria.

Libya's biggest field, Sharara, has been shut for about a week after an armed group closed the pipeline that linked the deposit to an export terminal, Al-Messmari said at the time. The field is still not pumping, a person familiar with the matter said Sunday.

Libya, which holds Africa's largest crude reserves, pumped 1.02 million barrels a day in July. It was producing 1.6 million barrels a day before a 2011 revolt set off years of fighting between rival governments and militias.

El Feel is operated by a joint venture between Italy's Eni SpA and Libya's NOC. It has an output capacity of 90,000 barrels a day.

The 2006 World Cup final should have been a triumph for Italians, but all people remember now is the iconic French soccer captain Zinedine Zidane headbutting an opponent in the last minutes.

The controversy overshadowed much of the glory for the winning team that night and the subsequent carping of French fans convinced many Italians that their bigger, richer neighbor will never give them the respect they deserve, whether the field is sports, business or politics.

That resentment burst into the open on Wednesday when Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France is ready to nationalize the STX shipyard in Saint-Nazaire if its would-be Italian buyer Fincantieri SpA doesn't accept his government's conditions. Fincantieri stock plunged as much as 13 percent and Italian ministers erupted.

Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said there's ""no reason"" why Fincantieri should accept only a minority stake and his colleague Carlo Calenda, in charge of economic development, told Ansa newswire that Italy is ready to walk away from the deal after Le Maire changed terms already agreed with the previous administration, citing the need to protect a key national asset from foreign influence. The Italians have struggled to accept that rationale, given STX's previous owner was Korean.

President Emmanuel Macron's June election victory may have reinvigorated the Franco-German relationship at the heart of the European Union. But ties with Italy, the continent's No. 3 economy, are going from bad to worse, suggesting that competition for jobs, security, and indeed glory, could quickly dampen hopes for tighter EU cooperation.

""This situation is not good for business and not good for European integration,"" Alessandro Ungaro, a security and defense analyst at Rome's Institute for International Affairs, said in a phone interview. ""We were hoping for a more market-friendly and pro-European stance, but they're rejecting a European ally and reasonable industrial project in favor of a possible nationalization.""

Italian officials were already smarting when they woke up on Wednesday. The previous day Macron had snubbed their Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni by leaving him out of peace talks in Paris with Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and Khalifa Haftar, leader of the country's powerful eastern-based military force.

Italy sees Libya, its former colony, as its sphere of influence. Privately many Italian officials blame French meddling for contributing to the collapse of the North African country's institutions. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said there were ""too many initiatives"" on Libya that weren't being coordinated.

On Wednesday, Italy's front pages were filled with anger at the French. ""Macron's blitz overshadows Italy,"" said La Stampa, later adding on its website, ""Italy and France head for naval battle."" Il Messaggero went with ""Libya deal without Italy.""

In response, Gentiloni invited the Libyan leader al-Serraj to Rome and held his own press conference on television to reassert his influence.

""This is getting a bit childish,"" said Sofia Ventura, a professor of politics at the University of Bologna, whose father is Italian and mother is French. ""The problem is individual countries are looking after their interests and not really keeping with the European spirit. Among the bigger nations, Italy is weaker, it can't fully compete.""

That's the crux of it.

The past decade has been a period of economic decline for Italy that has left its companies vulnerable to foreign predators, and France has been particularly acquisitive.

French companies have announced at least $42 billion in Italian takeovers in the last five years, including Essilor International SA's deal to buy Luxottica and Amundi SA's acquisition of UniCredit SpA's Pioneer Investments, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That's six times Italian purchases in France. Since 2011, Lactalis SA gained control of Italian dairy giant Parmalat SpA, Electricite de France bought energy company Edison SpA and LVMH acquired jeweler Bulgari and fashion brands Fendi and Loro Piana in what some Italians saw as an invasion of their territory in the fashion industry.

""It has been mostly a one-way relationship, with France dominating also based on recent history and economic trends,"" Yannick Naud, a French investor at Banque Audi in Geneva, said by phone. ""The same tension is replicated in food and on the soccer pitch.""

Indeed, the years since that final in Berlin have been similarly cruel to Italian soccer. Where the success of AC Milan once helped drive the political rise of its owner, Silvio Berlusconi, the money that made the Italian league Europe's best in the 1990s has dried up and Milan was sold to foreign investors earlier this year.

11400793,2017-07-19,"NOC Chairman Sanalla gains influence amid political vacuum

Libya's rebounding oil output is undermining the supply curbs masterminded by Saudi Arabia and Russia. But any pleas for the OPEC member to exercise restraint will probably be resisted by the technocrat overseeing the North African nation's turnaround.

Production has climbed to a four-year high of 1.1 million barrels a day, with Libya adding output since April that's equivalent to more than a quarter of the cuts agreed by OPEC and its allies.

The restoration of Libyan oil supply has put the spotlight on National Oil Corp. Chairman Mustafa Sanalla, whose influence has waxed in a country divided between a weak United Nations-backed government in the west and military strongman in the east. When OPEC meets with Russia in St. Petersburg this week, Sanalla will speak for a nation that's causing as much angst as U.S. shale drillers.

""Sanalla has become the central figure in the oil and gas sector,"" Geoff Porter, founder of the North Africa Risk Consulting, said in an interview. ""His job is to produce as much oil as possible while he can and I think that's what he is going to continue to try to do.""

When OPEC, Russia and other producers agreed last December to cut production to boost prices, Libya easily secured an exemption. The nation with Africa's biggest oil reserves was pumping about half a million barrels a day of crude, less than a third of its pre-conflict capacity.

Libya was off the radar, skipping OPEC meetings and not providing the group with monthly production data. Now, with output surpassing the symbolic 1 million barrels-a-day mark, OPEC members want Libya at the table in St. Petersburg. While it's unclear if Libya will send a representative to the ministers' meeting on July 24, Sanalla will attend a technical meeting two days earlier.

Libya will share with the committee ""the factors enabling and constraining"" its recovery in output, Sanalla said in a statement on Tuesday.

As for joining the supply curbs as Ecuador deals a blow to OPEC unity, Sanalla's previously hinted that Libya's challenges won't make that easy.

""Libya's political, humanitarian and economic situation needs to be taken into account if we are going to talk about production caps,"" Sanalla said in a July 11 statement, following suggestions from other OPEC members that the country could be asked to curb output.

Sanalla's growing stature in a divided country -- General Khalifa Haftar controls eastern Libya and vies for power with the UN-backed Tripoli-based government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj -- was on display last month in an opinion piece in the New York Times, where he urged the NOC to remain aloof from the nation's internal politics.

With the NYT piece and the nation's surging oil output, Sanalla ""demonstrated to the other stakeholders in Libya that he has the international standing that almost anyone else lacks,"" said Mattia Toaldo, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

""Sanalla is a mix between a diplomat-in-chief and an oil minister in the Saudi tradition, who used to do big diplomacy mostly through oil,"" Toaldo said.

Last month, Sanalla met with both Algeria's energy and foreign affairs ministers, discussing how Algeria could help unify belligerent factions ""to stabilize the country and its economy,"" according to the state-owned Algerian Press Service.

Sanalla has sought to remain neutral through Libya's political turmoil since taking over in May 2014, but he also reasserted the authority of the Tripoli-based NOC against its eastern counterpart, which occasionally tried to strike oil deals independently. Under his tenure, Libya has signed contracts with international companies, ended a blockade of its ports and increased production more than fourfold from 250,000 barrels a day.

Indeed, rather than capping production, the head of the state-owned oil company is more concerned about boosting output further. When Russia's Rosneft PJSC signed a deal in February to invest in exploration and production in Libya, the NOC said it was part of its goal to increase output to 2.1 million barrels a day by 2020.

That determination to increase oil output stems from the economic hardship Libya has experienced since the state collapsed following the 2011 revolution that toppled dictator Moammar Al-Qaddafi.

The economy has contracted for the past three years, a distinction it shares only with Yemen -- a country engulfed in a civil war -- among 11 oil exporters tracked by the International Monetary Fund in the region spanning the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Libya is the only OPEC member in the Middle East and North Africa to have seen the oil price it needs to balance its budget increase since 2014.

While Sanalla has ambitions to boost production, the country may already be bumping up against a short-term ""implicit"" ceiling that's slightly above 1 million barrels a day, according to Toaldo. Until investment raises capacity further, that means a cap at around that level might be possible, he said.

Labor unrest and political violence also loom over the nation's ability to sustain output, said Porter of North Africa Risk Consulting. Much also hinges on the NOC boss himself.

Libya's oil production has plunged by almost a quarter after workers shut the OPEC country's biggest field to protest lack of medical care following the death of a colleague, a person familiar with the matter said.

Output has fallen to 618,000 barrels a day after workers halted production at Sharara field, protesting the death of a colleague and demanding better working conditions, the person said, asking not to be identified because they aren't authorized to speak to the media. The country was producing 807,000 barrels a day on Monday, Jadalla Alaokali, board member at National Oil Corp., said at the time.

Libya has sought to boost crude exports but fighting and labor unrest at ports and fields have crippled these efforts. In the country where much of the foreign staff of international companies left following a 2011 uprising, local employees run risks as they continue to produce and export crude. Libya was exempt from production cuts agreed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied suppliers on May 25 to battle a global glut.

Workers at Sharara shut production at the field Wednesday to protest the death of a colleague due to lack of proper emergency medical care, Bassam Yekhlef, a technician at the field, said by phone.

""We're demanding better medical service and better working conditions,"" Yekhlef said. ""We don't want to cause harm to production or to our country and we will end the protest very soon, once the management responds to our demands. We generate millions of dollars to our nation and we deserve a better treatment.""

The shutdown is only temporary and a force majeure is unlikely to be declared, an NOC official said on Wednesday. Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of state producer National Oil Corp., didn't answer phone calls or text messages seeking comment.

Sharara has a capacity of 330,000 barrels a day and is operated by a joint venture between Libya's NOC and Repsol SA, Total SA, OMV AG and Statoil ASA.

Libya's crude output exceeds 800,000 barrels a day and could be even higher if not for internal disputes that led to losses in production by Wintershall AG.

The North African country would be pumping almost 1 million barrels a day if it weren't for a disagreement between the state-run National Oil Corp. and Libya's Presidential Council that led Wintershall to shut down its production, according to the NOC. Wintershall said it stopped pumping oil at its onshore Concession 96 because it wasn't included in the latest lifting programs for Amna grade crude at Libya's Zueitina terminal.

""There are no technical reasons for the loss of production,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in an emailed statement. ""Apart from the Wintershall shut-in, we lost a significant amount of production in April from the Sharara and El Feel fields, which were blockaded by units of the Petroleum Facilities Guards.""

Libya's oil output is at the highest since October 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The increase adds to the challenge that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers face after agreeing last year to pump less crude to counter a glut. Saudi Arabia and Russia said on Monday that they would consider prolonging their output cuts for longer than the six-month extension OPEC is widely expected to agree to when the group meets on May 25.

Political divisions and fighting between armed groups have disrupted Libyan output as the country with Africa's largest crude reserves struggles to revive its most vital industry. Libya's feuding administrations agreed last week to unite state institutions. The nation was producing about 700,000 barrels a day at the end of April, Jadalla Alaokali, an NOC board member, said at that time.

Fighting in early March caused two of Libya's main oil terminals to close, forcing a number of fields to stop pumping. The ports, along the central coast, have since reopened. Libya pumped as much as 1.6 million barrels a day before an uprising in 2011 led to a plunge in output, and it's currently one of the smallest producers in OPEC.

The NOC statement referred to a resolution that the Tripoli-based Presidential Council issued in March giving itself prerogatives over Libyan energy matters. Sanalla rejected the decree at the time and called on the council to revoke it.

Wintershall, based in Kassel, Germany, stopped producing at Concession 96 on March 7, the company said Wednesday in an emailed statement.

It wouldn't be ""economic"" to keep producing at the concession without being able to export, Wintershall said in the statement.

Libya's crude production rebounded to about 660,000 barrels a day as the OPEC nation's biggest oil field resumed output after about a week of disruption.

Force majeure on the Zawiya export terminal was lifted after pumping resumed Sunday at Sharara, the nation's biggest oil field, Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of Libya's state-run National Oil Corp., said Monday by phone. Libya's overall production is 660,000 barrels a day, according to a person familiar with the matter who isn't authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be identified. Libya's output had dropped to about 500,000 barrels a day last week when production was halted at Sharara, according to the same person.

Libya, with Africa's largest oil reserves, is struggling to recover from years of conflict between rival governments and militias. Its production was exempted from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' production cuts, because of its internal strife. Some OPEC members and non-members are calling for the production cuts to be extended beyond June.

""With the lifting, it's positive for oil exports out of Libya,"" Michael Poulsen, oil risk manager at A/S Global Risk Management Ltd. in Middelfart, Denmark, said by phone. ""The assumption is that it will continue into the foreseeable future,"" he said, cautioning that ""the security situation is not 100 percent resolved.""

Brent crude, a global benchmark, rose 2 cents to $53.55 a barrel by 2:01 p.m. in Dubai.

Libya's increased oil output ""would have a bearish effect, but right now the market is more focused on potential extended cuts"" by OPEC, he said.

Libya's NOC had declared force majeure on Sharara crude last Tuesday, a clause which relieves it from delivery obligations due to circumstances outside its control. The same restrictions are in still place for loadings from the Wafa oil field and the Mellitah export terminal, Sanalla said. Sharara's production resumed Sunday, with output at 160,000 barrels a day, according to the person familiar.

Libya has sought to boost crude exports after fighting among rival militias hobbled oil production following the overthrow in 2011 of Moammar Al Qaddafi. The conflict showed signs of calming in recent months, with oil output rising from as little as 260,000 barrels a day in August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Libya pumped 1.6 million barrels daily before Qaddafi's ouster.

The vessel Minerva Kythnos, currently north of Malta, will arrive at 11 p.m. Tuesday to load 700,000 barrels of Sharara crude at Zawiya, according to three people familiar with shipments from the port.

Sharara, which was producing 221,000 barrels a day before the halt, is operated by a joint venture between NOC and Repsol SA, Total SA, OMV AG and Statoil ASA. The field's total capacity is 330,000 barrels a day.

Rosneft PJSC signed investment and crude-purchasing agreements with Libya's National Oil Corp. as more international companies return to the North African country to gain access to Africa's largest reserves.

Moscow-based Rosneft agreed to invest in exploration and production in Libya, the state-run NOC said Tuesday in a statement on its website, without specifying the amount or timing of the investment. The companies signed a separate accord for Rosneft to buy Libyan crude.

The deals are part of a bigger push by the NOC to encourage additional investments by foreign oil companies to help Libya increase its production to 2.1 million barrels a day by 2020, according to the statement. Rosneft's press service declined to comment when contacted by phone.

Libya, one of OPEC's smallest producers, is trying to revive output and sales of oil in spite of continuing political uncertainty and conflict between rival administrations and armed groups. Any increase in production may complicate efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to end a global crude glut. Libya pumped 1.6 million barrels a day before a 2011 revolt set off years of fighting that prompted foreign investors to withdraw.

OPEC agreed with other oil producers including Russia to reduce their collective output by 1.8 million barrels a day, starting Jan. 1. Libya was exempted from the cuts as its works to restore its oil industry.

""We need the assistance and investment of major international oil companies to reach our production goals and stabilize our economy,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in the statement.

Jadadalla Alaokali, an NOC board member, said last week that Libya's crude production exceeded 700,000 barrels a day and is due to reach 1.2 million barrels a day by August and 1.7 million by March 2018, when the nation's ports and export terminals will be operating at full capacity. Eni SpA and Total SA are currently working in Libya ""without difficulty,"" and Schlumberger Ltd. resumed operations in the country about three months ago, Alaokali said in an interview in Cairo.

NOC and BP Plc officials discussed cooperation in oil exploration and production on Jan. 25 in London. The Libyans also met with Germany's Wintershall AG on Feb. 8.

Libya's biggest oil field, Sharara, operated by Repsol SA, re-opened in December. The Eni-run El-Feel deposit is due to re-open within a month and produce an initial 75,000 barrels a day, Alaokali said last week.

While the halt at the pipeline that carries crude to Libya's biggest export terminal will keep output below the cap it agreed to last month, it is said to need about a week for repairs. Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute was said to report U.S. inventories dropped last week. Government data is also forecast to show stockpiles declined.

Libya's biggest oil field stopped pumping after a workers' protest, according to a person familiar with the situation, a sign of the challenges vexing the politically fragmented nation as it seeks to restore production.

Management is negotiating with protesters at the Sharara field in western Libya, and production may resume as early as Monday, said the person, who asked not to be identified for lack of authorization to speak to news media. The field was pumping 275,000 barrels a day as of July 12, a person with knowledge of the situation said at the time.

Libya's crude output and exports reached a fresh three-year high last month as fighting among armed militias abated and leaders of the country's rival administrations agreed in principal on steps to unite the nation. The recovery in the country holding Africa's largest crude reserves makes it harder for OPEC and allied oil-producing nations to curb a global supply surplus that's depressing prices for crude.

The North African producer shipped about 865,000 barrels a day of crude in July, tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. That was a gain of 11 percent from June, which was already the highest since at least July 2014.

The speed at which Libya can revive crude sales is critical for the oil market because, together with Nigeria, the nation wasn't bound by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries supply restrictions that helped limit output this year. OPEC extended the cuts accord, and Libya's exemption from it, through March 2018.

Libya slid into chaos after the armed uprising that toppled and killed former strongman Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, with myriad armed groups and two administrations vying for control of the country's energy facilities.

OPEC may need to consider extending its oil-cuts agreement when the group meets in November, as crude markets are taking too long to recover, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which already prolonged its cuts accord with other major producers through the first quarter of next year, may have to discuss a further extension, Al Mazrouei said in an interview with Bloomberg TV's Francine Lacqua. Increased output from Libya and Nigeria, which are both exempt from cutting, is complicating OPEC's effort to re-balance the market, he said.

""It looks like we may need to consider expanding the time horizon"" of the output curbs, he said. ""But that's a decision that's going to be discussed probably in our next meeting in November."" The U.A.E. is the fourth-biggest producer in OPEC, which plans its next ministerial meeting on Nov. 30.

The recovery in crude prices ""will drag us into 2018,"" he said. ""Is it going to be the first quarter or the second half of 2018? We need to monitor that."" OPEC needs more reductions in oil inventories and ""some control of production from some of those countries which were not part of the deal,"" he said.

Oil slumped into a bear market last month and Brent crude, the international benchmark, is trading at about $48, a gain of less than $2 since the cuts were agreed on last year. While demand will be almost 2 million barrels a day higher in the second half of the year compared with the first six months, according to OPEC estimates, rising supply inside and outside OPEC suggests the cuts won't put a significant dent in bloated global inventories.

The committee monitoring compliance with the cuts recommended keeping an extension of the agreement beyond the first quarter of next year ""as an option, should further action be required for the stabilization of the market,"" according to a statement posted on the OPEC website after the committee met on Monday in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Rising supply from Nigeria and Libya, exempted last year from trimming output because of their internal strife, is proving to be a challenge for OPEC and allied producers as they try to counter an oversupply, Al Mazrouei said.

""We need to think of a ceiling or a mechanism for how we control the production from those two countries,"" he said.

Crude oil inventories will decline at a faster pace worldwide in the second half of the year as demand increases and OPEC members comply better with a global agreement to cut output, Kuwait's OPEC Governor Haitham al-Ghais said.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers including Russia agreed in May to extend their supply-cuts deal through March 2018 because stockpiles hadn't fallen to their five-year historical average -- the goal of the agreement. Yet for the past two weeks, U.S. crude inventories have declined, exceeding analyst expectations.

""I see this trend continuing with more conformity from OPEC and non-OPEC producers, coupled with a further growth in demand,"" said al-Ghais, who was appointed Kuwait's OPEC governor last month. It would be ""illogical"" for OPEC to change strategy now, he said in a phone interview in Istanbul. Kuwait leads the committee monitoring the output curbs.

OPEC's compliance with the supply cutbacks fell in June to the lowest level since the deal started in January, the International Energy Agency said Thursday. Rising production from OPEC is threatening a re-balancing of the market, with the group's output last month at the highest level this year, the IEA said. Benchmark Brent crude prices have slumped this year amid concerns that increased supply from Libya, Nigeria and the U.S. is negating the impact of OPEC's cuts.

Concerns that supplies will keep climbing in Libya and Nigeria, both exempt from the cuts deal, are ""not justified"" because their production is fluctuating within a range of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day on average, al-Ghais said. ""We need to see if these increases will be sustained and stable,"" he said.

Libya's production has risen to 1.05 million barrels a day, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said Wednesday. That's the highest level since June 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nigeria is producing 1.7 million barrels a day, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Kachikwu told reporters Wednesday. The nation's output has climbed 17 percent this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

The committee reviews conditions in the market and sends findings to the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee led by Kuwait's oil minister.

A proposal that Libya and Nigeria could have to accept limits on their crude production probably wouldn't be enough to put OPEC's faltering efforts to eliminate a global supply glut back on track.

The two African nations -- which were exempt from the supply curbs agreed last year due to internal strife -- have added enough production in the last two months to offset Saudi Arabia's cut. Should the pair accept a cap at their desired levels of output, OPEC and its allies led by Russia would still have to adjust their own quotas to compensate for the increase, said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, president of Geneva-based consultants Nalcosa and former energy minister of Algeria.

""It's not going to be easy just to say 'Maybe we should just bring Nigeria and Libya into the line and it will be fine',"" Ait-Laoussine said. Adding those two countries without agreeing on new production ceilings for the other participants in the deal would simply be ""exacerbating the problem of excess supply,"" he said.

Several OPEC nations plus non-members Russia and Oman will meet in St. Petersburg on July 24 to check up on the success of their agreement to curb output, reduce swollen global inventories and boost oil prices. Since ministers from the group last met in May, oil has fallen into a bear market as analysts and traders lose faith that the cuts are working. Market watchers including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say deeper cuts are needed to finish the job of rebalancing the maket.

Changing quotas for existing participants in the agreement would be ""opening a big can of warms,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at Capital Economics. The group briefly considered and rejected the idea of deeper cuts back in May and Pugh doubts there is much political will to revise the accord now.

Crafting last year's cuts agreement was a major undertaking. Talks started early in 2016 after prices fell to the lowest in 12 years, but a first round of talks in Doha in April ended in failure. They reconvened in Algiers in September and an accord to collectively reduce the output of 11 OPEC and 11 non-OPEC nations by as much as 1.8 million barrels a day was finally clinched in December.

With deeper cuts currently not on the agenda, according to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, the group is exploring other ways the agreement could be adjusted. They have invited Libya and Nigeria to the meeting in Russia to discuss the stability of their production, Issam Almarzooq, the Kuwait oil minister said in Istanbul on July 9.

Monthly data compiled by Bloomberg show the two nations added 440,000 barrels a day of production in May and June as improved stability allowed the restart of oil fields. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de-facto leader, has reduced output by 460,000 this year.

Libya's production even went above the symbolic 1 million barrels-a-day mark earlier this month, the first time in four years. However, the country remains politically volatile and oil output and exports could still be vulnerable to disruptions by armed factions and restive workers.

""OPEC and Russia have to contend with the fact is that there is output growth elsewhere diluting their efforts,"" BNP Paribas SA's Head of Commodity-Market Strategy Harry Tchilinguirian said in a note to clients. ""Nigeria, Libya and U.S. shale oil feature prominently as an offset"" to the cuts, he said.

Ait-Laoussine was skeptical that Libya or Nigeria would agree on caps that were lower than their desired production levels since they have been ""deprived"" of their full capacity for some time. Should they reach their goals of 1.25 million barrels a day and 1.8 million barrels a day, respectively, overall OPEC production by year-end may be close to 33 million barrels a day, he estimates.

Libya's El-Feel oil field, operated by a venture between Eni SpA and the state producer, re-opened after a two-year halt in operations that crimped the OPEC nation's output, according to a person familiar with the situation.

The field, also known as Elephant, re-opened on Wednesday, said the person, who asked not to be identified because of a lack of authorization to speak to media. It hasn't resumed pumping oil yet because of an electricity outage, Petroleum Facilities Guard Brigadier Idris Bukhamada said by phone. Authorities are working to resolve the power stoppage soon, he said.

El-Feel in western Libya was due to re-open in December, but guards demanding benefits prevented that from happening, National Oil Corp. said in January. The deposit, which was closed since April 2015, has an output capacity of 80,000 barrels a day, according to an NOC statement posted on the company's website on April 16.

A revival in Libya's production will put pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers that agreed last year to cut output to rein in a glut and shore up prices. The North African nation, exempted from OPEC's cuts because of its internal strife, was producing 490,000 barrels a day as of April 11, less than a third of the 1.6 million it pumped before a 2011 uprising.

Libya's biggest oil port was seized by an armed group, dealing a blow to the North African country as it seeks to revive production of its most important commodity. Brent crude futures climbed.

Benghazi Defense Brigades, a militia that's not allied to the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, took control of the Es Sider terminal on Friday afternoon, according to people with knowledge of matter who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to speak to the media. The facility had previously been under the control of eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar.

""That is a considerable blow to Haftar,"" said Mattia Toalda, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""We have to see if there is an immediate impact on exports. But for confidence in Libya's production it's a blow.""

The clashes show just how vulnerable Libya's recent oil-production surge is to conflict that escalated in late 2014 but that had shown signs of calming in the past few months. The nation pumped about 700,000 barrels a day in February, almost doubling from a year-ago, according to information compiled by Bloomberg.

Brent crude futures climbed as high as $55.86 a barrel following the port's seizure. They were at $55.64 at 4:19 p.m. in London.

Bushra, the Benghazi Defense Brigades news website, published photos showing their fighters at the Ras Lanuf airport.

While the port was under his control, Haftar had allowed to let Libya's National Oil Corp., part of the Tripoli-backed government, use Es Sider for oil exports.

Earlier, workers at the terminal had fled to nearby Ras Lanuf as Haftar's forces sought to repel the attack, Saad Dinar, head of the oil workers' union in eastern Libya, said by phone.

The Benghazi Defense Brigades stronghold is in Jufra, on the western edge of nation's oil crescent, rather than the city of Benghazi, which is in the east.

There have been skirmishes in the area between the two sides before. Friday's fighting marks an escalation and highlights threats to the North African country's efforts to restore its crude production following two years of conflict.

11401041,2017-04-10,"Local Afghan leaders accuse Russia of arming Taliban in north

Russia and the U.S. are increasingly sparring over Afghanistan, adding to rapidly souring ties between the Kremlin and President Donald Trump's administration.

U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has voiced alarm at Russia's actions in Afghanistan, where it's been cultivating links with the Taliban amid a campaign waged by the terrorist group against Afghan and NATO forces.

His comments come as local Afghan officials and a former Taliban commander say there is evidence Russia is supplying arms to the insurgents. U.S. officials won't go that far in public, but U.S. Central Command chief General Joseph Votel has told a congressional panel that Russia was probably providing the group with weapons.

Moscow's support for the Taliban risks adding another front to tensions with Washington after Trump last week ordered a missile strike on an airbase in Syria. The frictions are set to loom large over the meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in Italy, after which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to travel to Moscow.

It also highlights the task for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani as he struggles to contain the Taliban amid a deteriorating security situation. The Taliban controls or contests over half the country's populated areas, according to U.S. government estimates, making it harder for America to extract itself from its longest-ever war. Ghani has repeatedly called on the Taliban to join peace talks.

The Kremlin denies arming the group. Russia's special envoy for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov said in a March 30 interview the accusations were an invention by the Afghan government and its allies to ""justify their own failure on the battlefield"".

Still, Russia, loath to allow another permanent U.S. base near its borders, says it supports the Taliban's demand for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan. And it has accused the U.S. of sabotaging its efforts to help end the conflict by staying away from an April 14 peace initiative in Moscow.

""Russia is actively building contacts to have levers of influence in case the situation enters a crisis phase,"" said Petr Topychkanov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""That's viewed very negatively in the U.S., which is the main sponsor in Afghanistan.""

Trump promised during his election campaign to mend ties with Vladimir Putin. But the relationship quickly deteriorated as the new administration vowed to keep sanctions on Russia imposed over the Ukraine conflict and criticized Moscow's actions in Syria and Libya.

Russia has denounced the U.S. air strikes on Syria, which the U.S. launched after blaming the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 people.

After its 1979 invasion turned into a 10 year war that helped speed the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has for years branded the U.S. effort in the central Asian nation a failure. By offering support to its former enemy the Taliban, Russia is seeking to exploit the insurgency and displace American influence.

Officials in Moscow disclosed at the end of last year they've been in contact with the Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 until being overthrown in the U.S.-led invasion. Russia says it now has common interests with the Taliban because the group is fighting Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for a number of deadly attacks inside Russia.

Inside Afghanistan, the Russian role is viewed with suspicion. Moscow ""must help the Afghan army fight international terrorism instead of helping the Taliban,"" said Defense Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri. He could not confirm if Russia is providing aid to the insurgents.

The Taliban receives small arms, rocket launchers, cash and ammunition from Russia via Tajikistan, said Nasruddin Saeedi, district governor of Dasht-e Archi in northern Kunduz province, which shares a porous border with the former Soviet republic.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed denied Russia was giving military support, though he said the group did establish links with Russia about nine months ago.

""Our political office in Qatar held a few low-profile meetings, particularly with Russian ambassadors,"" Mujahed said by phone. ""The talks took place during international conferences in countries outside Russia.""

Still, former Taliban commander Khan Mohammad Cherik, who recently joined the government's peace process with 200 of his soldiers, said Russia was providing military and financial help. ""Russian weapons were brought to us through many channels in the last one-to-two years,"" he said by phone.

While there is no proof of weapons being provided, ""we have seen Russian activity vis-à-vis the Taliban,'' Mattis said at a briefing in London on March 31. ""What they're up to there in light of their other activities gives us concern.'

Around 13,000 U.S. and NATO troops are in Afghanistan and the top U.S. commander is pushing for several thousand more. The U.S. estimates that only 57 percent of Afghanistan is under government control, a 15 percent decrease since November 2015.

Russia, which until 2015 had offered support to U.S.-led forces fighting the Taliban by letting military equipment transit its territory, has ""practically cut itself off from the coalition,'' said Omar Nessar, head of the Moscow-based Center for Contemporary Afghan Studies.

Further challenging American leadership, Russia invited China, India, Pakistan and Iran, plus five ex-Soviet Central Asian states, the U.S. and Afghanistan to the April 14 meeting which it says can pave the way for talks between the Taliban and Afghan government. Moscow has said it is willing to host such a meeting.

The risk is Russia's support of the Taliban ""will backfire and help embolden extremist groups whose ultimate objective is to subjugate Afghanistan and then pose a risk to neighboring countries,'' said Omar Samad, a former Afghan ambassador to Canada and France. ""Russia is misjudging the situation by bypassing Kabul and trying to sideline Washington.""",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Moscow', 'United States', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Afghanistan', 'Ukraine', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Libya', 'Italy', 'Kunduz Province', 'London', 'Tajikistan', 'Qatar', 'Kabul', 'Pakistan', 'Iran']",Russia Opens New Front in Rivalry With U.S. With Taliban Support,https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-10/russia-opens-new-front-in-rivalry-with-u-s-with-taliban-support,None,
11401042,2017-03-31,"Russia said it supports the Taliban's demand for foreign troops to leave Afghanistan as it criticized agreements that allow U.S. and NATO forces to remain for the long term in the war-torn country.

""Of course it's justified"" for the Taliban to oppose the foreign military presence, President Vladimir Putin's special envoy for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said in an interview in Moscow. ""Who's in favor? Name me one neighboring state that supports it.""

Russia and the U.S. are increasingly at odds over Afghanistan. Officials in Moscow disclosed at the end of last year that they've been having contacts with the fundamentalist Islamic movement that ruled the country from 1996 to 2001, when it was overthrown in a U.S.-led invasion to destroy terrorist training camps run by Osama Bin Laden. U.S. generals say Russia may be supplying weapons to the Taliban, which is waging an expanding insurgency against the pro-Western Afghan government. Moscow denies the allegation.

Around 13,000 U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops are currently in Afghanistan, and the top U.S. commander is pushing for several thousand more to help reverse the course of the war. The U.S. estimates that only 57 percent of Afghanistan is under government control, a 15 percent decrease since November 2015.

The foreign forces are in Afghanistan as part of security accords signed under President Ashraf Ghani a day after he took office in September 2014. They allow for U.S. and NATO troops to stay through the end of 2024 and beyond, mending a relationship that had soured under his predecessor Hamid Karzai.

The tensions over Afghanistan come as Russia's hopes for better ties with new U.S. President Donald Trump's administration fade amid continuing disputes over alleged Kremlin interference in last year's election campaign. The two powers are also competing in Syria and Libya as Russia seeks to restore its influence in the Middle East.

Kabulov accused the U.S. of sabotaging Russian efforts to help end the Afghan war by boycotting a Moscow meeting planned for mid-April between Afghanistan and outside powers. Russia, where memories remain fresh of the Soviet Union's Afghanistan experience 28 years after the Red Army's humiliating withdrawal in 1989, says it's offering to host peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.

Kabulov blamed the U.S. decision on a fit of pique that Russia is taking the lead, and suggested that the military establishment in Washington is undermining Trump's campaign pledge to cooperate with Russia in fighting terrorism. ""The U.S. won't tell us and others what to do in Afghanistan,"" he said.

While some Taliban elements are in a tactical alliance with Islamic State, the ""bulk"" of the movement and its leadership is determined to fight the terrorist group, the Russian diplomat said. This means the Taliban has ""common interests"" with Russia, said Kabulov.

""They have given up global jihad and have become a national force,"" he said.

The Soviet Union lost 15,000 soldiers during a disastrous 10-year occupation of Afghanistan. Russia criticizes the U.S.-led military campaign there as a total failure, though Kabulov warned in January that an immediate withdrawal of American troops would lead to the ""collapse"" of the Afghan state.

Russia's acting partly because it wants to counter the threat from Islamic State as the jihadists gain ground in Afghanistan amid the widening conflict, said Petr Topychkanov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. But it also ""views American bases in Afghanistan as a threat to its interests"" and is maneuvering to maximize its influence by keeping channels of communication with all sides, he said.

11401043,2017-03-17,"Russian rulers have long been content to accept fear and awe in lieu of respect and admiration, and by that standard, Putin shone in 2016. This year that is proving a tougher gig to keep up, as he prepares for what might be his last presidential election in 2018.

Last year, Putin's boldness, combined with a bit of luck, paid off: The victories in Syria, the successful destabilization of Ukraine, the swelling support for populists in Western nations. Even the Russian economy provided some hopeful signs with something of an agricultural boom and the de-facto end of negative growth (economic output shrank just 0.2 percent last year). But the path to greatness Putin has chosen is a tough one: It's easier to make headlines than to turn them into tangible, long- or even medium-tern advantages.

Russia's efforts to cultivate an opposition to the continent's centrist elites look likely to backfire. The wise men at the Kremlin and the Russian foreign ministry never entertained much hope that Geert Wilders would become Dutch prime minister and veto a sanctions extension, or that National Front leader Marine Le Pen would win and dismantle the European Union altogether. French republican candidate Francois Fillon represented a far more solid hope -- an alternative to Germany's determination to treat Russia as an adversary. Fillon, however, has been tripped up by a satirical newspaper that discovered he had been paying his wife a parliamentary aide's salary; Putin has always underestimated the power of a free press, perhaps because he has limited experience with one.

In the upcoming German election, no serious party or candidate can be counted on to advance Putin's goals: Social Democrat Martin Schulz is no more pro-Kremlin than Chancellor Angela Merkel. So here in Germany, Russian interference has been invisible so far, and it will likely stay that way through election season.

Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. initially looked like a major success for Putin, especially if one believes the stories of Trump's and his associates' close ties to Russia. But even if Trump had planned to make any peace offerings to Putin, he has been hemmed in by a major anti-Russian campaign run by the media and his political rivals. And for anyone who still thinks Trump is a Russian puppet, on Thursday, the U.S. State Department, run by supposedly pro-Russian former oil executive Rex Tillerson, put out a statement strongly condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea timed to coincide with the annexation's third anniversary.

Trump is nevertheless better for Putin than Clinton would have been. He's disengaged from Europe, and Merkel's visit to Washington on Friday is unlikely to fix what started off as a dysfunctional relationship. His focus is clearly domestic, and he's disinclined and probably ill-equipped to meddle in areas where Russian interests are strong, such as Ukraine, the Balkans and Libya. In Syria, his interest is limited to defeating the Islamic State -- something that is also in the Russian interest.

Under Trump, the U.S. has stepped up involvement in Syria. Recent U.S. strikes helped Assad and Russia retake Palmyra from ISIS fighters. All of this moves Russia closer toward its goal of securing Assad's position in any future settlement, but it's not ideal. Putin would have preferred to resolve the Syrian crisis in partnership with Turkey, leading to a de-facto division of spheres of influence between the two countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, proved a less than reliable partner because of his overweening interest in destroying Kurdish separatists, and Russia has been forced to accept a kind of unspoken situational alliance with the U.S. to keep him in check. This complicates the final deal for Putin; in any case, the deal is nowhere in sight at this point despite Russian and Turkish diplomatic efforts.

In the Balkans and in Libya, Russia has made its interests known, but it has been careful not to make any Crimea-style surprise moves; victory wouldn't be certain and a defeat could be catastrophic for Putin's carefully constructed reputation as an international force. Last year's alleged failed coup in Montenegro -- probably a freelance effort by Russian nationalists Putin tolerates rather than fully backs -- is a good reason for caution. Moscow also hesitates to go all in for Libya's General Khalifa Haftar: He may turn out to be too weak, requiring a costlier effort than Putin can afford, both politically and militarily.

Ukraine, where Russia's immediate interests are stronger than in the Middle East, continues its self-destructive trajectory. President Petro Poroshenko recently decided to back a blockade of eastern Ukraine's separatist regions, which his government previously said could result in heavy economic losses for the nation. The reason Poroshenko flip-flopped is that the blockade was backed by fiercely anti-Russian war veterans -- a force Poroshenko himself has unleashed and one he now fears.

It's possible that, by tightening his stranglehold on Ukraine, Putin isn't just turning it into a lost cause for the West -- he's also encouraging violent forms of nationalism whose rise is more dangerous to Russia than Poroshenko's incompetence and corruption. This year, Ukraine is likely to drift further away from Russia, not get closer to it.

Economically, too, there is not much relief on the horizon for Russia. A joint attempt with Saudi Arabia and other oil exporters to talk up oil prices by promising big production cuts is fizzling. If current prices -- below $50 per barrel -- hold, the Russian budget won't collapse, but there will be no growth bonus, either. Gross domestic product is expected to increase by about 1 percent -- a slower growth than in other emerging markets or even the EU, and not enough to back any kind of geopolitical expansion beyond the existing relatively cheap projects.

Putin can try to move fast and unpredictably in a new shock-and-awe campaign. But he can't count on strong allies or on a buoyant economy, and his instinct appears to be to exercise caution for now. That's a sure way to disappear from the headlines he has counted on to bolster his image.

11401059,2017-10-19,"Summit discussion will cover North Korea, trade and migration

Once heralded as a crucial moment in Britain's march out of the European Union, a meeting of the bloc's leaders this week will instead focus on other simmering crises amid stalled Brexit negotiations.

EU chiefs meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday are set summarily to declare that there has been insufficient progress in separation talks with the U.K. to allow parallel trade negotiations to begin. That gives the government chiefs latitude to discuss other priorities, ranging from U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to ditch the Iran nuclear accord to the threat posed by North Korea.

Here are some highlights of what EU leaders will discuss:

Leaders plan to vent frustration over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on domestic political opponents while avoiding any policy changes, such as formally suspending the country's 12-year-long negotiations on joining the bloc. This reveals the extent to which the status quo suits the 28-nation EU, with the membership talks already stalled and the bloc keen for Erdogan to uphold a 2016 agreement stemming an influx of Middle Eastern refugees. Still, while no decisions are expected to be taken at the summit, EU diplomats foresee some consensus to be formed around likely future actions regarding accession funds given to Turkey.

The EU government chiefs will reiterate a determination to uphold the Iranian nuclear agreement after Trump last week threatened to walk away from the deal (which took 12 years of diplomacy to reach) and asked Congress to toughen the terms within 60 days. Europe is pinning its hopes on lawmakers in Washington to preserve the 2015 pact, arguing that Iran is in full compliance and that the deal is more important than ever for global security as North Korean pursues nuclear-weapons tests.

New French President Emmanuel Macron will take a page out of France's old EU handbook when he warns the bloc against rushing into more free-trade deals, which other European governments believe are key to countering Trump's protectionist tilt. Macron's timing, as head of a top European agricultural producer, isn't coincidental: EU trade negotiators are seeking to strike a market-opening accord by year-end with the Mercosur group of Latin American nations (after two decades of on-and-off deliberations) and are gearing up to start talks with Australia and New Zealand. The other non-coincidence: These pacts promise to expose French farmers to sharper import competition. Still, Macron's decision to add trade to the summit's agenda gives the leaders an opportunity for a broader discussion about the bloc's strategy, especially in light of a populist revolt that almost scuttled a landmark agreement with Canada.

EU countries including France and Germany are leading a push for a long-sought breakthrough over a controversial 2016 proposal, opposed by eastern members, to revamp European asylum rules by establishing a system for relocating refugees across the bloc when a gateway country is overwhelmed by arrivals. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told lawmakers in Rome on Wednesday that he would continue his country's ""battle"" at the summit for ""a greater commitment"" from other member states to manage the flow of migrants from across the Mediterranean. He said he would press for more resources and a stronger presence of humanitarian organizations in Libya, Italy's former colony.

While not formally on the summit's agenda, leaders will have half an eye on events in Catalonia, with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy committed to revoking the region's devolved powers unless the separatist leaders back down by 10 a.m. Thursday. Should Spanish law-enforcement operations spiral out of control as they did during the illegal referendum on Oct. 1, Rajoy's colleagues would find themselves in the awkward position of having to wade into domestic politics.

Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo may seek support from her counterparts for a plan by the European Commission to make the Nord Stream 2 Russian natural-gas link project compliant with EU energy law. As member states remain deadlocked over a commission proposal to get a mandate for negotiations with Russia, the EU regulatory arm is said to be drafting a law that would make all new gas pipelines from third countries subject to the bloc's market-opening rules. Such a law would need backing from national governments and the European Parliament to enter into force.

Over breakfast on Friday, EU leaders will look at their road map for the bloc over the next two years, including closer defense cooperation and deeper euro-area integration. In a letter on Tuesday, European Council President Donald Tusk mapped out how the EU should move ahead in key areas and called for leaders to be more actively involved. EU diplomats said the letter was well-received by national capitals.

In case the bloc's leaders don't have enough on their mind already to give them a headache, toxic smoke may do. The spanking-new Europa Building, which serves as the seat of the European Council and cost 321 million euros, has been evacuated twice in the past week after an unspecified ""technical issue"" in its ventilation systems produced noxious fumes, sending staff members to hospital. The venue of the summit was moved to the old Justus Lipsius building next door, sparing leaders the prospect of a debate about global security threats being overshadowed by a local security alarm.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['North Korea', 'Iran', 'Brussels', 'France', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Turkey', 'United Kingdom', 'Catalonia', 'Rome', 'Russia', 'New Zealand', 'Libya', 'Italy']",Brexit Isn't The Biggest Talking Point at the EU Summit,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-18/brexit-loses-top-spot-at-eu-summit-as-turkey-iran-crises-brew,None,
11401060,2017-09-05,"Two years ago, Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy photographed lying face down on a beach near the Turkish resort of Bodrum, stirred the conscience of many Europeans. That moment of guilt and shame already seems past. We've barely noticed that since Kurdi's death at least 8,500 people, many of them unescorted children, have died or disappeared while attempting to cross the Mediterranean, according to the United Nations' refugee agency.

The Italian government has started to work with the Libyan coast guard as well as tribes in southern Libya to block the flow of migrants and refugees. Italy's neighbors -- France, Switzerland and Austria -- in turn have beefed up border security, with police sending migrants back to Italy. The number of refugees arriving in Europe has dramatically decreased this summer.

QuickTake Europe's Refugees

Still, more than 120,000 people have come to Europe by sea this year, a great majority of them making the perilous journey from Libya to Italy. And the desperation that drives the denizens of failing or failed states, as well as victims of banditry and interminable civil wars, into inflatable vessels and ramshackle fishing boats is unlikely to abate anytime soon.

The other reality also stares us in the face: Too much migration has already taken place for the ultra-nationalist fantasy of ethnically and culturally homogenous populations to be realized. Yet many demagogic tendencies across Europe threaten to make the continent relive its awful past of sectarian hatred. Hating and beggaring thy neighbor for the sake of short-term political gains is no longer just confined to the usual suspects, such as Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

An admirer of Donald Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico, Orban claims that ""every single migrant poses a public security and terror risk."" Never mind that, as the anti-Orban activist group Two-Tailed Dog points out in a poster, ""the average Hungarian is more likely to see a UFO than a refugee in his lifetime."" Or that Hungary, like most European countries with declining populations, needs migrants. Orban's views are broadly supported by the governments of Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

Even the most prosperous parts of Europe are now vulnerable to such pathologies. Last week Sylvi Listhaug, Norway's immigration minister from the populist Progress Party, travelled to one of Stockholm's most violent suburbs to highlight Sweden's problems with immigration. Echoing Donald Trump's contention about London, she alleged that there are 60 ""no-go zones"" in Sweden.

The claim, an extraordinary breach of diplomatic protocol, was dismissed as ""complete nonsense"" by Sweden's immigration minister. But the audience for Listhaug's fake news was back home, where elections are due in less than two weeks. In Italy, too, far-right opposition parties are stoking public sentiments against migrants. In elections due next year in the euro zone's third-largest economy, they could enfeeble the pro-EU ruling Democratic Party.

Certainly, politicians can squeeze much political mileage from vulnerable refugees. This is due to a psycho-social dynamic generated by the strangers in our midst -- both real and imagined. Migrants, embodying the vast and opaque forces of globalization, remind many in Europe today of their own fragile socio-economic position. They come to be feared irrationally for further suppressing long stagnant wages and salaries, and lengthening the queues at employment centers, schools and hospitals.

Few politicians, it seems, can resist the temptation to exploit the profound anxieties many people have about their precarious status in the world. It is so much easier to divert public anger over political dysfunction, corruption and incompetence against migrants than to enact positive change.

But there are also more hopeful trends, and nowhere more so than in Europe's leading country. Contrary to all expectations, refugees have not featured much in Germany's election campaign. This is largely because Germany is far less open to immigration than it was in 2015, when Angela Merkel opened the country's borders to nearly one million refugees. Importantly, it is also true that German authorities have moved to integrate the newcomers, acknowledging that they are fated to co-exist with German citizens.

Most are enrolled in language classes. Some have found jobs. More importantly, neither Merkel nor her main opposition (and present coalition partner), the Social Democrats, has sought to exploit stray acts of criminality by refugees. Rather, Merkel has pragmatically claimed that there are bound to be some criminals among a large population of refugees.

Facing down her bitter far-right opponents in Germany, Merkel is now set to become a fourth-term chancellor. This is evidence that even mass immigration can be managed if there is sufficient political will -- or, at least the will to not act cynically. There should be no doubt about the alternative: a relentless mainstreaming of hateful rhetoric, with the kind of toxic consequences we have already witnessed in Europe's savage 20th century history.

11401061,2017-07-18,"If it looks as though Europe is clutching at straws to stop hundreds, sometimes thousands, of migrants from crossing the Mediterranean into Italy every day, that's exactly what's happening. On Monday, the European Union's foreign ministers approved restrictions on the supply of inflatable boats and outboard motors to Libya.

QuickTake Europe's Refugee Crisis

The boats that bring the migrants, mostly Africans these days, have long been a target of European efforts to dismantle the human-trafficking networks that control the Libya-Italy route. According to a U.K. parliamentary report, Operation Sophia, the joint European naval operation that began in 2015, had destroyed 452 boats by mid-June. These were larger, mainly wooden boats that could carry up to 500 people and offered the smugglers the greatest profit margins. Removing them from the Mediterranean has made the migrant crossings riskier. As a European Commission communication pointed out in January, the smugglers' ""business model"" has changed:

They increasingly place irregular migrants and refugees on cheap and completely unseaworthy inflatable dinghies that have no prospect of ever reaching the Italian shores, assuming they will be picked up near or within Libyan territorial waters. The fact that such dinghies now account for 70 percent of all boats leaving the Libyan coast contributes to making journeys increasingly dangerous and to the rise in the number of deaths at sea.

What the focus on destroying boats hasn't changed are the migrant arrival numbers. On July 14, 5,122 people came, close to the record of 5,504 set on Aug. 31, 2016. But the EU stubbornly keeps after the boats, this time rubber ones.

A Sophia report from December, 2015, published by WikiLeaks three months later, noted:

Reports of rubber boast being imported from China and transhipped in Malta and Turkey are supported by a recent interception by Maltese customs of 20 packaged rubber boats in a container destined for Misratah, Libya. As there are no legal grounds for holding such shipments, it was released for delivery to the destination.

That cargo would now be seized. But Europe has little control over the Chinese boat trade.

China has a lively inflatable boat industry with some 180 builders. Some two-thirds of rubber boats imported to Europe come from China. The manufacturers and sellers there know how their products are often used. On Alibaba, the biggest Chinese online market, the dinghies are marketed as ""refugee boats.""

It's easy to predict the consequences of the export restrictions. Dinghy shipments to Libya will no longer go through Malta, but rather through Turkey and North Africa. The EU sanctions have a loophole for fishermen, which will be exploited. If a shortage is created, smugglers will have to pay more for the vessels, so they'll cram even more migrants into them or to reuse the boats instead of dumping them at sea. This may result in more deaths; so far this year, 2,174 people drowned or went missing trying to make the crossing, compared with 2,951 by this point of the year in 2016.

In May, the EU asked China to help stop the shipments. But the producing country can't reasonably be expected to stop a large homegrown industry from shipping rubber boats to Turkey or Morocco.

The ugly reality of the current migrant crisis is that Europe can do little to stop the smuggling. The boat restrictions and EU participation in the training of the Libyan coast guard are the hopeless flailings of a bloc trapped by the consequences of the 2011 North Atlantic Treaty Organization military operation, which accelerated regime change in Libya but left it lawless and the coast practically unpoliced. In the same document that imposed the rubber boat restrictions, the EU reiterated ""its firm support"" for the internationally recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj, which controls little in Libya beyond the capital city of Tripoli.

This is a losing game. There's no point in repeating the bromide that the Libyan conflict cannot be resolved by force. Force is exactly what's likely to resolve it, when the strongest rebel group manages to consolidate the country or when it splits up the way Somalia did. Apart from pinpointing the strongest rebels and backing them militarily -- an unpalatable option to democracy-supporting Europeans -- the only solution to human trafficking out of Libya would be to land an expeditionary force to pursue the smugglers. Since the EU's joint military capability is modest, this should be an operation for NATO, which helped create the original mess and should help clean it up.

If that ever happens, Chinese rubber boat sales will drop a little -- but then the boat-building companies weren't started with African migrants in mind. They'll just have to go back to courting clients who want dinghies because they like to go fishing.

A statement said the measure will also apply to boats and motors transiting through the EU, but not to fishermen or others with legitimate need for them.

The foreign ministers also agreed to extend a border aid mission in Libya through the end of 2018 that helps Libyan security forces, notably in the lawless south.

11401063,2017-07-05,"Europe is in the midst of its second migration crisis since 2015. This one is smaller than the last, but harder to resolve.

According to the UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, 84,832 undocumented migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, higher for every month except January.

This is a very different problem, however, than the one Europe faced in 2015. Back then, most of the newcomers who flooded the continent via the so-called eastern Mediterranean or Balkan route -- through Turkey, Greece, former Yugoslavia, Hungary and on to Germany and Scandinavia -- were genuine refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. This year, Nigerians are the biggest group of people arriving in Italy via the central Mediterranean route, mainly from Libya; they are followed by Bangladeshis, Guineans, Ivorians, Gambians, Senegalese and Moroccans. These countries are not war-torn like Syria, and the people who flee them mainly do so for economic reasons.

QuickTake Europe's Refugee Crisis

Because this is no mass refugee exodus but a sum of thinner flows from poor countries, human trafficking plays a much bigger role in the most recent migration wave than it did in the last one. According to the International Organization for Migration, which surveys the migrants, 79 percent of those who used the central Mediterranean route this year reported that they had been subjected to trafficking and exploitative practices: held against their will, forced to work without pay, beaten or tortured.

Another important distinction is that while Germany's decision to welcome the refugees in the previous crisis relieved the tension on the countries along the Balkan route (and increased it in Germany, which proved capable of handling it), this year's arrivals are bottled up in Italy. Countries along its borders have been careful to keep out as many migrants as they possibly can. Austria decided to send soldiers and armored personnel carriers to the Italian border. Switzerland is strengthening the police presence at crossings. Migrants have been clashing with Italian police in Ventimiglia on the French border: Neither France nor the Italian town wants them.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel ultimately stopped the previous crisis in March, 2016 by spearheading the European Union's deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised to accept migrants if Europe turned them back. Though the EU hasn't quite kept its end of the bargain -- it has sent the promised monetary aid but not granted Turks visa-free travel, which depended on certain conditions being met by Ankara -- the deal has largely held. Turkey has housed almost 3 million Syrian refugees, who are largely staying put. Besides, countries along the Balkan route have fortified their borders and made it clear they would make life difficult for migrants. There are no such remedies available for the current crisis.

The central Mediterranean route is direct -- there are no other countries to cross between Libya and Italy, just a stormy, often deadly sea. There is also no way to strike a Turkey-style deal. Since Muammar Gaddafi was killed, Libya has had a weak democratically elected government that doesn't control much of the country. General Khalifa Haftar, on the verge of gaining full control of Benghazi, Libya's second city, after a three-year battle, is threatening to attack the capital, Tripoli, by the end of the year. But even if Europeans wanted to do a deal with Haftar -- and they don't, at least not openly -- he couldn't promise them anything, either.

Besides, the Italian government is too weak to intervene more heavily in Libya, which was an Italian colony for most of the first half of the 20th century. The next election, which should take place early next year, threatens to unseat the cabinet led by the center-left Democratic Party in favor of the populist Five Star Movement or the resurgent right, which made gains in recent local elections. Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni is no Merkel, and it's hard to expect him to move as effectively as she did in 2016 to stave off her own political demise.

There are almost 400,000 identified migrants in Libya, and probably many more unidentified ones. Unlike the ones settled in refugee camps in Turkey, these people are on the move, actively seeking opportunities to cross into Europe and preyed upon by traffickers.

It's clear that the migrant resettlement scheme agreed by the bloc in September, 2015, is not not working -- only 23,503 people have been relocated so far, most of them from Greece. Eastern European nations have barely taken any, and wealthier Western European ones are a long way from meeting their quotas. Additional resources for Frontex, the European border agency, have been useful -- the agency saves thousands of migrants who otherwise would have drowned and arrests hundreds of suspected traffickers -- but there's no way to seal the sea border completely. And though the EU allows Italy to run a large budget deficit and disburses additional funds to the country so it could better handle the migrant inflows -- the bloc announced another 35 million euro ($40 million) allocation Tuesday -- money alone cannot solve Italy's migration-related problems, including political ones.

The EU's newly issued action plan to support Italy is largely a set of palliative measures. The inflows via the central Mediterranean route can't be cut while Libya is incapable of reaching and implementing any deal to keep the migrants as Turkey has done. If the European Union had a joint military force, the crisis would probably justify a deployment -- and, judging by the current balance of forces, an intervention on Haftar's side. But not even the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which most EU countries are members, will consider anything of the kind.

Unlike in 2015, refugees are not entering Europe by their millions. But the current crisis is also a humanitarian disaster and has reached more an impasse. The Italian government cannot do much to help itself. The Libyan mess is holding it hostage.

OPEC's crude production rose to the highest this year in June as member nations exempt from output curbs pumped more.

Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries boosted their output by 260,000 barrels a day compared with May, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data. Half of the increase came from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from making cuts under the deal agreed between OPEC and its allies.

OPEC began production cuts in January to reduce swollen global inventories and bolster the price of oil, which is still stuck at half its 2014 level. In May, OPEC and its partners, including Russia, extended their agreement for a further nine months through March 2018 because the oil market had failed to rebalance.

Resurgent production in Libya and Nigeria is threatening to neutralize the cuts made by the rest of the group. Libya's output is currently at a four-year high, back above the 1 million-barrel-a-day mark, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. In Nigeria, the return of Forcados crude offset declines elsewhere as force majeure was declared on Bonny Light in June.

OPEC's biggest producer Saudi Arabia increased output by 90,000 barrels a day in June, while Angola and the United Arab Emirates both lifted production by 40,000 barrels a day from May, the survey showed.

Over the first half of the year, the 11 OPEC members bound by the output curbs were fully compliant with their pledges, the survey showed. Counting Nigeria and Libya, total OPEC output remained about 390,000 barrels a day above the target set out in the Nov. 30 production agreement, putting the group only about 71 percent of the way toward its goal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Equatorial Guinea joined OPEC at its meeting in May, boosting the group's membership to 14.

11401065,2017-06-07,"Rome (AP) -- Two wrecks of migrant ships in the Mediterranean have claimed as many as 245 lives, including those of at least five children, according to survivor accounts given to U.N. agencies and authorities in Sicily, where dozens of rescued migrants were taken.

Survivors of one wreck, some of them hospitalized in Pozzallo, Sicily, where they were being treated for hypothermia and exhaustion, told authorities who interviewed them that their traffickers had crammed some 130-140 people, apparently all from central African countries, into a motorized rubber dinghy designed to hold at most 20 people.

The dinghy started deflating on one end, the passengers quickly shifted their positions in the boat, and the craft tipped over, authorities said, based on numerous survivors' descriptions.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity since the shipwreck is being investigated.

The dinghy wasn't equipped with any distress signaling equipment. The 52 survivors clung for hours to the wreckage of the dinghy until they were spotted by a patrol plane and rescued by a Danish cargo ship, which was dispatched to their aid by the Italian Coast Guard.

One survivor was a Nigerian woman, whose 5-month-old baby died. The infant's corpse was one of the few bodies so far recovered, authorities said.

""I lost my baby, she drowned, but God didn't allow me to die,"" the woman, who asked to be identified only by her initials, S.J., told The Associated Press in an interview outside the migrant processing center in Pozzallo.

The 22-year-old, from Benin City, in Nigeria, reflected on her journey that begin in March 2016 in her homeland and offered these words for other Nigerians.

""I want to tell my fellow people...to not come, it's not easy to come here ... the sea is not friendly, many things happen.""

Even at the moment that the cargo ship was about to pluck the survivors to safety, the woman recalled, some just couldn't hold on any longer. ""Even as they were rescued, one person died, a baby died.""

In the end, she said, 82 people perished and 52 survived.

Police in Sicily said in a statement that many of the survivors recounted that among those who drowned was one of the smugglers who had been steering the boat.

""They couldn't even remember who saved them. They were completely shocked and traumatized,"" said Carlotta Sami, Rome-based spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency.

Meanwhile, at its Geneva headquarters, the refugee agency said that one of its partner agencies, the International Medical Corps, reported a shipwreck on Sunday off the Libyan coast in which 163 people are missing and feared dead. The U.N. agency said one woman and six men were rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard.

That boat was intercepted by the Libyan coast guard, said the UNHRC's Sami, who had no other details.

Many of those who brave the risky central Mediterranean route between Libya and Italy are migrants from Africa seeking to flee from conflicts, political persecution at home or to find better economic opportunities in Europe.

Overall, UNHCR said Tuesday that more than 1,300 people have disappeared and are believed to have died this year while crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa to Italy.

The International Organization for Migration, in separate remarks, gave a lower estimate of the total number of migrant lives lost -- 190 -- in the two shipwrecks. It estimated about 80 people died from the sinking of the dinghy off Italy, and at least 113 following the shipwreck off the coast near Az Zawiyah, Libya.

Since Friday, some 6,612 people were saved in a dozen operations and brought to Italy.

Afterwinter storms and cold sea temperatures, IOM spokesman Joel Millman, ""there is normally pent-up demand. The summer tends to be very, very busy because sea conditions are better.""

In Spain on Tuesday, officials said about 300 migrants tried to scramble across the 6-meter (20-foot) border fence separating Spain's North African enclave of Melilla from Morocco, with many throwing stones and other objects at police.

Melilla's Interior Ministry said most of the migrants were pushed back by Spanish and Moroccan police, but about 100 managed to enter the city. It said three officers and three migrants were treated for injuries.

Many of the thousands of economic migrants or refugees rescued at sea have told authorities they spent months in inhumane detention facilities in Libya, often suffering torture, sexual abuse or labor exploitation, before the smugglers sent them out to sea.

A Rome-based IOM spokesman, Flavio Di Giacomo, said in an interview in Tuesday's La Stampa newspaper that there have been recent indications that some migrants have decided to flee the harsh conditions in Libya to return to their homelands, renouncing their dream of reaching Europe and safety, although ""the majority take the risk of the sea.""

And that voyage is getting ever riskier. Sami told The Associated Press in an interview that the smugglers no longer provide satellite phones so the migrants can call for help, ""nor engines or even fuel.""

""They are completely adrift"" and at the mercy of sea, Sami said.

The Nigerian survivor told the AP their smugglers gave them neither compass nor satellite phone.

In some cases, migrants have recounted that their smugglers removed the dinghy's motor and sped off in another dinghy after traveling a few miles out from Libya.

The IOM said 41,196 migrants have arrived in Italy this year, up from around 31,000 in the same period last year. Some 1,222 have died.

The figure for the Mediterranean as a whole, including Greece, Cyprus and Spain, was 49,310 as of Sunday. For the same period last year, the total number of sea arrivals was far higher -- 187,569. That was because some 155,000 arrived in Greece from Turkey, compared with only 5,555 this year.

Rosneft PJSC's commitment to pay in advance for crude oil from the Kurdish region of Iraq is about $1 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to named as the supply deal is private.

The Russian state-run producer's trading arm will buy Kurdish oil from now until 2019, Rosneft said in February, without specifying how much crude it would take. At $1 billion, Rosneft would account for about a third of the prepayment deals the Kurdish Regional Government negotiated with oil traders.

Rosneft's press service didn't comment on the payment size when contacted by phone. An adviser to the KRG's Natural Resources Minister Ashti Hawrami didn't immediately respond to a call and email seeking comment.

The KRG is selling oil in advance to help finance government spending, including the military campaign against Islamic State, during a period of relatively low oil prices. For Rosneft, the deal brings a guaranteed flow of crude into its expanding trading business and is another example of its expansion into the Middle East following deals in Libya and Egypt.

Under the deal with the KRG, Rosneft will receive its first 600,000-barrel cargo this week at Trieste, Italy, from where the crude will be transported by pipeline to its minority-owned refineries in Germany for processing, according to an email from Rosneft. Kurdish crude suits the company's refining needs in both Germany and India, said Rosneft, which could potentially source more oil from the region.

Rosneft owns 24 percent of MiRO and 25 percent of BayernOil following the restructuring of a joint venture with BP Plc. The company is also in the process of acquiring a 49 percent stake in the Vadinar refinery in India from Essar Oil.

Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin said in February that the company will be ""developing new markets worldwide for Kurdish crude oil."" Rosneft hasn't previously worked with the KRG, which in recent years has struggled to maintain payments to international producers shipping oil from the region.

Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, has long participated in prepayment deals with trading houses for its own output. The company's 25-year deal to supply oil to China National Petroleum Corp. has also yielded billions of dollars of advance payments.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Iraq', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Trieste', 'Libya', 'India', 'Egypt']",Rosneft Said to Prepay About $1 Billion for Kurdistan Oil,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-06/rosneft-said-to-prepay-about-1-billion-for-iraqi-kurdistan-oil,None,
11401067,2017-03-24,"A decade after its first big oil find, East Africa's emergence as a crude exporter has been hindered by security and cost concerns that left the region building two pipelines instead of one.

Uganda and Kenya are developing two new basins and originally agreed to build one line to connect the landlocked discoveries to the coast. That changed last year, when Uganda chose a more southerly 1,400-kilometer (870-mile) route through Tanzania, citing lower transit prices. Kenya will go it alone with an 865-kilometer line to a port on the Indian Ocean.

Two pipelines will test the economics of the developments. Both projects probably need an oil price of $50 to $55 a barrel to break even, while lower costs or taxes may be required to justify a final investment decision in Uganda, according to BMO Capital Markets. The Tanzanian route will get some funding help from France's Total SA, which owns a stake in the Uganda reserves, but it still hasn't secured the financing it needs. Further north, Kenya's explorers are under pressure to improve the project's viability by finding more resources.

""The Kenyan pipeline seemed economically viable when Ugandan oil was going to flow through it,"" said Jacques Nel, an economist at NKC African Economics. With separate lines each carrying less oil than planned and global prices remaining weak, the economics ""will continue to cast a shadow over the development of the sector,"" he said.

While Africa produces more than 8.4 million barrels of crude daily from major exporters like Libya and Algeria in the north and Nigeria and Angola in the west, eastern countries weren't on the world oil map. That changed in 2006, when Tullow Oil Plc found what may be as much as 1.7 billion barrels of recoverable reserves in landlocked Uganda's Lake Albert region.

In 2012, Tullow made another find in Kenya's South Lokichar basin that may contain 750 million barrels. Combined, Kenya and Uganda may be able to produce about 400,000 barrels a day once production begins.

That could catapult Uganda, which will account for about two-thirds of the output, to upper-middle income status by 2040 as economic growth rebounds to as much as 10 percent from 4.6 percent in the last fiscal year, according to the World Bank. Kenya's government would generate revenue of $650 million a year in the late-2020s, even with crude at just $45 a barrel, said KCSPOG, a non-governmental organization.

Brent oil traded at $50.63 a barrel at 12:14 p.m. Singapore time. The global benchmark has dropped about 11 percent this year.

Originally, the two countries agreed to share a pipeline running through Kenya's arid Lokichar basin to the coastal town of Lamu. But parts of the route have been prone to attacks by bandits and cattle rustlers. It's also is close to Somalia, where Islamist al-Shabaab militants have waged an insurgency against the government for the past decade, as well as carrying out raids inside Kenya.

Safety was a concern for Paris-based Total, which in January increased its holding in the Lake Albert site. The French company agreed to help finance part of an alternative route through Tanzania that may cost about $4 billion.

Uganda government officials said the switch was a business decision. The Kenyan route would have been ""very costly,"" with a tariff of $15.90 a barrel, compared with $12.20 for the Tanzanian pipeline, according to Energy Minister Irene Muloni.

""We took a decision which is good for our country,"" Muloni said in an interview in Kampala, the capital.

Tullow's CEO-designate Paul McDade said last week that Uganda's resources could be developed at a total cost of about $20 a barrel, including capital expenditure on drilling and pipeline construction plus operating costs.

""Along with the offer of better tariffs, Uganda argued that the Tanga pipeline would mean easier land access, better security, and would open up another important trade route,"" said Emma Gordon, an analyst for East Africa at Verisk Maplecroft. ""Currently, the country is heavily reliant on Kenya for its trade.""

Uganda's decision dented Kenya's ambitions to develop a $26 billion regional transport corridor, leaving explorers in the country under pressure to improve the project's viability by boosting resources.

Kenya ""took a hit"" from Uganda's volte-face, said Ahmed Salim, Dubai-based vice president of Teneo Strategy. ""And as much as Total has backed this plan, both the Ugandan and Tanzanian governments have to finance this project and I think that's where things will run into some difficulty.""

Still, both the Ugandan and Kenyan projects have seen positive developments in recent months. Uganda awarded Gulf Interstate Engineering a contract to conduct the front-end engineering study on its pipeline, and Muloni said the project is on a fast-track to ensure first oil is produced in 2020.

The Kenyan government has shortlisted eight companies for a pipeline engineering study, with construction due to start in 2018, according to Andrew Kamau, principal secretary at the ministry of energy.

Tullow, which previously favored the Kenyan export route, will ""focus more physical effort"" in that country, said George Cazenove, a spokesman for the U.K.-based explorer. ""But both countries are critical to Tullow's future.""

Vancouver-based Africa Oil -- a partner of Tullow and Maersk Oil in Kenya -- also announced a discovery in January that brings reserves closer to its 1 billion-barrel goal. The company wants to green-light the project by the end of 2018 and start producing in 2021, he said.

An oil tanker that was scheduled to load crude at Libya's Es Sider port changed its course to a different terminal in the west of the country as clashes in the eastern region keep the main export terminals out of service. Waha Oil Co. halted production due to the conflict.

The tanker Overseas Redwood, originally due to load 630,000 barrels of crude at Es Sider on Thursday, will arrive instead at the port of Zawiya, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public.

Production from Waha Oil. Co., a joint venture between the state oil company National Oil Corp., Hess Corp., Marathon Oil Corp. and ConocoPhillips, is now suspended as key ports have been closed for almost a week, according to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because of a lack of permission to speak to media.

Libya's total crude output remains unchanged at 671,000 barrels a day as increases in production from other companies, including Arabian Gulf Oil Co., have countered the decline from Waha's fields, Jadalla Alaokali, a board member at the NOC said Wednesday.

The Petroleum Facilities Guard, a United Nations-backed force, said Tuesday it took control of oil installations at Es Sider, the country's biggest oil port, and Ras Lanuf, its third-largest, following their capture by a militia group called the Benghazi Defense Brigades earlier this month. The ports had previously been controlled by eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar.

The North African nation has sought to boost crude exports after fighting among rival militias hobbled oil production following the 2011 ouster of dictator Moammar Al Qaddafi. The conflict showed signs of calming in recent months, and oil output rose to about 700,000 barrels a day in February from 260,000 a day in August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's still well below the 1.6 million a day that Libya pumped before Qaddafi's ouster.

Waha Oil has a capacity of more than 300,000 barrels a day, according to the NOC website. Its production dropped by half to 40,000 barrels a day, two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public, said on March 5.

""Output from Waha Oil Co. continues to be reduced and may reach a complete halt within coming hours,"" Jadalla Alaokali, a board member at National Oil Corp., said by phone.

The Petroleum Facilities Guard, a United Nations-backed force, said Tuesday it took control of oil installations at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, the country's largest and third-largest oil ports, following their seizure by the Benghazi Defense Brigades militia in early March. The ports had previously been controlled by eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar.

Libya's total crude output remains stable at 671,000 barrels a day as increases in production from other companies, including Arabian Gulf Oil Co., have countered the decline from Waha's fields, according to Alaokali. ""The ports of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf are on alert and workers are kept to a minimum,"" he said.

Libya has sought to boost crude exports after fighting among rival militias slashed oil production following the 2011 ouster of dictator Moammar Al Qaddafi. The conflict showed signs of calming in recent months, and oil output rose to about 700,000 barrels a day in February from 260,000 a day in August, according to Bloomberg estimates. That's still well below the 1.6 million a day pumped before Qaddafi's ouster.

11401071,2017-01-05,"In their fifth week of training, women hired as flight attendants at Emirates Airline spend a day in Dubai with Pamela Mizzi. A makeup artist from Malta who spent 12 years in the sky herself, Mizzi greets the students in a windowless instruction space about 20 feet across, lined on three sides by mirrors divided into vanities by bright roundels of light, like an old-timey dressing room. Her job is to teach the trainees how Emirates expects them to look.

Female cabin crew, referred to invariably as ""girls,"" are to tie their hair back in tight buns, preferably secured by a scrunchie in Emirates-brand red. For makeup, a seven-step process is recommended, starting with foundation and concealer, then moving on to lipstick, also in preauthorized shades of crimson. At the back of Mizzi's classroom are two display racks of Emirates-approved emollients for ""body shaping,"" ""firming,"" ""wrinkle control,"" and ""luminosity.""

""We have standards in regards to nail care,"" Mizzi says. The same is true for weight. If a crew member looks too heavy, his or her superiors are to report their suspicions to a central fitness and nutrition department. ""And they follow up,"" she says. Little escapes scrutiny. By the time crew members reach Mizzi's classroom, they have moved into Emirates-managed apartments with Emirates-imposed curfews, travel to work in Emirates-branded minibuses, and see Emirates-employed doctors at in-house Emirates clinics.

The airline, which is based in Dubai and owned by its government, has become the world's largest long-haul carrier by never relaxing its grip -- on employees, on airplane manufacturers, or on its own ambitions. Emirates recently configured a plane to seat 615 passengers, a record, and flies the world's most epic nonstop route, an 8,824-mile arc from Dubai to Auckland. Emirates is essentially the only buyer of the largest commercial airliner, the Airbus A380, which it gilds with stand-up cocktail bars and in-flight showers. For every flight departing Dubai, as cabin crew head to their airplanes, the last room they traverse is a hall with mirrors on one side and windows to the tarmac on the other. The space allows workers to inspect themselves for perfection against a backdrop of government-owned taxiways thick with Emirates jets. That's the airline, in one image: glamour and ambition in a framework of absolute control.

Since 1985, Emirates has grown from a two-plane operation at a desert airstrip into a force whose every movement rumbles through global aviation. The airline's growth is inseparable from that of Dubai, with both straining the laws of financial and physical gravity. The company's chairman is Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the uncle of Dubai's absolute monarch. He also runs the airport authority, the aviation regulator, and the city's largest bank, should Emirates ever need a loan. Out in the desert, a half-hour drive from the coast's skyscrapers and malls, the government is building a $32 billion, five-runway megahub precisely to Emirates' specifications. Its ambitions are consonant with its name: Dubai World Central. The project will have a capacity of 220 million passengers per year, four times the number that New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport serves today. Two-thirds of humanity lives within the radius of an eight-hour flight. Among industry veterans, the airline's rise inspires a respectful awe. ""Emirates is unprecedented,"" says Tony Tyler, a former chief executive officer of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific. ""There's never been anything as huge.""

Yet as Emirates dictates new standards of technology, luxury, and range, it's finding that more and more is beyond its mastery. Conceived as a titanic bet on the growth of what development economists call the Global South -- the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and Latin America -- the airline is at risk if those emerging markets don't, in fact, emerge. Emirates in May reported its first-ever annual revenue decline and is cutting some of its plans for growth amid slackening demand from sub-Saharan Africa, Turkey, and Brazil. The slump has industry analysts wondering how Emirates will fill the staggering number of planes it has on order. The company has agreed to buy 50 A380s and 174 Boeing 777s, adding to the 92 and 148, respectively, it currently flies. By comparison, British Airways operates 12 A380s, and American Airlines, Delta, and United have zero.

The bigger threat may lie in the U.S., the world's most lucrative travel market, where Emirates has been expanding aggressively. It flies to 11 cities, including Orlando, Boston, Seattle, and Dallas. Led by Delta, the U.S. Big Three are intensifying a lobbying campaign against Emirates and its smaller Persian Gulf rivals, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, collectively the ME3, seeking to curtail their access to American airports unless ""unfair subsidies"" are eliminated. Their argument, that deep-pocketed foreigners are threatening American jobs by flooding the market with subsidized capacity, was once seen in business circles as a long shot -- but it happens to resonate precisely with President-elect Donald Trump's stated view of the world. Similar efforts are afoot in Europe.

Those challenges may make the world less hospitable than ever to a company whose marketing projects a sunny globalism. With Trump and his ilk ascendant, one Emirates ad sums up a corporate ethos that feels increasingly at odds with the times: ""Tomorrow thinks borders are so yesterday.""

In 1984, Dubai was a backwater, one of the seven city-states that made up the fledgling United Arab Emirates, when its ruler, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum, and his son Mohammed decided to start an airline. With $10 million in seed capital and a couple of jets leased from Pakistan, Emirates was created a year later under the leadership of a pair of British expats, Maurice Flanagan and Tim Clark, initially serving regional destinations before making its first flights to London in 1987.

Born in 1912, Rashid was fond of saying that while his father rode a camel, he drove a luxury Mercedes and his son drove a playboy's Land Rover -- but his great-grandson would be back on a camel unless Dubai, never as oil-rich as neighboring Abu Dhabi, found other sources of income. His vision was to turn the city into an entrepôt for the Middle East, an orderly hub for business and tourism -- like Singapore, but drier (in every sense). Emerging from a rural society with a tiny native population, the face of this city would by necessity be foreign: Bangladeshis to build the skyscrapers, Filipinos to staff the restaurants, and Brits to run the management consulting firms. Wealthy Iranians, Egyptians, Saudis, and Indians would fill the condominiums and buy the yachts, using Dubai as neutral ground on which to play, work, and cut deals. The sheikhdom pioneered a model of the state as highly leveraged private equity firm, developing and owning ports, shopping malls, hotels, and, most important, a top-notch airline to bring the world to its door.

While Emirates is adamant that it never received subsidies after its startup grant, there's no question it's operated in an environment that drives Western airlines mad with envy. For starters, Dubai won the geographic lottery. From a fuel and flight-time perspective, the Persian Gulf is the most efficient place on the planet to connect Europe with Southeast Asia and Australia, and the U.S. with India. Strikes and protests aren't an issue -- unions are banned, and rights to free speech and assembly are severely limited. Corporate and income taxes are nil. And then there are the advantages of being the favored corporation of an absolute ruler whose word is literally law. Unlike Heathrow Airport and Los Angeles International, where the rights of nearby citizens to sleep without jet noise must be respected, Dubai International Airport runs at full speed 24 hours a day, allowing Emirates to optimize connection times for a network that spans from Buenos Aires to Christchurch, New Zealand. Keeping passengers coming back, not short-term cost containment, is the highest value.

""We have never equated our investment into a dollar return,"" Chief Operations Officer Adel Ahmad al-Redha, one of the airline's most senior Emiratis, says over tiny glasses of sweet tea in his office at company headquarters, adjacent to the airport. ""His Highness has always told us, 'Build the right product.' That's the priority."" Sheikh Mohammed, who became Dubai's ruler in 2006, is sometimes referred to by Emirates executives as simply ""the shareholder,"" emphasized with a brief upward glance. The ruling sheikhs are never far away. Partway through an interview with al-Redha, an assistant silently enters to place a yellow Post-it in his field of vision: ""HH meeting at 10 a.m."" A few minutes later, al-Redha excuses himself.

Such proximity to the levers of power has allowed Emirates to play hardball with opponents. In 2010, Canada rebuffed requests from the U.A.E. to allow Emirates and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad more landing rights in Toronto. The U.A.E. raged, abruptly closing its airspace to Canada's defense minister while he was in midflight, which forced a diversion, and evicting Canadian troops from a Dubai base they were using to support combat in Afghanistan. Canadian visitors to the U.A.E. were slapped with visa requirements, including fees of as much as C$1,000 ($754), though the gambit backfired. Then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper told his ministers he wouldn't allow soldiers to be used as a bargaining chip. Emirates' landing rights still haven't been increased.

But almost everywhere else, the airline is flying at astonishing capacity. Nine Emirates A380s land in London every day, along with five in Bangkok and four at JFK. In South Africa, Johannesburg gets four daily 777s, Cape Town three, and Durban one. Daily flights to those three cities by U.S. carriers number one, zero, and zero.

At Emirates headquarters, the wall to the left of Clark's desk is covered by a world map about 8 feet high, its projection shifted a couple of turns from the orientation most Americans are used to. The result is to put the Persian Gulf in the center. ""Lloyd Blankfein has sat in that chair and said, 'I want that map on my wall,'?"" Clark says. (The Goldman Sachs CEO declined to comment.) To the right of Clark's desk is a window with a commanding ninth-floor view of Emirates Terminal 3, a trio of silver, sausage-shaped concourses that collectively make up the world's largest airport terminal.

Clark, 67, has spent more than 30 years at Emirates, taking on the role of president (the company's equivalent of CEO) in 2003. After a peripatetic childhood, he got his start in the airline industry as a check-in agent for long-forgotten British Caledonian Airways. As one of Emirates' first employees, he never experienced the cycles of contraction and retrenchment that have defined the careers of his contemporaries at Western carriers. He's Emirates' intellectual godfather, spokesman-in-chief, and enforcer, prone to gazing out over the airfield with binoculars and upbraiding subordinates for lapses. One executive tells of an occasion, years ago, when he was excitedly demonstrating a new procedure for washing airplanes. After listening politely, Clark licked his index finger and rubbed it, hard, on what appeared to be a gleaming fuselage. The digit came away covered in grime. The procedure was duly overhauled. Even the model airplanes that crowd Clark's office are subject to his inspection. At one point during an interview, he stops to fret that the landing gear has fallen off a football-size plastic A380.

Clark's tenure has been defined by bold gestures, and he relishes recounting occasions when a seemingly doomed gamble went his way. He's claimed credit for silencing naysayers who told him that reviving the Jet Age concept of an onboard bar, in Emirates' case on the upper deck of the A380, would be an expensive folly that no passenger would bother using. (They very much do.) The same goes for the airborne showers in first class, requiring planes to take off with 2.2 metric tons of water, which Clark has said he had to ""work conspiratorially"" behind the backs of skeptical Airbus executives to develop. Since Clark took over, Emirates has several times set aircraft order records, culminating in a 2013 deal worth $99 billion at list prices.

But apart from picking up two jets destined for a Japanese budget carrier that went bust, Emirates hasn't bought a single plane since. With most viable routes already heavily served, the company has been forced to go farther afield to keep growing, pushing into ultralong-haul flights to the likes of Panama. Clark's current mood is cautious, verging on somber: 2016 was ""not a good year,"" he says, and ""I think '17 could be even flatter, slightly worse."" Oil executives and bankers aren't buying premium tickets like they used to; demand is plunging in sub-Saharan Africa; Syria, Libya, Tunisia, and, to a certain extent, even Turkey have fallen off the tourist map. These days, Emirates is as likely to reduce luxury as ramp it up. Some A380s are being flown without first class, in favor of more economy seats, and in September, Clark mused about introducing budget-carrier-style bag fees. In the airline's last earnings announcement, in which fiscal first-half profit fell almost two-thirds, Sheikh Ahmed warned that ""the bleak global economic outlook appears to be the new norm.""

More broadly, Clark concedes that Emirates' emergence as a boundary-pushing titan of global aviation was an outcome of an era that may now be at an end. ""It is true that we are a product of the multilateralism, the liberalization of trade,"" he says in his office, the lazy ballet of taxiing aircraft visible on the tarmac just over his left shoulder. On his desk, he's kept a collection of British newspapers from June 24, the day after U.K. voters rejected the liberal order by voting to leave the European Union. ""But are we going back to the '30s? No, no, no. The man, the woman in the street has been exposed to the good things, irrespective of faith, creed, gender, nationality, sexuality, it doesn't make any difference. Everybody's out there,"" he says. ""They can see the world is open to them. And I'm hoping that kind of sense will prevail. Maybe I'm just being a little bit naive, overoptimistic."" He spoke on Oct. 26, 13 days before Trump's election.

If there's anywhere that will test Clark's brand of optimism, it will be President Trump's Washington. Generalized distrust of foreigners, particularly Muslim ones, and a determination to reopen long-settled trade deals were among the only common threads in his erratic campaign. The so-called Open Skies agreements that allow unlimited flights between the U.S. and the Persian Gulf present a rare confluence of Trump targets, giving new energy to a lobbying group formed in 2015 by Delta, American, and United, along with several industry unions, called the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies.

The group claims the ME3 carriers have collectively received at least $42 billion in direct and indirect subsidies since 2004 and are twisting Open Skies deals to dump into the American market excessive capacity that wouldn't be possible without government help. It argues that the trio's growth is out of all proportion to the size of their home markets -- a population smaller than Ohio's, in the case of the U.A.E. -- and can only be the result of unfair advantages. In Emirates' case, the partnership pegs the 2004-14 subsidy figure at $6.8 billion, including $2.4 billion in fuel-hedging losses assumed by the Dubai government and $2.3 billion in subsidized airport charges. An additional $1.9 billion is the result, it says, of a ""union ban resulting in below-market labor costs"" and further unquantifiable benefits accrued from ""exemption from competition laws"" and the ""absence of independent regulatory oversight."" Emirates disputes all of these figures and says U.S. airlines have received ample advantages of their own, notably via Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that shielded them from creditors during restructuring efforts. As it also points out, U.S. carriers barely fly to India, Africa, or the Middle East, the main destinations to which it's ferrying American passengers.

The partnership's stated goal is to persuade Washington to force the governments of the U.A.E. and Qatar to end the purported subsidies as the price for continued unrestricted access to the U.S. The debate has had some nasty moments. In a 2015 CNN interview, Delta's then-CEO, Richard Anderson, noted that ""terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula"" were responsible for the U.S. airline industry's post-Sept. 11 meltdown, which he called ""a great irony."" (Anderson later apologized.) Delta also pulled its sponsorship of Atlanta's historic Fox Theatre after Qatar Airways held an event there.

""When you look at the fact that no U.S. carrier flies to the Gulf region and the ME3 have 30 flights a day to the U.S., how is that possible if not at the expense of U.S. jobs?"" asks Ed Bastian, Delta's current CEO. Gulf carrier flights that operate directly from Europe to the U.S., allowed under so-called fifth freedom rights, are a particular concern. While Emirates does so on just one route (Milan-New York), a significant expansion would threaten U.S. airlines' trans-Atlantic cash cow.

The partnership's lobbying of the Obama administration was inconclusive, in part because not all U.S. players are on board. JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines, both of which code-share with Emirates, have said they prefer the status quo. Boeing has stayed neutral; Emirates is its largest customer, and Qatar and Etihad aren't far behind. Bastian and other allies of the group, though, believe the new president will have their back. Trump ""has expressed great care for American jobs and the impact of foreign subsidies on U.S. workers,"" he says. ""He has been very clear that free trade shouldn't be at the expense of American jobs."" Adds Tim Canoll, the head of the Air Line Pilots Association, a partnership-supporting union: ""The political stars are aligning."" The group has already begun discussions with Trump's transition team, and it plans to increase its direct lobbying efforts as soon as cabinet and policy adviser positions are filled. If they're successful, Emirates' critics in Europe, particularly Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, are likely to revive their own attempts to throttle its expansion on that continent.

For now access remains open, and Emirates is pushing deeper into the U.S. In December it began daily flights to, of all places, Fort Lauderdale. Clark says U.S. airports are eager to bring Emirates to their terminals despite any controversy; Denver, whose mayor recently led a delegation to meet with Emirates in Dubai, may be next. The partnership claims most ME3 flights to the U.S. lose money and are intended to crush competition by thronging the market with cheap seats. The experience of Australia's Qantas Airways provides a cautionary tale. After trying and failing to compete with Gulf airlines on routes to Europe, losing hundreds of millions of dollars, Qantas in 2012 gave up and entered a comprehensive alliance with Clark. Most of its Europe-bound passengers are now booked on Emirates flights via Dubai.

Still, airline watchers aren't so sure about the U.S. partnership's claims. Demand for flights to markets like India and Africa has grown significantly in the U.S., even in second-rung cities. ""They're not eating someone's lunch,"" John Strickland, a U.K. aviation consultant, says of Emirates. ""They've created new lunch.""

Emirates and its U.S. antagonists agree on one thing: The vast majority of Emirates' passengers aren't going to Dubai. Three in five fliers are connecting to somewhere else, and Dubai's airport has been designed as a massive machine to facilitate their movements, a polished-stone fulcrum between Dar es Salaam and Guangzhou, Dallas and Dhaka. The bulk of flights arrive and depart in three ""waves"": one from 2 to 4:30 a.m., another from 7 to 11 a.m., and a third from 1:30 to 4 p.m. Between those rushes the airport is eerily quiet, even in the operations center, the size of a hockey rink, where Emirates manages the flights. A giant central screen shows the location of every Emirates plane in the air. A thick, curved line of blue avatars is headed to and from Western Europe; a smaller cluster moves between Dubai and Africa; another inches toward East Asia. Far to the north, flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco are headed straight over the top of the world.

To spend time on Planet Emirates is to be bombarded with reminders of the awesome scale of its operations, often proffered by staff who've worked there since the early days and remain mildly bewildered by what the company has become. The airline operates an industrial-size wine cellar in Burgundy, with 3.75 million bottles aging at any given time. Its flight kitchens are the largest in the world and make almost everything from scratch, from hummus to hamburgers, as well as 25,000 muffins a day. They incorporate what Emirates says is the world's largest dishwashing operation, using 17 colossal machines to clean 3.5 million items daily. In case of a breakdown, 200,000 sets of cutlery are kept in reserve.

Still, the strains of growth are apparent. The airport, which has only two runways and is hemmed in by development, can become severely congested at peak times, and the move to Dubai World Central is probably a decade away. On Skytrax, which aggregates customer reviews of airlines, Emirates gets an average of 6 out of 10 as fliers complain about inconsistent service across its sprawling network, a score lower than that of budget carrier EasyJet. (Skytrax nonetheless named Emirates its top airline of 2016, an award that draws on separate data.)

Meanwhile, online forums for pilots and cabin crew are crowded with complaints from Emirates staff about what they say are excessive hours and inflexible policies. For example, female cabin crew who've been employed less than three years must leave their jobs if they become pregnant. Because virtually none are locals and Emirates issues their visas, that generally means leaving Dubai. After three years of employee service, maternity leave is available but largely unpaid, and it depends on the mother being married; giving birth out of wedlock is a crime in the U.A.E. Staff also complain about curfews and visitor restrictions in Emirates-administered housing, which human resources chief Abdulaziz al-Ali says are necessary because ""we know a little more about this country than foreigners who come."" He insists that employees are happy -- so much so, in fact, that ""there is no reason for them to become unionized.""

Staff and passengers alike do have other options. Etihad and Qatar Airways are using the same geographic advantages to expand, cloning the ""superconnector"" model pioneered in Dubai. In Istanbul, an airport that may be as large as Dubai World Central is under construction and could eventually allow Turkish Airlines to become a global challenger. Then again, the superconnector model itself might fall apart. The proliferation of lighter, fuel-efficient jets such as the Boeing 787 are making long-haul routes between smaller cities economical, reducing the role for megahubs of all stripes.

In the 70-odd years of large-scale commercial aviation, no airline has managed to stay on top for long. Pan Am was the last word in intercontinental glamour in its day, and its day came to an end. It's a problem that Clark is clearly wrestling with as he contemplates his own retreat from the stage. He hasn't yet set a date for his retirement but acknowledges it isn't far off. No successor has been chosen yet.

""If I was in my 40s, I'd make bloody sure that in 20 years Emirates was right there and never came down a notch. I'dkeep. Up. The pressure,"" Clark says, pausing for emphasis. ""Adapting and changing to do everything we need to do to align ourselves not with what the establishment requires us to do, but what the man in the street requires us to do ... that'll keep us there. If that doesn't happen, they'll be running around with lots of empty airplanes.""

As Clark speaks, in the middle distance a crew of workmen moves gingerly across the roof of Terminal 3, washing away its accumulated coating of blown sand to reveal a skin of shining chrome. The procedure has to be repeated constantly. If it weren't, the airport would eventually sink back beneath the dunes.",Bloomberg Business,energy,,"['Dubai', 'United States', 'Canada', 'United Arab Emirates', 'London', 'Turkey', 'Malta', 'India', 'United Kingdom', 'Washington (state)']",Can Emirates Airline Dominate the Skies?,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-01-05/is-emirates-airline-running-out-of-sky,None,

11401153,2017-11-30,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The European Union, United Nations and African Union have agreed to an emergency plan to dismantle people-smuggling networks and repatriate stranded migrants, in an effort to ease a human rights disaster in Libya, officials said.

Images broadcast by CNN earlier this month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by Libyan traffickers, sparking outrage in Europe and anger in Africa. It forced the issue of abuse of African migrants heading for Europe to the top of the agenda of a summit meant to focus on Africa's youth.

European Council President Donald Tusk called the slavery reports ""horrifying"" during the opening ceremony of the African Union-European Union summit on Wednesday.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the plan included the establishment of an ""operational task-force"" composed of European and African police and intelligence services.

""The goal will be in very short order to be able to arrest identified traffickers, dismantle these networks and their financing which goes through banks and payments that in the region contribute ... to sustaining terrorism,"" he said late on Wednesday.

France would use its military presence in the region to help break up trafficking networks, but the plan would not involve sending French troops into Libya, Macron said at a press conference in Ghana on Thursday.

""On Libyan soil, it is now up to the Libyan government to decide in connection with the African Union,"" he said. ""It is important to preserve the sovereignty of Libya.""

The plan, the details of which emerged on Thursday, came from a meeting of UN officials, EU leaders and government representatives from Chad, Niger, Morocco, Congo and Libya that was called by France on Wednesday.

The European Union, African Union and United Nations agreed to freeze assets and impose financial sanctions against known smugglers.

Libya's government, which has promised to investigate reports of slave auctions, said it would grant U.N. agencies access to migrant camps in areas under its control, German officials said.

EU countries, meanwhile, will finance the repatriation of migrants from Libya, a process that is already being organized by the International Organization for Migration, they said.

Allowing Africans to come to Europe on a temporary basis for three of four years of training or schooling was also discussed, according to European government officials. ""Circular migration"" could be key to easing illegal migration, experts have said.

Regional governments have also agreed to educate Africans about the dangers of migration, and there will be stronger coordination between security services across North, West and Central Africa to eradicate smuggling.

11401154,2017-11-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Tuesday that it had conducted two air strikes against Islamic States militants in Libya in the past few days.

In a statement, U.S. Africa Command said one strike was carried out on Friday and another one on Sunday. It said both strikes were carried out near the city of Fuqaha, but did not say how many militants had been killed.

The statement said the strikes were carried out in coordination with Libya's Government of National Accord.

Islamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city. The group imposed its hard-line rule on residents and extended its control along about 155 miles (250 km) of Libya's Mediterranean coastline.

The North African country has been gripped by turmoil since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising ended Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule, giving space to Islamist militants and smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe.

Political and military fractures have left the country mired in conflict and the OPEC member's economy in freefall. Rival parliaments and governments have vied for power.

A month ago U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame, the latest in a series of Libya envoys since 2011, announced a one-year ""action plan"" for a transition toward presidential and parliamentary elections.

Since then the U.N. has hosted in Tunis delegations from rival parliaments from eastern Libya and Tripoli, which are meant to draw up amendments to a previous U.N.-mediated plan signed in December 2015.

But at the end of a second round of talks Salame only said discussions would continue without giving a new date.

""There are some area of consensus... but there are parts which need discussions with the political leaderships inside Libya,"" Salame told reporters without giving details.

The U.N. had tried a similar approach in 2015 of hosting Libyans in luxury hotels abroad but the deal never won support from the power-brokers and factions aligned with military commander Khalifa Haftar that control eastern Libya.

The effort aims to end the turmoil that developed in Libya after the 2011 NATO-backed uprising ended Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule, giving space to Islamist militants and smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe.

Political and military fractures have left the country mired in conflict and the OPEC member's economy in freefall. Rival parliaments and governments have vied for power.

Last week, U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame announced a one-year ""action plan"" for a transition toward presidential and parliamentary elections.

The plan got underway on Tuesday with negotiations between delegations from rival parliaments from eastern Libya and Tripoli, which are meant to draw up amendments to a previous U.N.-mediated plan signed in December 2015.

As the delegations convened in Tunis, Salame said he hoped the amendments could be agreed rapidly and that he sensed a ""window of opportunity"" for reconciliation.

""All Libyans are fed up. They are going from transition to transition with no horizon,"" he said.

""We have sleeping institutions that need to be awoken, divided institutions that need to be united, and hijacked institutions that need to be rebuilt.""

The 2015 deal has only had limited support from power-brokers and was never endorsed by factions aligned with military commander Khalifa Haftar that control eastern Libya.

Haftar, who has been courted by Western states after making military gains, was in Rome on Tuesday where he met Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti and Italy's highest ranking military officer, Claudio Graziano.

Pinotti expressed hope that all parties would support Salame's ""inclusive political strategy ... excluding any military solution"", according to a defense ministry statement.

Italy and other Western states have tried to work with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, but it has been hamstrung by internal splits and has been unable to halt a slide in living standards or tame the power of armed groups.

""We're here to move the political process forward for the sake of the country's stability,"" said Moussa Faraj, head of the delegation from the High Council of State in Tripoli, according to a tweet from the United Nations from the Tunis meeting which got closed to the press after Salame's speech.

11401158,2017-06-09,"TUNIS Emirati assistance that violates a U.N. arms embargo has significantly boosted air power for forces loyal to Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, a report by U.N. investigators published on Friday said.

Air power has helped Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) gain the upper hand since last year in Libya's conflict between rival groups vying for power.

The panel of experts which reports on violations of U.N. sanctions across Libya said Haftar's forces had received aircraft as well as military vehicles from the United Arab Emirates, and had built up an air base at Al Khadim.

The annual U.N. report provides rare detail on the level of outside intervention in Libya, where foreign backing for rival armed camps is widely seen as having exacerbated conflict.

Friday's report said there had been a general increase in direct foreign support to armed factions in Libya, breaching a U.N. arms embargo imposed during the country's 2011 uprising and tightened in 2014.

Much of the section on recent transfers of materiel or other assistance was taken up by the development of the LNA air force and reports of UAE assistance.

""The United Arab Emirates have been providing both material support and direct support to the LNA, which have significantly increased the air support available to the LNA,"" it said.

The panel said its requests for information from the UAE had received no response.

Competition for power and wealth between broad and shifting coalitions of armed groups has thrown Libya into turmoil over the past six years. A collection of Islamist-leaning militias took control of the capital, Tripoli, in 2014, installing a self-declared government as their opponents set up a rival administration in the east.

The eastern government is aligned with Haftar, who has close relations to the UAE and Egypt and has rejected a third, U.N.-backed Libyan government that moved to Tripoli in March 2016. Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army has extended its control over towns, military bases and oil facilities in eastern and central Libya since last year. Air power has played a key role in those advances, analysts say.

The U.N. report included satellite imagery of Al Khadim air base, about 105 km (65 miles) east of Benghazi, between July 2014 and March 2017, showing a gradual build-up of infrastructure and aircraft, including drones ""most probably"" operated by the UAE.

The U.N. panel said it received information that attack helicopters were delivered to the LNA in April 2015. One Mi-24p helicopter was traced back to Belarus, which confirmed it had delivered four of the aircraft to the UAE in 2014.

It also published a photo of an AT-802i single engine plane which it said was based in eastern Libya. The plane, originally designed for agricultural or firefighting use, was repurposed in the United States for counter-insurgency and sold to the UAE, the report said.

The panel said it had confirmed a delivery of 93 armored personnel carriers and 549 armored and non-armored vehicles to the LNA in the eastern city of Tobruk in April 2016. The personnel carriers likely included Panther T6 and Tygra models, both made by companies based in the UAE, the report said, and were delivered by ship from Saudi Arabia.

11401161,2017-05-16,"Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) has become the dominant force in eastern Libya over the past three years, though it continues to face armed resistance in Benghazi and other regions, and to take heavy losses.

The LNA is aligned with a government and parliament based in eastern Libya that rejects a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli.

That has frustrated Western efforts to end a conflict between two loose and shifting alliances that escalated in 2014, worsening the divisions and instability that surfaced with the 2011 uprising against the late strongman Muammar Gaddafi.

Haftar, a divisive one-time Gaddafi ally, launched ""Operation Dignity"" against Islamist militants who had carried out a wave of bombings and assassinations in Benghazi, though he has also fought former rebels opposed to military rule.

He has received backing from foreign powers including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

On Tuesday, thousands of LNA troops paraded in Tocra, 40 miles (65 km) northeast of Benghazi, in front of Haftar, other LNA commanders and senior politicians from the eastern government and parliament. Tanks, Grad rocket launchers, helicopters and fighter jets were also displayed.

The event, billed as the largest of its kind since 2011, was reminiscent of military parades under Gaddafi. It was broadcast in full on pro-Haftar TV.

In a speech delivered as parachutists with Libyan flags attached to their feet descended in front of him, Haftar presented the LNA as fighting against the odds to prevail.

""They imposed an arms embargo on us and supported terrorists and cut off men's heads and fired rockets and blocked oil exports - all of this to make us kneel. But we will never kneel except before God,"" he said.

Haftar and his allies say the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) of being beholden to militias, including some with Islamist allegiances. In his speech he repeated pledges to help stabilize the capital, saying the army was for all Libyans.

""We will not leave Tripoli as a hotbed of terrorists and the country will not rest until Tripoli returns to the homeland,"" he said. Haftar's rivals fear he will try to take military control of the capital, though most doubt he has the capacity to do so.

Haftar has recently appeared more open to dialogue, meeting the GNA's head in Abu Dhabi. But subsequent comments by the foreign minister in Tripoli suggesting acceptance of Haftar as head of the army sparked an angry reaction amongst factions in western Libya.

The LNA took over key oil ports in September but briefly lost control of them earlier this year.

It is still fighting in the Benghazi neighborhoods of Souq al-Hout and Sabri, where a military spokesman said one of his men was killed and one wounded by a landmine explosion on Tuesday.

11401162,2017-05-15,"ROME Italian mafia have infiltrated one of Europe's largest reception centers for migrants, creaming off state funds that were earmarked for the care of new arrivals, prosecutors said on Monday.

Police arrested 68 people in early morning raids in the southern toe of Italy, including a priest and the head of a Roman Catholic association that runs the Sant'Anna Cara immigrant center in the town of Isola Capo Rizzuto.

Amongst the accusations leveled against those detained were involvement in a mafia organization, extortion, misappropriation of state funds and fraud, said a statement from police in the southern city of Catanzaro.

There was no immediate response from those arrested.

The head of parliament's anti-mafia commission hailed the operation. ""The Cara of Isola Capo Rizzuto had become a money printing operation for organized crime thanks to the complicity of those who ran the center,"" Rosy Bindi said.

""This operation shows the ability of the mafia to take advantage of the weaknesses and fragility of our times with its predatory and parasitic approach,"" she added.

Police said many of those arrested belonged to the Arena clan of the 'Ndrangheta mafia -- Italy's most powerful organized crime group and one of Europe's biggest cocaine importers.

The police statement said the Arena clan was suspected of winning contracts to provide catering for migrants both in the Isola Capo Rizzuto center and on the southern island of Lampedusa, which is on the front line of the migrant crisis.

More than half a million migrants have reached Italy since 2014, mostly by boat from neighboring Libya. The government has set up reception centers across the country to take care of the new arrivals.

The Isola Capo Rizzuto center has room for more than 1,200 people, making it one of the largest in the country. The state gives it some 16 million euros ($17.5 million) a year to house and feed the migrants.

The clash came when police raided a house in Sidi Bouzid where the group had been under surveillance. The group had been in the coastal city of Sousse, where an Islamic State-allied gunman killed more than 30 tourists in a 2015 attack on a beach resort.

""The police engaged in gun fire with these terrorists in Sidi Bouzid. They killed one and another blew up his explosive belt,"" the official said. Other suspects were still being pursued.

11401164,2017-03-21,"The self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said dozens of its Islamist-led opponents were killed as the siege at unfinished tower blocks in the eastern city was broken on Saturday when fighters and their families tried to escape.

Soon after, photos and videos emerged on social media appearing to show LNA troops posing with corpses and parading the rotting body of a prominent opponent on a vehicle.

Eastern military figures, separate from internationally recognized officials in Tripoli in the west, present the LNA as an expanding and increasingly capable force that will eventually control the whole of Libya.

The LNA's general command called on unit commanders to hand over all those filmed carrying out abuses to the military police, for questioning by a military committee.

""The actions carried out by members of the Libyan National Army after the liberation of west Benghazi are considered individual acts and do not represent the instructions of the army,"" it said in a statement late on Monday.

""Those who committed these violations will be held accountable for their actions and for not following military law.""

The suspected abuses raise fresh questions over the coherence of the LNA as a professional fighting body.

Its leader, Khalifa Haftar, is widely assumed to be seeking national power. He has spurned a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli that has sought to unify political and armed factions that splintered into rival camps in the east and west in 2014, three years after the uprising that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi.

The LNA's critics say it is a loose collection of armed groups with fickle loyalties and little discipline, similar to the militias operating in western Libya.

They point to its slow progress in Benghazi, where it launched an operation against Islamists and other opponents nearly three years ago, but still faces pockets of resistance.

This month the LNA suffered a setback southwest of Benghazi, losing control of two oil ports before regaining them 11 days later.

It says it is now pursuing its opponents, who it accuses the U.N.-backed government of supporting, in the desert region of Jufra, whilst also preparing to ""liberate"" Tripoli from the militias that control it.

The offensive in Jufra and the LNA's stated intention of taking control of the Tamanhent air base risks triggering renewed fighting between the LNA and forces from the western city of Misrata, which control the base.

It comes as some of Misrata's armed groups, which became powerful during the 2011 uprising and the conflicts that followed, have come under pressure in Tripoli where they have lost ground to local rivals and faced popular protests.

U.N. Libya envoy Martin Kobler warned on Monday of a ""dangerous escalation across Libya emanating from the deteriorating security situation in Tripoli and events in Misrata and Benghazi"".

""I call for all parties to put Libya and the unity of Libya ahead of their own narrow interests. The violence, hate speech, and mutilation of corpses in Libya is completely unacceptable.""

Dozens of family members had also been in the besieged buildings and an unknown number were detained by the LNA. It was not immediately clear whether any of the LNA's opponents or their families had escaped.

The LNA said it had lost a MiG-21 fighter jet over the Benghazi district of Sabri on Saturday, though the pilot had ejected. It still faces armed opposition in the northern neighborhoods of Sabri and Souq al-Hout.

LNA leader Khalifa Haftar launched his Dignity Operation in Benghazi in May 2014, saying he wanted to rid the city of Islamist militants following a series of bombings and assassinations.

Some of his opponents have openly acknowledged their allegiance to Islamic State or al Qaeda-linked groups but others say they are fighting to prevent a return to authoritarian rule in Libya.

Haftar has rejected a beleaguered U.N.-backed government in Tripoli that was meant to reunite the country after it split between eastern and western based governments and military factions in 2014.

On Friday, there were demonstrations against militia rule in central Tripoli after unusually violent clashes this week, and some voiced support for Haftar before the protests were broken up amid gunfire.

Haftar, who many suspect of seeking national rule, addressed the capital's residents on local TV after the protests saying, ""your armed forces will not abandon you, and we will be by your side until Tripoli is returned to the homeland.""

11401166,2017-01-02,"TRIPOLI A deputy leader of Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) announced his resignation on Monday, saying the U.N.-backed administration had failed to tackle urgent problems arising from years of conflict and political disarray.

The resignation of Musa al-Koni casts doubt on the future of the government in its current form, just over a year after it was launched under a U.N.-mediated deal that had only partial support from Libya's rival factions.

Western powers backed the GNA to tackle Islamic State, boost Libya's oil production, and help stem the flow of sub-Saharan migrants from Libya to Europe.

But though Islamic State has been ousted from its former stronghold of Sirte and oil production has recovered slightly, the GNA has largely failed to exert its authority over a country that slid into lawlessness after the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.

The GNA's leaders, including Koni, arrived in Tripoli in March, but have struggled to impose their authority. Militias still hold real power and living conditions have deteriorated.

""I announce my resignation due the failure of the Presidential Council, because it holds responsibility for the killing, kidnapping, and rape that happened over the past year,"" Koni told a press conference in Tripoli on Monday.

""I don't think we are unaware of what the citizens are suffering, but we are incapable, and I admit that we are failures because we didn't solve the problems, which are many.""

The GNA has been unable to win endorsement for a cabinet from a parliament based in the east of the country, where power-brokers have continued to back a rival government as armed forces allied to them and under the command of Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar have made military gains on the ground.

In Tripoli, the GNA has gradually taken control of some ministries, but it has been unable to improve security or deal with a liquidity crisis, steep inflation, and a collapse in public healthcare provision.

A self-declared government that the GNA displaced in the capital has recently tried to make a comeback.

The Presidential Council is made up of nine members who are meant to represent different geographical regions and political currents within Libya. Koni is one of three members from the south.

The Council has been bitterly divided, with two of its number mostly boycotting proceedings, and different members regularly issuing contradictory statements.

At the weekend, an eastern member of the Council, Fathi al-Majbari, announced a series of appointments during GNA Prime Minister Fayez Seraj's absence that were subsequently repudiated by another of the council's members.

They were to discuss the possibility of forming a government of national union, the source told Reuters.

But Haftar said talks with Seraj begun 2-1/2 years ago had yielded no result and the existing state of war now required combat rather than politics.

""Once the extremists are defeated we can go back to talking about democracy and elections. But not now,"" Haftar was quoted as telling Tuesday's edition of Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

The outlook for Seraj's government, already uncertain as it struggles to fulfill Western hopes that it could bring stability to Libya, worsened on Monday when one of its deputy leaders announced his resignation, saying it had failed to tackle urgent problems.

Haftar said his forces now controlled about 80 percent of the country, according to the newspaper.

A deeply divisive figure portrayed by his rivals as a military strongman seeking national power, he has been waging a campaign against Islamists and other opponents in eastern Libya for more than two years.

Haftar has close ties to Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and said that on a recent trip to Moscow he had tried to reactivate contracts there that were interrupted in 2011, when an uprising toppled former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

An arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council is stopping any weapons arriving in Libya, but Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to lift it, Haftar said.

He said his patrols were ensuring the rule of law was being upheld around the oil ports of Ras Lanuf, Brega and Es Sider.

""If our army controlled our southern border, there would be fewer problems for everyone. And the same is true for the energy plants so dear to Italy. I would be very happy to discuss this with the managers of (oil major) Eni,"" Haftar said.

11401563,2017-08-24,"TUNIS (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson met Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar during a visit to Benghazi on Thursday and urged him to stick to a ceasefire announced in Paris last month and to back U.N.-led efforts to end Libya's conflict.

Johnson's visit is the latest show of growing Western recognition of Haftar, who has long been supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates for his anti-Islamist stance.

Haftar is the dominant figure in eastern Libya and since early last year has spurned the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital, Tripoli, while making military gains on the ground.

The GNA, hampered by infighting and its failure to win endorsement from eastern-based factions, has largely failed to extend its authority or end the turmoil that developed after a NATO-backed uprising toppled Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Since 2014 Libya has had rival governments in Tripoli and the east. It has become the main departure point for migrants catching boats to Europe and it has seen Islamic State establish and then lose a regional stronghold in the coastal city of Sirte.

International efforts to broker a political deal have resulted in two meetings between Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, one in Abu Dhabi in May and the other in Paris in July.

At the Paris meeting the two men shook hands on a ceasefire and elections next year, though Haftar quickly played down the commitments.

Johnson met Haftar during a visit to the eastern city of Benghazi, where Haftar declared victory in early July after a three-year military campaign against Islamists and other rivals.

He said he had encouraged Haftar to back new U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame's efforts to find a political settlement for Libya by revising the 2015 deal that created GNA.

""Field Marshall Haftar has a role to play in the political process,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""I urged him to adhere to the commitments he made during recent meetings in Paris, to respect a ceasefire, and to work with Mr. Salame in order to amend the Libyan Political Agreement.""

Haftar, who fell out with Gaddafi in the 1980s and lived for two decades in the United States, remains a divisive figure in Libya. His forces have replaced civilian mayors in many eastern cities and talked of ""liberating"" Tripoli. Critics have said they fear a return to military rule.

On Wednesday, Johnson made his second trip to Tripoli to meet Seraj. He also traveled to Misrata, a port city and major military power that has led opposition to Haftar.

""I have encouraged all sides to resolve their differences by dialogue, not conflict, and to respect international human rights law,"" Johnson said.

Since the meeting in Paris, Haftar's Libyan National Army has threatened to advance into the eastern city of Derna, and tightened a blockade around the city.

The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for a commander in an elite Libyan National Army unit accused of executing dozens of prisoners in the closing stages of the Benghazi campaign.

11401564,2017-08-07,"BENGHAZI, Libya/TUNIS (Reuters) - Residents of Derna in east Libya say they are facing critical shortages after Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) tightened its longstanding siege around the city last week.

Haftar's eastern-based LNA, one of a number of factions that have vied for power in Libya since a 2011 uprising ended Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade rule, is waging a military campaign against a coalition of Islamist militants and ex-rebels known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC) that controls Derna.

Attention has shifted to the coastal city after Haftar announced victory in a three-year military campaign against a similar coalition in Benghazi, 350 km (210 miles) to the west, a month ago.

The LNA launches occasional air strikes over Derna and at the end of July, one of its fighter jets was shot down. The pilot was killed. The LNA subsequently reinforced its siege.

""The situation is extremely bad. Everything is stopped, the supplies are depleted and nothing is getting into the city,"" one resident told Reuters by telephone.

""There is a total blockade with no entry or exit. They only allow you to leave as a displaced person.""

Another resident said most bakeries had closed because of a shortage of fuel, and that petrol stations had been shut for eight months. There was an acute shortage of medicine, he said, though some oxygen tanks were delivered to a hospital in Derna on Monday.

The United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Libya has expressed concern over reports of ""severe shortages of basic necessities, including life saving medical supplies"" in Derna, while the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli called on all sides to ""facilitate ways to provide for all the needs of the citizens"".

The LNA is aligned with a parliament and government based in the eastern Libya that has spurned the GNA.

Haftar and the head of the GNA met in Paris in late July amid efforts to broker a peace settlement for Libya. A ceasefire was announced, though it excluded ""counter-terrorism"" operations. The LNA commonly brands its rivals as terrorists.

Derna has a history of militancy. It was occupied by Islamic State militants in late 2014, but they were later ousted by the DMSC. Since then, forces loyal to the LNA have bolstered their blockade. Supplies of food, cash and medicine were disrupted or confiscated even before the latest tightening of the siege.

The LNA says it has been hitting militant targets that it has identified on the outskirts of in Derna, including ammunition stores. It says it is preparing to use further strikes if peace efforts with local leaders fail.

In May, the city was also a target of Egyptian air strikes. Egypt said it was responding to an attack against Coptic Christians on its territory, though that attack was claimed by Islamic State.

Haftar, a figure many believe is seeking national power in Libya, has enjoyed strong backing from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, as well as the United Arab Emirates.

11401565,2017-07-20,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - The Libyan National Army, the main military force in eastern Libya, on Thursday denied accusations that its troops were involved in torture and killing of prisoners after the United Nations urged the LNA to investigate.

The U.N. Human Rights Commission earlier this week called on the LNA, one of the many competing armed factions fighting in Libya since its 2011 civil war, to examine reports of summary executions of prisoners.

""We affirm that there is no truth to what is described in the statement regarding the torture or killing prisoners,"" LNA spokesman Ahmad Messmari said.

The LNA has expanded its presence in central and southern Libya as it vies for control with forces linked to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and other opponents.

LNA commander Khalifa Haftar has gained ground with Egyptian and United Arab Emirates support, and Western states say Haftar must be part of any solution to Libya's conflict.

U.N. officials voiced concern this week that, after recent fighting in Benghazi, people taken prisoner by the LNA, which effectively controls eastern Libya, might be at imminent risk of torture and even summary execution.

Several videos circulated on social media this year claimed to show a commander of LNA's Special Forces executing a number of masked and handcuffed prisoners.

""For the alleged video (of the commander), we have already launched investigation into the video and we will publish the results when they are issued,"" Messmari said.

""We are deeply concerned that, after recent fighting in Benghazi, people taken prisoner by members of the Libyan National Army, which effectively controls eastern Libya, may be at imminent risk of torture and even summary execution,"" U.N. human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell told a news briefing.

Reports have suggested the involvement of Special Forces, a unit aligned with the LNA, ""in torturing detainees and summarily executing at least 10 captured men"", she said.

The Libyan National Army announced last March that it would conduct investigations into alleged war crimes but has not shared any information, Throssell said.

""We urge the LNA to ensure there is a full, impartial investigation into these allegations,"" she said.

Throssell also called on the group to suspend Mahmoud al-Werfalli from his duties as a Special Forces field commander pending the conclusion of such an investigation.

A video circulating on social media in March allegedly showed al-Werfalli shooting dead three men who were kneeling and facing a wall with their hands tied behind their backs, Throssell said.

In June, two further videos appeared to show summary executions carried out by LNA fighters on his orders.

But she also highlighted Germany's history of cooperating with India and China in a global world.

On Monday, Merkel had underlined her doubts about the reliability of the United States as an ally. She

Merkel talked to Modi in Berlin about developing cooperation with India.

""That's of huge importance and in no way directed against any other relationships and certainly not against the trans-Atlantic ties, which have historically been very important for us and will remain so in future,"" she said.

Merkel said she and Modi had discussed open markets and free and fair trade during their meeting in Berlin.

In a thinly veiled dig at the Trump administration, Merkel said ""protectionist tendencies"" were increasing worldwide and this made it necessary to remain open and ensure conditions for negotiations are fair.

""For that reason it's important to us that we make progress on the German-Indian, or rather EU-Indian free trade agreement,"" she said at a Berlin business forum where she shared a platform with Modi.

Modi said economic collaboration between Germany and India was still ""below full potential"".

Speaking at a joint news conference with Modi, Merkel reiterated her view that ""we need to take our fate in Europe into our own hands"".

Europe needs to step up its presence on the international stage, for example by bringing about solutions to issues such as the Libya conflict, migration and economic problems including unemployment, she said.

Merkel praised India for implementing that climate pact very ""intensively and in a very committed way"" and Modi said people had no right to ruin the environment for future generations.

The German and Indian governments signed numerous agreements, including on cyber cooperation, development cooperation, education and railway safety.

In a sign of Berlin's shifting focus towards Asia, Merkel is also due to meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.

11401571,2017-05-03,"The statements came a day after intense diplomatic pressure resulted in a meeting in Abu Dhabi between eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar and the head of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, Fayez Seraj.

Haftar is the key figure for eastern factions that, frustrating international efforts to end Libya's conflict, spurned Seraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) after it was established in the capital last year.

There was no mention in the statement from Seraj of plans reported by pro-Haftar media on Tuesday to restructure the unity government's leadership and hold fresh elections next year.

A source close to the GNA leadership said the two sides had initially tried to agree on a joint statement before deciding to issue separate declarations.

Conflicting accounts of initial agreements and leaks of documents neither side signed have in the past confused international mediation and negotiations to end the conflict in Libya, which fell into factional fighting in the years after a 2011 civil war ousted Muammar Gaddafi.

Last month Italy pledged money, training and equipment to help Libya fight people smugglers, a deal that was endorsed by European Union member states.

But Libya is still far from stable. Two governments are vying for power - in Tobruk to the east and Tripoli to the west - and the country remains mired in factional fighting and lawlessness.

The authorities in eastern Libya have rejected the deal struck between Rome and Tripoli.

""I'm not so naive as to not understand the situation there,"" Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti told reporters. ""But we cannot remain immobile and wait for the country to stabilize.""

He said the Libya agreement and next week's meeting were not just ""talk"", but strategic steps toward managing mass migration to Europe.

So far this year more than 16,000 migrants - a 36 percent increase on the same period last year - have been rescued at sea and brought to Italy after Libya-based people smugglers piled them onto flimsy boats.

As part of the deal, Italy and the EU have promised to fund migrant camps on Libyan soil, but they need U.N. agencies to help manage them. Those same agencies have said Libya is not safe for migrants.

""Migrants and refugees in detention (in Libya) are held outside any legal process and in conditions which are generally inhuman. They are exposed to malnutrition, extortion, torture, sexual violence and other abuses,"" four U.N. chiefs said in joint statement last month.

On Friday, Italy's opposition 5-Star Movement also took issue with the Libya agreement, calling it ""a sham"". In a statement, 5-Star lawmakers said Libya was too dangerous for Italy's diplomats, urging the closure of the embassy in Tripoli.

Last week Tripoli was gripped by heavy fighting as armed groups allied with Seraj took over a compound that had been occupied by a rival leader, while forces in Libya's Oil Crescent battled for control of two major oil ports.

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Less than two weeks after OPEC's decision to extend oil production cuts, Libya and Nigeria - the only two exempt members of the group - are signalling their intent to raise output next year.

While several ministers at the Nov. 30 meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries suggested the two nations had joined the output-curbing deal, both are working to add to their peak production from this year.

On Friday, oil company Total said its new Egina field offshore Nigeria was on track to start next year - adding 10 percent to the country's production.

The field will have a capacity of 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) and launch in the fourth quarter of 2018, counterbalancing production constrained by ageing pipelines, perpetual theft and sabotage.

""That could certainly change the dynamics,"" said Ehsan Ul-Haq, head of crude and products at Resource Economist, a consultancy.

The Nigerian petroleum ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the Egina field startup, and whether production elsewhere would be curtailed as a result.

On Saturday, the head of Libya's U.N.-backed government met the head of Libya's National Oil Corp (NOC) and the governor of Tripoli's central bank to discuss how the corporation could get more cash to raise oil output next year.

The NOC received a quarter of its requested budget in 2017, hampering efforts to sustain oil output near 1 million bpd.

Any additional funds could help make crucial repairs to the country's energy infrastructure, a regular target for militant attacks, and boost output above the roughly 1 million bpd mark where it currently stands.

Libya's NOC has so far not spoken officially about the OPEC deal and declined a Reuters request for comment.

The developments may come as a surprise to market observers, who, after the Nov. 30 meeting, believed Nigeria and Libya had agreed to participate in the OPEC agreement by imposing official caps at their peak 2017 production levels.

Instead, the two countries merely provided their production outlook for 2018 and an assessment that the combined total would not exceed 2.8 million bpd, their forecast output for 2017, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

That outlook was dependent on both countries' finances and security situation, one of those sources said.

The headline of a statement issued by Nigeria's petroleum ministry on the day of the OPEC meeting stressed, in block capitals, that Nigeria and Libya were exempt from cuts.

Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu emphasised in the statement that the nation's condensates - a form of ultra-light crude - were exempt from any total, giving it leeway in calculations. He also told local media there was ""no obligation"" to do anything.

Oil production from the two countries has averaged 1.7 million bpd and 900,000 bpd, respectively, this year according to Reuters assessments. PRODN-NG PRODN-LY

11401636,2017-12-07,"TUNIS (Reuters) - More than 90 mayors from across Libya's political divides are meeting for the first time in an effort to shore up their role in tackling conflict-linked crises and promote themselves as a unifying movement.

Local councils are one of the few parts of the vast North African state still functioning in a country where rival camps have split the government and major institutions as they vie for power and a share of shrunken oil revenues.

""When a citizen grumbles or complains about a service, he goes to the municipality. There is no other place for him to go,"" said Abdulrahman el-Abbar, mayor of the eastern city of Benghazi, before the three-day meeting that began on Wednesday in Hammamet in neighboring Tunisia - security risks and political schisms make meeting inside Libya difficult.

""You need to reinforce (the municipality's) powers so that it can provide the right services to the people.""

Despite Libya's oil wealth, public services were weak under Muammar Gaddafi's long rule. As Libya splintered and lawlessness set in following the 2011 uprising that ousted Gaddafi, services steadily collapsed.

A U.N.-backed government has largely replaced a self-declared rival in the capital Tripoli, but a third, almost powerless government, has held out in eastern Libya, aligning itself with military commander Khalifa Haftar.

All have overseen a worsening of living conditions, leaving residents seeking local or improvised solutions.

Abdulrahman al-Hamedi, mayor of Tripoli's Abu Salim district, says he has few resources to support residents crushed by rapid inflation, cash shortages and disrupted services.

In what used to be one of the region's richest countries, monthly wages are now often worth less than $100 because of the sharp depreciation of the Libyan dinar on the black market, Hamedi said.

Abu Salim has been shaken by militia battles from the revolution until earlier this year, and is also home to large numbers of displaced people from other conflict-ridden areas.

""Currently the security situation is relatively stable,"" said Hamedi. ""The economic situation is really terrible, given the lack of basic services that the citizen would normally be provided with, such as electricity or water or gas, or obtaining cash or even food products.""

The United Nations relaunched a peace process in September, but the mayors have little hope of quick progress.

The Hammamet meeting, which was facilitated by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Geneva-based private diplomacy organization, brings elected mayors from the west aligned with the U.N.-backed government together with eastern mayors, some of whom, like Abbar, owe their positions to Haftar.

They are discussing ways to act as a force for reconciliation as well as pressing for devolved powers.

""All the Libyan municipalities are in contact from the extreme east to the extreme west and the south; we don't have any problems,"" said Yousef Ibderi, mayor of Gharyan, 80 km (50 miles) south of Tripoli, who uses a walking frame after being hit by a sniper's bullet early last year.

""In the last three and a half years there has been no strong government, there's been no presence of the governments at all, but the municipalities were active despite a complete lack of budget and means, they were the guardians of stability and peace,"" he said.

""So we consider decentralization to be a very, very important solution and one that we need to work on.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Hammamet, Tunisia', 'Tripoli', 'Tunisia', 'Gharyan']",Libyan mayors meet for more leverage to tackle country's meltdown,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-mayors-idUSKBN1E11LP,None,

The governor of the eastern bank, Ali al-Hibri is aligned with a rival government based in eastern Libya. He has little leverage, since the recognized central bank in Tripoli has continued to control oil revenues and disburse funds across the country, with international backing.

But four of six board members of the Tripoli-based Central Bank of Libya are aligned with the eastern-based factions that tried to set up parallel financial institutions as conflict in Libya escalated in 2014. Hibri's central bank is one of those institutions.

The split between the eastern and the Tripoli governments is one consequence of the uprising that overthrew strongman Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Libya was left with two governments and an assortment of armed factions vying for power.

The political split has contributed to an economic crisis that has left many Libyans struggling. Inflation is running at more than 30 percent and people queue for days to withdraw cash from banks. On the black market, the value of the dinar has slid more than 600 percent since 2014.

Western diplomats say unifying the exchange rates of the two governments could help curb corruption. Some well-connected Libyans get dollars at the official rate on the pretext of importing goods, then sell them at the black market rate.

Hibri said in a rare interview he would not meet the governor of Tripoli's central bank, Sadiq al-Kabir, but he expected a devaluation and economic reform plan to be pushed through by the recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), headed by Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, and its central bank.

""I am cooperating with (Seraj),"" Hibri said. ""We are going to reform the exchange rate. We are going to find out how we are going to reform the liquidity problem. We are going to find how to control inflation.""

Under the evolving plans, bloated subsidy spending would be replaced by cash payments, he said.

The Tripoli central bank said earlier this month that an economic and financial reform plan had been agreed at a meeting in Tunis of the two governments and Libya's Audit Bureau. It gave no details.

Kabir's relations with the GNA have been tense, and it remains unclear when or how such plans might be implemented. There was no mention of changing the official exchange rate, which remains fixed at 1.36 dinars to the dollar, while the parallel rate has fallen to about 9.5 dinars.

The U.N. and Western powers have been pushing both central banks to work together as they seek to create a unified government to stabilize the oil-rich nation.

Hibri said devaluation would ""probably"" ease the liquidity shortage, but that ""you need some cover for the period until the exchange rate reform takes place"".

The bank would therefore likely discuss a fresh order for bank notes from Russia at a board meeting next month.

""When we meet in the next board we shall decide - we need to study how much the market needs. We shall have to solve the problem of liquidity,"" Hibri said.

The eastern central bank took its first delivery of banknotes from Russia last year, after failing to obtain supplies from British and German companies. The move came as eastern-based factions backing military commander Khalifa Haftar forged closer ties with Russia.

The final batch of the 4 billion dinars was delivered about three months ago, Hibri said.

Last month, the east took a first delivery of coins made in Russia, which Hibri said amounted to 15 million dinars. A further 85 million dinars in coins is due to be shipped by mid-2018.

Hibri restated claims that the east was receiving less than its fair share of funding for salaries and other costs from the Tripoli central bank, saying he had raised 15 billion dinars through treasury bonds since 2015 to support public spending in the east.",Reuters,energy,,"['Tripoli', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Tunis', 'United Kingdom', 'Germany']",Libya's eastern central bank may order more cash from Russia: governor,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-economy-idUSKBN1DU22V,None,
11401638,2017-11-22,"ROME (Reuters) - A deal with Libya that has slashed the number of migrants reaching Italy could scupper the ruling center Democratic Party's (PD) already dwindling hopes of staying in power next year as it is opposed by the PD's potential coalition partners.

The deal, struck in February, is popular with the Italian public and with right-wing and anti-establishment parties now ahead in opinion polls, but it has drawn criticism from the United Nations, rights groups and many on Italy's left.

Under the accord, Italy and the European Union pledged to finance migrant camps in Libya, and Rome also agreed to train the Libyan coastguard, part of a crackdown on migrants attempting the hazardous sea crossing to Europe.

But the deal has also led to tens of thousands of migrants being trapped in Libya, where humanitarian groups say they are locked up in appalling conditions, bought and sold, and subjected to crimes on a daily basis.

One politician who wants changes to the agreement is Emma Bonino, a former foreign minister in a center government.

""I've always criticized this agreement with Libya. It's a cork in a bottle that cannot hold,"" Bonino told Reuters.

""Italians have the perception that they are being invaded by Muslim foreigners. It's not true. Fear is fantastic for winning elections, but it's simply useless for controlling migration.""

Bonino is considering forming a pro-EU party with other left-leaning figures that could support the PD ahead of next year's national election, which must be held by May.

In other criticism of the Libya deal, Giulio Marcon, the top lawmaker in the lower house for the Italian Left party, said: ""We cannot be complicit in migrant push backs.""

Left-wing voters hold humanitarian values dear, said Marcon, whose party has so far refused an alliance with the PD.

ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTIES GAINING

The PD needs the support of other parties, on the left in particular. It trailed the populist 5-Star Movement in a recent poll with 24 percent to 29 percent, while a center coalition that includes the anti-immigrant Northern League, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the far-right Brothers of Italy has combined support totaling about 36 percent.

The deal with Libya, modeled on a similar one struck between the EU and Turkey, has been successful in reducing the flow of migrants into Italy, with arrivals down by about a third so far this year compared to the same period in 2016. In October alone arrivals were down about 80 percent from a year earlier.

Ordinary Italians, alarmed by the arrival of some 600,000 migrants in the past four years, have welcomed the trend. An SWG poll this month showed two thirds of Italians do not want more immigrants, fearing they will take away jobs and increase crime.

The Northern League, tapping into the anti-immigrant mood, has seen its popularity more than double to about 15 percent in three years. Its leader, Matteo Salvini, has accused ""fake refugees"" of ""invading"" Italy and bringing crime with them.

Not to be outdone, the 5-Star Movement's candidate for prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, this summer accused charity ships rescuing migrants piled onto overcrowded and unseaworthy boats of being a ""taxi service"".

Under the February deal, Libya's coastguard has so far picked up about 20,000 migrants, including refugees. They are then forced into detention centers where they can be held indefinitely.

Last week the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the EU's support for the Libyan coastguard as ""inhuman"" because intercepted migrants were imprisoned and subjected to ""unimaginable horrors"".

Former U.N. secretary-general and Nobel Peace Prize winner Kofi Annan said the Libya deal suggested Italy was complicit in a breach of the Geneva Convention, which says refugees cannot be returned to a place where they may be persecuted.

""Under the Convention, you cannot push them (refugees) back. But if you make an arrangement with somebody else to keep them from moving, in a way you are complicit,"" Annan said during a trip to Rome this month.",Reuters,energy,,"['Libya', 'Italy', 'Rome', 'Turkey']",Italian left's efforts to stop migrants may backfire at election,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-italy-idUSKBN1DM1JA,None,
11401640,2017-11-21,"TUNIS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Libya's Waha Oil Co is producing about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd), up more than 100,000 bpd from the company's output levels this summer, but further gains are complicated by a lack of investment, its chairman said on Tuesday.

Ahmed Ammar said Waha was aiming to increase output to 375,000 bpd by the end of next year but was facing major funding shortfalls and challenges in maintaining damaged infrastructure.

Waha is a subsidiary of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) and operates as a joint venture with Hess Corp, Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips.

Its oil is exported through Es Sider terminal, which reopened late last year after an armed group that was blockading the port was forced out.

Waha's gains have helped raise Libya's national oil output to around one million bpd, about four times higher than the OPEC member's production in mid-2016.

It remains well below the 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing before a 2011 uprising, and vulnerable to continuing political and economic turmoil.

Plans to increase Waha's production to as high as 600,000 bpd over the next five years, partly through major new projects at the NC-98 and Jalo North fields, have been postponed because of a lack of funding, Ammar told Reuters on the sidelines of a business conference in Tunis.

But he said some gains could be made by developing drilling in fields that are already in production and replacing pumps that were damaged after long output stoppages.

""Some of the production will come from existing wells. We need to work them over,"" Ammar said.

Some of Waha's fields and facilities have been badly damaged in militant attacks, fighting and looting.

At Es Sider, 12 out of 19 storage tanks remain out of use. Ammar said this was not hampering exports, but would become a constraint if the company raised its production towards 400,000 bpd.

Waha hopes to rebuild two of the storage tanks next year, adding storage capacity of one million barrels, but Ammar said approval for the project from Libya's Audit Bureau was still pending.

Waha has also suffered repeated leaks in its pipeline network, which was damaged by highly corrosive water. In one pipeline there were 57 leaks in a single month, Ammar said.

The company has been patching up or clamping pipes but needs to replace or upgrade sections of its network, which is much more expensive.

""Our major issue now at Waha in the existing facilities is the pipelines,"" Ammar said. ""They require a lot of funding.""

11401641,2017-10-04,"TRIPOLI/LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Production at Libya's giant Sharara oilfield was resuming on Wednesday morning, three days after it was closed by an armed brigade, the head of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said.

The field, which had been pumping more than 230,000 barrels per day (bpd), began its restart at around 8 a.m. local time, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Reuters.

He gave no details on how the restart had been achieved. Sharara was shut late on Sunday night by an armed brigade that issued a series of demands over salaries and other claims.

An engineer at the field said preparations for the restart were still being made early on Wednesday and that production would resume gradually.

Force majeure on loadings of Sharara crude was expected to be lifted later on Wednesday, a Libyan oil source said.

Production at Sharara has been repeatedly disrupted this year due to blockades by armed groups, protests and security problems.

The field, which has been producing up to 280,000 bpd, is crucial to a partial revival of Libya's oil output. The North African state had been pumping around one million bpd before the latest shutdown, Sanalla said.

11401642,2017-09-24,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six U.S. air strikes on an Islamic State desert camp in Libya killed 17 militants and destroyed three vehicles, the U.S. military said on Sunday.

U.S Africa Command said in a statement that strikes on Friday targeted a camp 150 miles (240 km) southeast of Sirte, a city that was once its stronghold in Libya. The camp was used to move fighters in and out of Libya, plot attacks and store weapons, the statement said.

""ISIS and al-Qaeda have taken advantage of ungoverned spaces in Libya to establish sanctuaries for plotting, inspiring and directing terror attacks,"" the statement said, using an acronym for Islamic State.

Islamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city. The group imposed its hardline rule on residents and extended its control along about 155 miles (250 km) of Libya's Mediterranean coastline.

But it struggled to keep a footing elsewhere in Libya and by last December was forced out of Sirte after a six-month campaign led by brigades from the western city of Misrata and backed by U.S. air strikes.

11401643,2017-09-20,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations launched a roadmap on Wednesday for a renewed international effort to break a political stalemate in Libya and end the turmoil that followed the country's 2011 uprising.

The world body's Libya envoy, Ghassan Salame, set out an ""action plan"" on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York that proposes amending a 2015 peace deal that quickly stalled.

The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) established under the December 2015 deal never fully materialized in Tripoli, leaving Libya with three competing governments aligned with rival armed alliances.

""I am also convinced that today there is an opportunity to end a protracted crisis that has caused immense suffering and contributed to the instability beyond Libya's borders. We must all seize this moment,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in an address to key stakeholders.

Hamstrung by internal splits in its nine-member leadership, or Presidency Council, the GNA has been unable to tackle Libya's acute liquidity crisis, save collapsing public services or bring powerful militias to heel.

Though oil production has partly recovered and local forces ousted Islamic State from its North African stronghold of Sirte last year, security vacuums in central and southern Libya persist and armed groups control the informal economy.

Eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar has gradually strengthened his position on the ground, with support from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

Lauded by allies for his anti-Islamist stance, Haftar is accused by foes of seeking to reimpose military rule that they fought to overthrow when they toppled veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi six years ago.

GNA Prime Minister Fayez Seraj said he wanted Salame to send a clear message to message to those who could try to subvert the process and make it clear that the GNA was the only party that should be dealt with.

Salame, who took up his post in August, proposed reducing the unwieldy GNA Presidency Council to three members and having it then nominate a new transitional government.

""The action plan was not designed by me, but by the Libyans. They want an inclusive process, a way forward which clearly defines stages and objectives,"" he said.

Salame said the drafting of the plan would begin next week before the convening of a national conference for all key Libyan actors to join the political process.

Securing changes to the 2015 deal would need the approval of a barely functional eastern-based parliament.

The European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on the head of that parliament, Agila Saleh, accusing him of stalling Libya's political process.

A delegation from the eastern parliament is expected to start negotiating with members of its Tripoli-based rival assembly. They are under pressure to reach an agreement before Dec. 17, when opponents of the 2015 deal say it expires.

Salame, who appeared to suggest a new calendar of a year for the process, must also balance calls for new elections with the need to prepare a legal framework in which they can take place.

Elections would require an electoral law, and possibly a referendum, to endorse a new constitution. In 2014, elections were challenged, leading to a major escalation of conflict and the division of Libya's key institutions.

France, Britain and Italy, who have all at some point tried to assert their influence in recent weeks, said they were fully on board with Salame's plans.

11401645,2017-07-29,"CAIRO/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Standing beside French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris this week, Khalifa Haftar, the most powerful military leader in eastern Libya, was smiling when he shook on a deal with the country's prime minister for a ceasefire and Spring elections.

But hours later and away from the diplomatic stage, Haftar exposed the reality of deep fractures in Libya's political landscape, saying any ceasefire was limited, he actually had no interest in elections and Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's power-sharing council was in the grip of terrorists.

Keen to expand the French role in ending Libya's crisis, Macron had applauded the moment as a powerful act for peace among the country's rival armed factions who have skirmished over the oil-producing desert state since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Getting the rivals together for only the second time may have been an achievement. But Haftar's subsequent remarks were a reality check on the complexities of uniting Libya's fractious players and delivering on the ground after years of failed Western efforts to end the crisis.

The Paris deal was meant to revive a stalled U.N.-brokered deal to end the chaos in the OPEC state that has allowed Islamist militants and people smugglers safe haven, risking regional instability and opening up a flow of illegal migrants across the Mediterranean.

Yet Paris excluded key stakeholders, left major differences about Haftar's role to resolve later and, said Middle East analysts, risked emboldening Haftar further in his military campaign by appearing to bolster his international legitimacy over rivals.

Libya's war is on multiple fronts. Haftar has been battling in the east against an alliance of Islamist militants and ex-rebels in Benghazi and carrying out air strikes on armed groups in Derna.

Clashes among rival brigades sometimes break out over private feuds, but this year, heavy shelling and fighting has erupted several times between forces allied to a previous government and brigades backing Serraj.

Haftar had rejected Serraj's U.N.-backed presidential council, even saying some members belonged to al Qaeda.

The commander brands most opponents Islamist militants to be defeated as his self-styled Libyan National Army gains ground backed by powerful allies: Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the United Arab Emirates and Russia.

""The ceasefire is just with moderate parties and youths who have some misdemeanors, we're in contact with them,"" he told France24 Arabic. ""I do not care about elections. I care about the future of Libya as a stable and civil state.""

Past attempts to negotiate peace in Libya have been undone by splits within each faction, who are often loose alliances of convenience among brigades of former rebels more loyal to cities, regions or tribes than to the idea of a Libyan nation.

Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally who lived in exile in the United States for years, has gained momentum, winning over Islamist rivals in Benghazi and taking over key oil ports in a combination of military force and tribal negotiations.

He now hints at pushing closer to the capital of Tripoli. But he still is far from a unifying figure even in the east.

Serraj, meanwhile, has struggled to extend his own influence, and is widely seen as powerless. He is loosely backed by most of the Misrata western brigades but opposed by other armed groups even within Tripoli. The Misrata brigades despise Haftar as a would-be ""military warlord"".

""The outcome of the summit, particularly if it's nothing more than a handshake, could tip the balance in favor of the war faction within Haftar's camp,"" said Mattia Toaldo, Libya expert at the European Council of Foreign Relations.

After Gaddafi fell six years ago in a NATO-backed uprising, former rebel brigades who once fought together to oust the autocrat turned against each other in a struggle for control.

Two years ago, Libya had two competing governments and parliaments, one in the east and one in Tripoli after a battle to capture the capital in 2014.

The U.N.-backed agreement over a unity government has been the main focus of negotiations since.

Diplomats say that despite what Haftar said afterwards, the fact that he agreed in principle the best way forward was a political deal, elections and a ceasefire would help to advance U.N. negotiations.

""All those are steps forward,"" said one diplomat close to the talks. ""There is room to maneuver here. Neither Haftar nor Serraj can deliver on the ground. It is up to the U.N.-led process.""

Still to be resolved though are major differences over the make-up of the presidential council, the role of civilian control over any future Libyan military, and what position Haftar might take in the government of unity.

""I will never be a part of the Presidential Council, never be on the side of terrorist groups,"" Haftar told French television, referring to members of the council he dismissed as linked to al Qaeda or Islamic State.

Yet, hardliners on both sides are unlikely to be convinced by Paris. Serraj's government was supposed to get a vote of approval from the eastern parliament. That never happened. Remnants of a former Islamist-led government also oppose Serraj in Tripoli.

The Justice and Construction Party - the Libyan political wing of Muslim Brotherhood -- dismissed Paris as a distraction and demanded any amendments to the political deal be through the United Nations not through deals with individual countries.

France took a leading role in the NATO air campaign that helped rebels topple Gaddafi in 2011, but his demise tipped the country into years of chaos.

Macron's approach has also caused tensions inside the European Union, with Italy upset. Rome previously took the lead in efforts to bring peace to its former colony, throwing its weight behind Serraj and viewing Haftar with scepticism.

Meanwhile, Haftar was immediately praised by staunch ally Cairo. After the Paris talks, Egypt's foreign minister stressed the need to enhance the role of Haftar's Libyan National Army as one of the institutions to expand and restore security.

""Haftar has the tendency to call anyone who opposes him a terrorist,"" said Geoff Porter at North Africa Risk Consulting. ""This leaves a lot of people outside the parameters of the ceasefire.""",Reuters,energy,,"['Paris', 'Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Derna, Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Russia', 'France', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Egypt', 'Cairo', 'Rome', 'Italy']",Paris hand-shakes on Libya peace deal mask deep fractures,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-idUSKBN1AD26C,None,

11401648,2017-06-09,"LONDON OPEC's battle against an oil glut is under threat as unsold crude from members Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from a global production-cutting deal, is swamping the Atlantic Basin.

Nigeria has more than 60 million barrels of unsold crude, traders of its oil said, surpassing the level reached when global oversupply peaked two years ago. More export plans are a week away, likely bringing more than 50 million extra barrels.

Libya, meanwhile, is pouring nearly triple the amount of crude into global markets compared with last year.

Few expected the two nations' output to rebound so quickly, and it could scupper OPEC's plans to lift oil prices out of a nearly three-year-long slump.

The 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries two weeks ago extended a deal struck in December with several non-member oil producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from levels seen late last year.

But OPEC also renewed exemptions for Libya and Nigeria, which have struggled with output-sapping internal conflict. Those struggles, however, are abating.

""They've added 600,000 barrels per day between the two of them"" since the original deal was struck, said Amrita Sen of consultancy Energy Aspects. ""And that's half the OPEC cuts.""

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) this week lifted force majeure on Nigeria's Forcados crude, bringing the country's oil exports fully online for the first time in 16 months and cementing the addition of some 250,000 bpd to world markets.

Libyan oil production hit its highest since October 2014 at 835,000 bpd this month, despite the brief shutdown of Sharara, the country's largest oilfield, due to protests.

Despite this, OPEC sources said calls to bring Libya or Nigeria into the cuts never garnered enough support. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said this month it was too early for those countries to be considered for output curbs.

But the excess is palpable - and it's pouring straight into the Atlantic Basin, home of the physical crude grades that underpin the global Brent benchmark.

""In a physical sense, it's pretty dire,"" one West African oil trader said. ""Everything is on offer, and everything is pumping.""

Traders said some Mediterranean refiners - typically reliable consumers - were reselling their oil.

A Mediterranean trader said that while Libya ""is not a totally reliable source"", its production was ""running high on several fields"".

There are doubts over whether the two nations will maintain their run, particularly given Libya's political problems.

But Brent futures LCOc1 are trading nearly 20 percent below their 2017 high, and more than 10 percent below the level before the May OPEC meeting.

""The biggest issue is light, sweet crude,"" Sen said, adding the Atlantic Basin is ""awash"" with it. ""This is where OPEC isn't light enough on its feet ... the benchmarks are all light sweet. And the cuts are medium and sour.""

Even barrels from the United States are sailing east, looking for homes in Europe and Asia and further undermining the global benchmark. The dynamic, traders and analysts said, pointed to a need for more from OPEC.

""This means the rest of the group will see the call on their crude falling - it's very simple,"" FGE analyst James Davis said. ""They need to cut deeper in order to maintain the status quo.""

11401651,2017-03-02,"TRIPOLI In a cluster of luxury residences that survived Tripoli's battles almost unscathed, a self-declared defender of Libya's revolution has set up base as one of three claimants to the country's premiership.

A handful of guards and two armored white SUVs are stationed at Khalifa Ghwell's compound, and loyalists control surrounding roads with checkpoints and patrols.

Few consider Ghwell a serious contender for power. But in recent weeks the ex-prime minister has bolstered his presence at his base four km from the heart of the capital, in an increasingly brazen challenge aimed at undermining a U.N.-backed government that was meant to shepherd Libya toward peace.

Six years after the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi's over 40-year rule, Ghwell's reappearance and his ability to mobilize powerful armed support have set the capital on edge, leading to some unusually violent fighting.

They expose Libya's deep fractures and how little traction Western efforts have gained in stabilizing the oil-producing desert state.

Libya remains a byword for chaos. The North African country has more than doubled oil output to 700,000 barrels per day in recent months, though this is well below the more than 1.6 million bpd it pumped before Libya's 2011 uprising.

That recovery and gains against Islamic State are fragile. The south and west are criss-crossed with smuggler routes, and armed brigades skirmish in turf wars on the streets of Tripoli.

In the capital, Prime Minister Fayez Seraj's U.N.-endorsed Government of National Accord (GNA) has drifted half-formed, largely unable to provide services to despairing citizens or exert authority even on its doorstep, as Libya's neighbors and Western states scramble to salvage their plan.

In the east of the country another premier also lays claim to power from the city of Bayda, backed by a parliament that sits in Tobruk, near the border with Egypt. It won international recognition but is now largely inactive.

They are aligned to an anti-Islamist figurehead, Khalifa Haftar, who is based in the town of Marj and whose forces have long been fighting for control of the nearby city of Benghazi. Haftar has been nominating military governors and threatening to move on Tripoli, emboldened by support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.

Haftar's forces control most of Libya's oil, and cooperate with the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation despite earlier attempts by eastern factions to sell oil independently.

Divisions that flared into conflict across Libya in 2014 have not healed. Ghwell himself was installed by an Islamist-leaning alliance of former rebels that won control of Tripoli that year from groups aligned with Haftar. Their alliance then fractured, complicating an already messy political landscape.

Since the GNA stalled, Ghwell has been trying to rebuild his position with support from his home city of Misrata.

""What has this government achieved during this year?"" Ghwell asked during a rare interview with Reuters, speaking in a wood-paneled office in a complex built by Gaddafi for favored functionaries.

""Unfortunately the international community sees the results of their support. We thank them for their work but the result is very negative. If they persist with this, nothing will change.""

In an example of the bewildering nature of the country's post-revolt politics, he says he is now in contact with the eastern-based government aligned with Haftar, trying to strike a deal over the heads of the GNA that they both oppose.

But he says if Haftar tried to seize power in the capital, he would be outgunned. ""We are ready for this,"" Ghwell said.

A year ago, Ghwell tried and failed to prevent the GNA leadership from even getting to Tripoli. He shut down the air space over Tripoli, but was outmaneuvered when Seraj traveled from Tunisia by ship in late March, landing at a naval base that is still his headquarters.

Ghwell accuses the GNA of trying to impose itself without popular backing, creating further layers of institutional confusion and overseeing a steady decline in living standards.

His entourage moved into the residential complex, and a parliament building where a pro-GNA body had been sitting, in October. In January, he announced he had taken back a number of ministries. He says he now has authority over ""about six"", including defense, justice and ""50 percent of the interior ministry"" - a claim the GNA dismisses. They say Ghwell makes fleeting appearances at unoccupied official buildings.

But the limits of GNA control are clear. Its nine leaders, or Presidential Council (PC), were meant to unite Libya's political currents and its regions, east, west and south, but have often amplified those splits.

Two members with ties to Haftar and his allies have almost entirely boycotted the council, and others have frequently clashed, issuing contradictory statements and making apparently unilateral appointments, often announced late at night.

Seraj's frequent absences at international meetings and summits have fueled criticism that his government is dependent on foreign support and barely visible on the ground.

Western powers eagerly promoted the GNA as a partner, and the PC gradually tried to put its ministers to work. But without the endorsement of the eastern parliament - a key step in the U.N.-backed political accord - they are left in limbo.

Seraj has claimed credit for victory over Islamic State in its former stronghold of Sirte and for boosting oil production, but both were driven by forces largely outside his control.

The international community has coaxed a reluctant central bank to release funding to the GNA, which has in turn struggled to operate. Few resources trickle down, even to ministers.

Iman Ben Younis, a minister in charge of building and reforming state institutions, has just three employees, all of them volunteers at her office in the prime ministerial building.

Otman Gajiji, who resigned as head of Libya's municipal elections committee because his staff had not been paid for two years, said mayors who backed the GNA were fed up.

""They're losing faith, some of them have informed me that they will withdraw their support,"" he said.

Ahmed Maiteeg, a deputy prime minister, says the PC has some spending power after the central bank recently releasing budget money. He said he was untroubled by Ghwell, whose instructions ""don't go further than his secretary"".

Maiteeg said the GNA's role was to ""maintain the peace"" between Libyans, and brigades of former rebels that divide up the capital - some with semi-official status - will be given economic opportunities and return to civilian life.

But engaging armed groups is not easy. Militiamen kidnap civilians for ransom, force banks to hand over cash, and steal electricity to save their neighborhoods from power cuts.

In recent battles armed groups have coalesced into pro- and anti-GNA factions, the latter spurred on in weekly addresses by Libya's grand mufti, an influential figure for some brigades.

The anti-GNA side was recently reinforced by a convoy of military vehicles that arrived in the capital from Misrata, sparking fresh clashes. Last week they were blamed for firing on Seraj's motorcade as it passed close to Ghwell's compound.

11401652,2017-02-09,"Western states say the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) provides the best chance of reversing Libya's slide into anarchy and warfare. However, the GNA has largely failed to exert its authority over a country that slid into lawlessness after the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.

""There is I must say a growing consensus to adapt the composition of the Presidency Council,"" Martin Kobler, the special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in Libya, told Reuters in an interview.

""We opened the way for a limited amendment to the Libyan political agreement but it must be a Libyan-owned and a Libyan-steered process,"" said Kobler, who spoke after giving a Security Council briefing at U.N. headquarters in New York.

The GNA's leadership, the Presidential Council, is made up of nine members who are meant to represent different geographical regions and political currents within Libya.

The Council has been bitterly divided, with two of its number mostly boycotting proceedings, and different members regularly issuing contradictory statements.

Khalifa Haftar, a prominent commander in eastern Libya who harbors national ambitions and once fought beside long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi, is a figurehead for factions in the country's east. He has shunned the GNA.

""The single most important topic is the construction of a Libyan united army with a clear chain of command, where general Haftar must have a role,"" Kobler said.

He said had met Haftar once but has not had another meeting since then. Haftar has had renewed engagement with Russia at a time when the GNA is in crisis.

""I just came now from Moscow ... the Russians have a close relation(ship) to Haftar, so there is no lack of communication,"" Kobler said.

Kobler said he has not yet had contact with the new U.S. administration.

""If the Trump administration asks for a meeting I would love to meet (them). But I take it that it takes some time in order to get organized after the change of government.""

Kobler said the U.N. was actively working on reopening its office in Tripoli, following similar moves from the Italian and Turkish embassies there last month.

""We are reinforcing the place, and building,"" said Kobler, adding the return will be ""in the foreseeable future.""

11401653,2017-02-03,"VALLETTA European Union leaders meet on Malta on Friday to endorse plans they hope can forestall a new wave spring of migrants sailing for Italy from Africa, but aware that anarchy in Libya means any quick fix is a long shot.

Theresa May will also attend, despite the prime minister's plan to start negotiations by next month to take the U.K. out of the EU -- a reminder that Britain, along with France, is one of the bloc's two main military powers and a key aid donor in Africa, and that Brussels will go on cooperating with London long after Brexit.

May also has a chance to brief her 27 peers on her visit last week to new U.S. President Donald Trump, whose backing for Brexit, doubts on free trade, barring of refugees and warmth toward Russia all raise alarm in Europe. The British leader could feel a degree of frost over her rush to embrace Trump.

A controversial agreement with Turkey last year halted an influx of refugees that had brought a million migrants into Germany via Greece. Now the EU has turned its attention to Italy, where a record 181,000 people arrived in 2016, most of them deemed to be seeking work and not in clear need of asylum from persecution.

The risks that those people run in the seas around Malta after crossing the Sahara -- more than 4,500 drowned last year -- will be highlighted when leaders renew vows to help Africans live better without leaving home: ""This is the only way to stop people dying in the desert and at sea,"" summit chair Donald Tusk said. ""The only way to gain control over migration in Europe.""

Popular hostility to immigration has stoked nationalist, anti-EU movements, creating a powerful incentive for leaders facing re-election to appear to be control. That includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who wants a fourth term in September.

EU leaders acknowledge they cannot replicate with Libya the deal they made with Turkey to take back asylum-seekers. As the U.N. refugee agency reminded them on Thursday, Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 is simply not a safe place.

""There will be no bazooka,"" a senior EU official said on Thursday, ruling out -- at this stage -- that the bloc could get more directly involved in handling asylum seekers inside Africa.

That leaves the EU trying to bolster the shaky, U.N.-backed Tripoli government of Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, who was in Brussels and Rome on Thursday to hear pledges of cash and help to train and strengthen his coastal and border forces.

As well as trying to disrupt smuggling gangs, the EU aims to deport more failed asylum seekers from Italy, using its cash to overcome resistance among African states to taking people back. Deportations may never occur on a grand scale, but EU officials argue that a more visible risk of being deported may dissuade would-be migrants from setting out in the first place.

""But everyone understands that this is a long shot,"" one senior EU diplomat said.

Other deterrence, including publicizing the unhappy fate of many migrants, may be having an effect. In Agadez in Niger, the numbers gathering to cross the Sahara have plunged lately -- though smugglers may just have altered routes.

11401924,2017-10-18,"* Production seen to reach ceiling around one million BPD

* Output fluctuating due to protests, lack of maintenance

* Oil revenues not enough to reverse economic slide (Updates with NOC comment)

By Aidan Lewis and Ahmed Elumami

TUNIS/TRIPOLI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Libya's oil production revival is being undermined by the same financial, economic and security problems that threaten the promise of stability and a better life for the divided North African nation.

Libya surprised many observers when it managed to raise its output fourfold to around one million barrels per day (bpd), boosting its only significant source of income.

Continued disruptions by a range of local groups demanding a share of the revenues, as well as a lack of funds for maintenance and investment, are preventing the National Oil Corporation (NOC) from consolidating those gains, oil officials, engineers at the major fields and analysts say.

NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said last week that the corporation had only received a quarter of its 2017 budget, making a previously announced target of 1.25 million bpd by the end of the year ""very difficult"" to achieve.

Without sufficient investment, output would dip, he warned. ""You can lose production at any time.""

One problem is that many of the gains made over the past year were relatively easy and cheap, said Riccardo Fabiani, a senior analyst at Eurasia Group.

""Now the problem in the east and other parts of the oil infrastructure is that you need more serious work to repair some of the facilities, so it's more expensive, it's technically more challenging ... and the additional volumes that will come out of that repair work are going to be more limited,"" he said.

Fabiani predicted production is likely to hover between 700,000 and one million bpd in the short term.

Shutdowns have been caused mainly by armed groups making demands for their members, sometimes claiming to act on behalf of local communities seeking jobs and public services, but also by peaceful civic groups protesting economic hardships since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

Sanalla has said repeatedly he will not negotiate with or make concessions to blockaders and has threatened to prosecute them, although the NOC also tries to support communities near oil facilities and develop relationships with them.

Limited resources and persistent lawlessness in a country split between rival political factions mean the NOC struggles to meet expectations, however.

""The National Oil Corporation is keen to preserve production but at the same time it's a part of the problem,"" said Ghaith Salem al-Rooq, a negotiator from Zintan who took part in talks to reopen blockaded pipelines near the western town.

""They have been making promises to those who shut down the fields, but never fulfilled their promises.""

In a statement to Reuters, the NOC said Rooq was not involved in the final negotiations that led to reopening the Zintan pipelines and maintained that no promises were made.

""All blockades have been lifted unconditionally,"" it said.

Production at the southwestern Sharara field, which can pump up to 280,000 bpd, or more than a quarter of the country's total output, is a frequent target of blockades.

In the most recent incident, an armed group forced a two-day shutdown at Sharara in early October to demand salary payments, fuel supplies and the release of members that it said had been detained.

A new group called ""Enough Silence"", made up of young people from six districts in southern Libya, has said it will peacefully blockade supply roads to Sharara to lobby for oil revenues to be spent on the neglected south.

""The problems are endless,"" a spokesman for the movement, Mohamed Hamouzi, told Reuters by phone.

""We are talking about severe lack of medical, educational, and security services. There's no liquidity at all,"" he said, referring to severe cash shortages in banks across Libya.

""If our demands for solving these problems are not met we are going to shut down Sharara within two weeks.""

On Wednesday, a group of Gaddafi loyalists posted a video of four men standing over a pipeline at an unnamed desert location, threatening to cut supplies of oil and gas to terminals in the Zawiya refinery and Mellitus complex on Libya's northern coast within 72 hours if one of their leaders was not released from jail in Tripoli.

With the largest proven oil reserves in Africa, pumping more than 1.6 million bpd before 2011, Libya's production is closely watched. Along with Nigeria, it has been exempted from OPEC-led production cuts.

Adding to uncertainty are political divisions that the United Nations is trying to mend.

A current U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has been eroded by internal splits, lack of technical capacity and rejection by factions that control the eastern part of the country. It has also not been able to reverse a sharp decline in living standards or disband the many locally-rooted armed groups that hold sway in western Libya.

The World Bank projects a budget deficit this year of 22 percent, despite oil exports rising to an average of 0.62 million bpd from January to July.

Almost all public spending goes on state salaries and subsidising basic products including imported fuel, more than 30 percent of which is smuggled back out of the country, according to NOC estimates.

Even without the disruptions, oil revenues would still not be high enough to resolve the economic troubles that many blockaders say they are protesting over.

11401926,2017-10-04,"TRIPOLI/LONDON (Reuters) - Production at Libya's giant Sharara oilfield resumed on Wednesday after an armed brigade forced a two-day shutdown, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said.

Operations at Sharara, which is crucial to a partial revival of Libya's oil output, have been repeatedly disrupted this year due to blockades by armed groups, protests and security problems.

As production resumed, the NOC lifted force majeure on loadings of Sharara crude from Zawiya port, where the tanker Seaways Hatteras was due to load a 130,000 tonne cargo, according to shipping fixtures and a Libyan oil source.

Sharara, which the NOC operates in partnership with oil companies Repsol, Total, OMV and Statoil, was shut on Sunday night by an armed group called Brigade 30, which issued a series of demands. They included requests for salary payments, fuel supplies and the release of members of the group that it said had been detained.

The field, which had been pumping more than 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) immediately before the shutdown, restarted at around 8 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) on Wednesday, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Reuters.

The NOC did not say how the dispute had been resolved, but it thanked the head of the guard force tasked with protecting Sharara as well as senior figures from the Tuareg ethnic group for helping to restart the field.

The restart of production at Sharara added to pressure on oil prices on Wednesday, which slipped amid concerns that a recent rally had been overdone. [O/R]

The NOC said losses from the closure were estimated at more than $27 million.

An engineer at the field confirmed that production had resumed.

The field has been producing up to 280,000 bpd in recent months. The North African state had been pumping around one million bpd before the latest shutdown, Sanalla said, about four times more than in mid-2016.

Libya's production has fluctuated sharply due to action by armed groups, political disputes and damage to oil infrastructure. Before the country's 2011 uprising, it stood at about 1.6 million bpd.

11401927,2017-08-29,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Heavy rains from tropical storm Harvey caused large-scale U.S. refinery outages, pushing up gasoline prices, while crude prices rose in early Asian trade on Tuesday on the back of supply disruptions in Colombia and Libya.

Refinery shutdowns from the storm helped push U.S. gasoline prices to 2015 highs of $1.7799 per gallon on Monday, although they receded slightly to $1.7325 per gallon by 0103 GMT on Tuesday.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 23 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $46.80 a barrel, after falling more than 2 percent in the previous session.

On international oil markets, Brent crude futures were up 17 cents or 0.3 percent, at $52.06 per barrel.

Massive floods caused by Harvey forced several refineries to close along the U.S. Gulf Coast, while heavy rains were spreading into the greater Houston area, which has already been hit by catastrophic flooding.

The U.S. refinery sector was affected much more than oil producers by the hurricane, which has now been downgraded to a tropical storm. Sources have told Reuters Motiva will decide on Tuesday morning (local time) whether to shut the 603,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur refinery, the nation's largest, because of high water in the plant.

""Data available so far point to sizably larger refining than production disruptions,"" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.

""We roughly estimate that the impact of Harvey on the U.S. oil market would be to increase domestic crude availability by 1.4 million bpd while removing 615,000-785,000 bpd of gasoline and 700,000 of distillate supplies. Larger refinery outages would increase these long crude and short product impacts,"" Goldman said.

In crude markets, the focus was more on disruptions in Libya and also Colombia.

In Libya, the 120,000 bpd Zawiya oil refinery was working at only half its capacity due to the shutdown at the Sharara oilfield, according to a refinery source.

Sharara, which at 280,000 bpd is the OPEC member's largest oilfield, has been shut for around a week due to militia blocking a pipeline linking it to the Zawiya oil terminal.

In Colombia, a bomb attack by leftist ELN rebel group has halted pumping operations along the country's second-largest oil pipeline, the Cano-Limon Covenas, sources from the military and state oil company Ecopetrol said.

By Aidan Lewis

SHARARA OIL FIELD, Libya, July 20 (Reuters) - When the head of Libya's state energy company visited Sharara oil field in early July, community leaders and workers crowded into a conference room to ask about jobs, training and services for local people.

When, they asked, would their villages start to see the benefit of the country's rising oil production?

""You've been very patient,"" Mustafa Sanalla reassured them, before adding: ""You need to be patient a little longer.""

Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) raised output to more than one million barrels per day (bpd) at the end of June for the first time since 2013, a feat that seemed near impossible after the chaos that followed the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The NOC did it by cajoling community leaders, shaming blockaders and navigating a bewildering range of tribal feuds as it reopened fields and patched up infrastructure.

But the comeback, crucial to Libya's survival, is fragile.

To keep it going, NOC chief Sanalla has to tour the country regularly, placating restive armed factions and local groups while at the same time tussling with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli over budget and control over the oil sector.

Even if the NOC can continue to stop the port and field blockades that crippled Libya's production in recent years, its goal of pushing production to 1.25 million bpd later this year will be difficult to achieve.

Output is already wavering due to problems linked to long shutdowns and a lack of maintenance and investment.

Idled pipelines have corroded, thieves have stolen copper wiring at desert oil facilities. No new drilling has been done for three years and few foreign contractors have returned. Funds to replace and maintain infrastructure are badly needed.

""Unless we have the money, not only can we not increase production, we cannot sustain production,"" Sanalla told Reuters as he flew back from the visit to Sharara and another southwestern field called El Feel. ""Until now we haven't received one penny.""

Among the parties closely watching the situation is OPEC, which wants to bolster global oil prices. OPEC exempted members Libya and Nigeria from a deal to cut output that took effect in January, but the group is now considering if and when quickly rising production should be capped.

Sanalla will share his production plans at a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers in Russia on Saturday.

Libya has the biggest proven oil reserves in Africa. Before the uprising that killed Gaddafi, it was pumping around 1.6 million bpd, much of it light, sweet crude shipped to Europe.

From 2013, however, shutdowns and fighting linked to a messy conflict that spread across the country brought the sector to its knees.

Militia leaders closed ports and pipelines, militants set storage tanks ablaze. Some oil facilities were plundered. Blockades were set up by armed groups demanding salary payments or seeking to cut off a source of government revenues.

A government set up in the east of the country tried, and failed, to sell its own oil through a parallel national oil company in Benghazi.

The NOC in Tripoli survived the conflicts relatively unscathed, emerging as perhaps the only major institution that could function effectively across the country.

Appointed NOC chairman in May 2014, Sanalla and his colleagues travel freely to meet people, unlike the country's politicians who are largely split between east and west and rarely venture beyond their base.

Last summer, with production languishing below 250,000 bpd, Sanalla began a campaign against the blockades, criss-crossing Libya's huge land mass in an eight-seat propeller plane.

""Since last July, for one year, I'm always moving - all the oil fields, all the tribes, all the blockaders. I sit down with all of them and explain the problem,"" said Sanalla, 56, a chemical engineer and former operations manager who has worked at the NOC for more than three decades. ""To solve the problems you need face-to-face dialogue.""

A big breakthrough came in September when Ibrahim Jathran, an armed group leader who had closed several key ports and whom Sanalla vocally denounced, lost control of the terminals to eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar.

Haftar, widely seen to harbour national ambitions, quickly allowed the NOC to reopen the ports and connected fields.

Three months later a two-year blockade on pipelines leading to Sharara and El Feel was lifted near the western town of Zintan, after months of NOC mediation with the factions involved. The fields now account for about of third of Libya's total output.

During Sanalla's visit to El Feel and Sharara, he warmly greeted employees, leaders of the local community and turbaned guards, pausing for selfies and handshakes before leading discussions over local conditions and requests for aid.

At Sharara, Sanalla handed over provisions for the nearby town of Ubari, including hundreds of beds and equipment for schools. A community leader at El Feel said he needed water pumps, petrol stations, football pitches and leisure parks.

Sanalla would not give details about exactly what he has had to promise in his various deals to reopen fields and pipelines. But he insists he has never offered payments.

""The issue is to explain to people today in two oil fields that we have a partnership with the stakeholders,"" Sanalla said. He said his message is ""production is very crucial to you as well, not just to us"".

There are limits and risks to the NOC's strategy.

The Government of National Accord in Tripoli has failed to extend its authority or win over factions in the east since it started governing in March last year, meaning bigger political and security threats to Libya's production still loom.

Relations between the GNA and NOC have also soured over a contract dispute with German oil firm Wintershall, which has two concessions in the east. The NOC accused the government of using the dispute to extend its power over the oil sector and accused Wintershall of colluding with the GNA.

Sanalla says politicians need to stop competing for control of oil resources and give the NOC the budget it needs.

The GNA responds that even with oil output on the rise, funding is limited. According to the central bank, oil revenues are expected to reach 16.6 billion Libyan dinars ($11.4 billion) this year, still well short of the 21 billion dinars ($14.5 billion) needed for state salary payments alone.

Workers and locals remain restless, worn down by years sliding living standards. Even oil employees have trouble accessing salaries.

Sharara, where output is about 270,000 bpd, suffered brief closures when valves were switched off in March and April, and again when staff went on strike after a worker drowned in a swimming pool at the field in June.

El Feel, now pumping about 60,000 bpd, did not open until May because of a protest by guards, who in reality are militiamen with local loyalties.

Sanalla says the NOC is doing what it can for communities near oil facilities, but it takes time.

11401930,2017-03-19,"The loss and recapture of the ports this month by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) had raised doubts over its willingness to let the Tripoli-based NOC manage the ports.

Revenue from the sites is controlled by a central bank and U.N.-backed government in the capital which pro-LNA factions oppose.

Eastern officials accuse rivals in Tripoli and the western city of Misrata of supporting a March 3 attack on the ports by a faction known as the Benghazi Defense Brigades (BDB).

An oil guard commander appointed by the U.N.-backed government was deployed to secure them.

After they were retaken, the head of a Benghazi NOC office appointed by Libya's eastern government said he was pulling out of an NOC unification deal signed in July and an LNA spokesman said there would be no immediate decision on a handover.

But in written responses provided to Reuters, Mustafa Sanalla, the Tripoli-based NOC chairman, said his staff had already been working with the LNA.

""We have been coordinating our assessment of the facilities with them,"" Sanalla said, in his first public comments since the ports were retaken.

""We have no reason to believe control of the ports will not be handed back to NOC.""

Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have a combined potential capacity of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd).

Operations there and at two other ports southwest of Benghazi are crucial to the NOC's efforts to revive Libya's output, which has been crippled by years of conflict and political chaos.

The LNA took over the ports in September, ending a two-year blockade at three of them and quickly inviting the NOC to resume exports.

Es Sider and Ras Lanuf were badly damaged in previous rounds of fighting and have been operating well below normal levels. The latest clashes, which included ground battles and more than a week of LNA air strikes, had dented the LNA's claim it could defend the ports and led to fears that facilities would suffer further damage.

But Waha Oil Company resumed pumping to Es Sider on Saturday and Sanalla said the NOC had decided to restart operations at the ports based on technical assessments and a review by military engineers.

""For the most part, the facilities are not damaged. In one or two locations, some work needs to be done by the military engineers. Our workers are returning to their terminals gradually.""

Reuters journalists observed little apparent additional damage to the ports during a visit on Thursday.

An engineer at the Waha oil field said on Sunday it was pumping 25,000 bpd to Es Sider as it restarted production, which stood at 75,000 bpd before the clashes.

Sanalla said the NOC was hoping to raise overall production to 800,000 bpd by the end of April from 611,000 bpd currently.

Libya along with Nigeria has been exempted from production cuts recently agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

However, any gains in Libya remain fragile as long as the political turmoil that has fractured the country since its 2011 uprising continues.

Oil accounts for nearly all of Libya's income and pipelines and ports have been repeatedly blockaded by local groups seeking political and financial gain.

Eastern authorities have attempted to sell oil independently, but have been blocked by international sanctions which remain in place.

Oil facilities are protected by the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) but PFG units often operate independently or for a particular political faction.

Sanalla said a neutral PFG should have a role, ""but under the authority and real management of NOC"".

""Putting the PFG under the NOC would, we think, go a long way to removing Libya's oil assets as an object of military competition,"" he said.

""Unless oil assets are taken off the table as an object of conflict, unless the oil industry is ring-fenced from our political conflict, then the possibility of more fighting remains.""

* Output from key oil ports threatened (Adds updated oil production figure)

By Aidan Lewis and Ayman al-Warfalli

TUNIS/BENGHAZI, Libya, March 10 Early in the morning, small groups of armed pick-up trucks raced across the desert towards some of Libya's biggest oil export terminals.

A previous attempt by the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) to capture the ports had failed. But the attack last Friday caught the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) by surprise.

The LNA's withdrawal from the ports of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf has dented its claims to military superiority, dimming the prospects for its leader, Khalifa Haftar, to expand his power.

It also opens up a new front between factions battling on and off for power in Libya since 2014, throwing efforts to unite the country and rebuild oil production into deep uncertainty. The North African state is exempt from a recent OPEC deal to limit global supply, and had more than doubled its output in recent months to about 700,000 barrels per day (bpd).

The LNA says it is mobilising for a counter attack, personally overseen by Haftar, against the BDB, the most recent armed faction to contest ports that should account for more than half of the OPEC member's exports.

The BDB says it is seeking a route to Benghazi, from where many of its members had fled in the face of LNA advances against Islamists and other opponents over the past two years.

It says it is fighting for families trapped or displaced by the LNA's military campaign, and to save Libya from a return to dictatorship and protect the revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

""Our main goal is to retake our city, we reject injustice and military rule,"" BDB commander Mustafa al-Sharksi told reporters. ""When we rallied against Gaddafi, we wanted freedom, we wanted to build legitimate institutions, and leaders who would rule the country as those in the developed world do.""

Haftar, a former Gaddafi ally who casts himself as the man to save Libya from the chaos of militia rule, received a big boost in September when he took over Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, as well as Brega and Zueitina, two other terminals on the a strip of coast southwest of Benghazi known as the Oil Crescent.

Peeling away tribal support, Haftar ousted Ibrahim Jathran, a commander of Libya's Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) who had become unpopular for demanding money to end a port blockade.

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) in Tripoli was quickly invited to reopen the ports, and Libya's production more than doubled to 600,000 bpd.

The BDB has also said it will allow the NOC to operate freely, inviting in a PFG head appointed by the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.

Because Es Sider and Ras Lanuf were badly damaged in previous fighting and are operating at far lower levels than Zueitina and Brega, the initial impact on production has been limited. Total output stood at about 620,000 bpd on Thursday, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Reuters.

But the BDB advance has put oil back at the centre of conflict and ambitious NOC plans to revive production may be stalled. The NOC had said it hoped to push output to more than 1 million bpd within months, on the way to pre-conflict output of 1.6 million bpd.

It will now require ""pretty adroit footwork"" by the NOC to sustain such a message, said John Hamilton, a director of Cross Border Information and an expert on Libyan energy.

""What this demonstrates is that Haftar is not able to provide security for the terminals,"" he said. ""How can any ship owners or insurers or oil companies be confident of sending vessels to lift crude, even if Haftar regains them?""

After taking the ports seven months ago, the LNA repelled several attempted counter-attacks with air strikes, and carried out what it said were preemptive strikes against BDB mobilisation in the central desert region of Jufra.

Guards loyal to the LNA said the ports were well secured, and safe for foreign workers to return.

But when the BDB advanced again last Friday, LNA defences were quickly breached. LNA ground forces retreated towards Brega, about 115 km (70 miles) east of Ras Lanuf, and lost more than 30 men, according to medical sources.

There have been daily LNA strikes since, but their impact is unclear.

Sharksi said the BDB had air defence weaponry, claiming LNA pilots ""are scared so they fly at high altitudes"".

Fawzi Boukatef, a rebel leader in Benghazi in 2011 who is in contact with the BDB, said tribal support for Haftar, uncertain in parts of the east, had eroded in the Oil Crescent, and that mercenaries from southern Libya and sub-Saharan Africa who had been operating for the LNA had been bought off.

""Some were paid to leave the area and some were paid to fight on the other side,"" he told Reuters.

The BDB, dismissed as al Qaeda-linked militants by the LNA, in fact have a wide support base, said Anas El Gomati, head of the Sadeq Institute, a Libyan think tank. They are motivated by the desire to get thousands of displaced families back to Benghazi, help those caught in a long siege in the district of Ganfouda, and by recent LNA air strikes in the desert.

""The attacks in Jufra certainly galvanized support for the BDB and created a rallying call against Haftar,"" he said.

Some BDB support comes from Misrata, the western port city that has been a source of military opposition to Haftar and where many displaced families from Benghazi have been living.

Though moderates in Misrata supported a U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and have even been open to a deal with Haftar, fighting in the Oil Crescent risks strengthening hardliners on both sides, analysts say.

Haftar has shunned efforts to revive the U.N. peace process, while accusing elements within the GNA of supporting the BDB. A group of nearly 40 pro-Haftar members of Libya's eastern parliament voted this week to drop support from the GNA's leadership and withdraw from U.N.-mediated dialogue.

The company's total realized price was $32.93 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), 15.4 percent higher a year ago, it said on Thursday.

The Houston-based company's operating costs were down 21.5 percent in the fourth quarter.

Excluding Libya, production was marginally down at 1.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

ConocoPhillips said its production in the first quarter of 2017 would be between 1.54 million-1.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

The company's net loss narrowed to $35 million, or 3 cents per share, in the quarter, from $3.45 billion, or $2.78 per share.

The year-ago quarter included a $2.74 billion charge, while the latest quarter included a gain of $52 million.

On an adjusted basis, ConocoPhillips reported a loss of 26 cents per share, much smaller than the 42 cents analysts estimated, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

11401935,2017-01-12,"NEW YORK Jan 12 U.S. East Coast refiners are in the midst of their biggest buying spree of Algerian crude in years as they take advantage of cheap oil spilling out of the region, traders said on Thursday.

The renewed interest in Algerian crude comes as the country ramped up exports and fellow African OPEC producers Libya and Nigeria have seized on their exemption from global production cuts and turned on their oil spigots, flooding a well-supplied market in need of new customers.

""It's real competitive, and I don't think it's going to stop any time soon,"" said a U.S. East Coast oil trader, of the rise in Algerian imports.

The surge also comes as U.S. East Coast refiners have all-but abandoned domestic crude via rail out of North Dakota in favor of waterborne imports following the collapse of the wide discount CL-LCO1=R U.S. crude enjoyed against the global benchmark Brent, during the outset of the shale revolution in 2011 until the back half of 2015.

In October, U.S. East Coast refiners imported 156,000 barrels per day of Algerian crude, the second-highest monthly tally ever and the most since 2007, the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration figures show. November and December were also active months, after nearly two years of limited buying.

Algeria's crude oil exports hit record highs in October, a source from state-run oil company Sonatrach told Reuters.

The biggest buyers of the October Algerian cargoes were Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Monroe Energy, followed by Phillips 66, EIA data shows. All three are historically big buyers of Bakken crude, which is comparable to North and West African grades.

The buying continued in November and December, with 7,825 bpd and 109,765 bpd, respectively, imported into the East Coast, Reuters shipping data showed.

In the 21 months before October, there were only six months with Algerian imports into the U.S. East Coast; none higher than 41,000 bpd, EIA data shows.

October offers the clearest picture of how oil flows have shifted along the U.S. East Coast - total foreign imports into the region reached 1.07 million bpd, the highest in 59 months, while domestic crude volumes by rail fell to 129,500 bpd, the second-lowest total in 46 months.

Sarah Emerson, managing principal at consultancy ESAI Energy LLC, said she expects African grades to continue to hit the East Coast, particularly as Libya and Nigeria boost production.

""The one thing that helped boost rail into the East Coast was Libya production disappeared. That's not the case any more, and I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing Libyan barrels on the East Coast,"" Emerson said.

11402028,2017-11-28,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - France said on Tuesday it wanted the United Nations Security Council to consider imposing targeted sanctions on human traffickers operating in Libya after a video appearing to show African migrants sold as slaves sparked global outrage.

Several members of the 15-member Security Council expressed their horror at the video during a meeting on Tuesday, requested by France, to discuss human trafficking in Libya. The footage broadcast earlier this month by CNN showed what it said was an auction of men to Libyan buyers as farmhands and sold for $400 each.

French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said the council should use sanctions to help stamp out trafficking in Libya.

""France will propose to assist the sanctions committee ... in identifying responsible individuals and entities for trafficking through Libyan territory,"" Delattre told the council. ""We count upon support of the members of the council to make headway to that end.""

Under a sanctions regime set up in 2011, the Security Council is able to impose a global asset freeze and travel ban on ""individuals and entities involved in or complicit in ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses against persons in Libya.""

France can propose names for targeted U.N. sanctions but needs to win consensus support within the Security Council's 15-member Libya sanctions committee.

Some council members expressed support for the possibility of imposing targeted sanctions, while others backed the council first issuing a statement. Diplomats said France, Britain and Sweden were drafting a statement.

""We all have a responsibility to act. This is not the moment to pass the buck,"" said Sweden's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau.

Libya descended into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 led to the overthrow and killing of leader Muammar Gaddafi, with two competing governments backed by militias scrambling for control of the oil-producing country. Islamic State militants have also gained a foothold in the North African state.

Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and the divided country's eastern commander Khalifa Haftar verbally committed last month to a conditional ceasefire and to work toward holding elections next spring.

""I will be traveling to Libya very soon to ensure the follow-up of this meeting and to get the support of all sides to the declaration that was adopted then,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a speech to French ambassadors.

France, which took a leading role in the NATO air campaign that helped rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi, has sought to play a greater role in Libya, believing diplomatic efforts were stalling and that under President Emmanuel Macron it could fill that void.

Officials fear jihadist groups could try to exploit the power vacuum in Libya to regroup after losing substantial ground in Syria and Iraq, and see a resolution to the conflict as vital to ending Europe's migrant crisis.

""In Libya, France along with others has a specific responsibility to help this country find unity and stability,"" Le Drian said.

Past attempts at peace deals in oil-producing Libya have often been scuttled by internal divisions among the myriad of competing armed groups that have emerged since rebels toppled Gaddafi in 2011.

11402033,2017-06-09,"The feud complicates efforts to stabilize countries reeling from years of turmoil and undermines the notion of a Sunni Muslim Arab world united against terrorism and Iran, proclaimed by U.S. President Donald Trump in his visit last month.

The quarrel is the latest chapter in the battle of wills between political Islamists and traditional Arab autocrats which has buffeted Muslim societies for decades.

Since the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" protests, which aspired to democratic reform but in several countries collapsed into warfare, Egypt and especially the United Arab Emirates emerged as main foes of an ascendant Muslim Brotherhood backed by Qatar.

After Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE cut ties to Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting militants and Iran, regional allies followed suit and denounced domestic foes as Qatari stooges, undermining reconciliation efforts by foreign powers.

""The whole situation has become very awkward. Qatar and its big rivals are fighting each other, but indirectly and on other people's territory,"" said Yemeni analyst Farea al-Muslimi.

""Having internal Arab messes like this escalate and get more complicated makes it pretty clear that the Arab world is far away from solving other issues like Palestine or Iraq or even the relationship with Iran.""

In Libya, the UAE and Qatar, which both played key roles in backing rebels in the uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, have emerged as rivals on the battlefield with conflicting interests and visions.

The UAE, along with Egypt, has backed anti-Islamist former army commander Khalifa Haftar, appointed by a government and parliament based in the east. Qatar and Turkey have supported rival Islamist-leaning factions in western Libya.

In Yemen -- mired in conflict since Saudi Arabia launched an air war in 2015 against the Houthi movement that controls the capital -- a southern Yemeni secessionist council armed by the UAE opposes the internationally recognized government because it includes the Qatar-backed Muslim Brotherhood.

The council and Yemen's Saudi-backed government, despite years of Qatar ties, cut diplomatic relations with Doha.

The eastern-based Libyan government and parliament aligned with anti-Islamist Haftar did the same.

""We are certain that the concerned states in the Gulf and Egypt will put pressure so as to drastically shift Qatar's outrageous policies,"" Mohamed Dayri, the foreign minister of the eastern government, told Reuters.

On Friday Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain designated as terrorists five Libyans including Tripoli Grand Mufti Sadiq al-Ghariani, an influential figure for anti-Haftar militias in western Libya. They also listed the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB), a group that has tried to revive armed opposition to Haftar since last year.

Qatar has for years punched well above its weight in world affairs by parleying its vast gas wealth into influence across the region, irking the UAE and dominant Gulf Arab power Saudi Arabia with its maverick stances and support for Islamists.

Now, Qatar's powerful neighbors appear to be demanding a retreat from those conflicts.

""The message now is that it's time for Qatar to withdraw from the region and essentially not have an independent foreign policy,"" said Peter Salisbury, an analyst at Chatham House.

""It looks like Saudi Arabia and the UAE won't be satisfied until Qatar is pushed to stop funding the groups they don't like, the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.""

But these demands come while Qatar's allies have for the most part been forced onto the back foot.

Blessed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, former Egyptian army chief and now president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted the Qatar-aligned elected Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in a 2013 military takeover.

Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, some of its leaders based in Doha, is no closer to leading the Palestinian people then when it fell out with secular rivals in the Fatah party in 2007.

The Gulf spat is likely to further fuel inter-rebel conflicts in Syria, where rivalries between Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been showcased since the earliest days of the crisis.

Qatar's friends who retain a plausible chance at national leadership, in Libya and Yemen, may have the most to lose from the row.

Haftar styles himself as a bane of extremism, and has become the dominant figure in eastern Libya since launching a campaign against Islamist groups and former rebels in Benghazi three years ago. Many suspect he seeks national rule.

His supporters believe the Qatar spat vindicates their anti-Islamist stance, as Haftar has gained ground and the U.N.-backed Tripoli government that he has rejected has been floundering.

Any hardening of the Haftar camp's stance could complicate mediation efforts by Libya's neighbors to the west, Algeria and Tunisia, which have been pushing for an inclusive, negotiated solution.

Russia denied the report.

11402035,2017-03-10,"It is the clearest signal to date that Moscow is prepared to back up its public diplomatic support for Haftar -- even at the risk of alarming Western governments already irked at Russia's intervention in Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad.

Haftar is opposed to a U.N.-backed government which Western states see as the best chance of restoring stability in Libya. But some Russian policy-makers see the Libyan as a strongman who can end the six years of anarchy that followed the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi.

The presence of the military contractors was, according to the head of the firm, a commercial arrangement. It is unlikely though to have been possible without Moscow's approval, according to people who work in the industry in Russia.

Oleg Krinitsyn, owner of private Russian firm RSB-group, said he sent the contractors to eastern Libya last year and they were pulled out in February having completed their mission.

In an interview with Reuters, he said their task was to remove mines from an industrial facility near the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, in an area that Haftar's forces had liberated from Islamist rebels.

He declined to say who hired his firm to provide the contractors, where they were operating or what the industrial facility was. He did not say if the operation had been approved by the U.N.-backed government, which most states view as the sovereign ruler of Libya.

Asked whether the mission had official blessing from Moscow, Krinitsyn said his firm did not work with the Russian defense ministry, but was ""consulting"" with the Russian foreign ministry.

The contractors did not take part in combat, Krinitsyn said, but they were armed with weapons they obtained in Libya. He declined to specify what type of weapons. A U.N. arms embargo prohibits the import of weapons to Libya unless it is under the control of the U.N.-backed government.

Krinitsyn said his contractors were ready to strike back in case of an attack.

""If we're under assault we enter the battle, of course, to protect our lives and the lives of our clients,"" Krinitsyn said. ""According to military science, a counterattack must follow an attack. That means we would have to destroy the enemy.""

Military and government officials in eastern Libya said they were not aware of the presence of the contractors, while Haftar did not respond to a request for comment.

Officials in Western Libya, where the U.N.-backed government is based, were not immediately available to comment. The Russian foreign ministry said it was working on a response to Reuters questions bit had not commented by Friday.

Underscoring Libya's volatility, Haftar's forces have this week been fighting to regain control over the Mediterranean oil terminals of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, which a rival faction seized earlier this month.

Russia has a record of using private military contractors as an extension of its own military.

In Syria, military contractors have been widely used in combat roles in conjunction with Russian regular forces and their Syrian allies, according to multiple accounts given to Reuters by people involved in the operations. Moscow has not acknowledged using private contractors in Syria.

Russian security companies do not reveal the background of people they hire but the contractors usually are special forces veterans.

Krinitsyn, the owner of the company which hired the contractors for Libya, was an officer of the Russian border guard service based in Tajikistan, on the border with Afghanistan, where he said he gained battlefield experience.

Krinitsyn said some of the contractors he hired for Libya has previously worked in Syria, though not in combat roles.

He declined to say how many contractors were involved in the mission in Libya, citing commercial secrecy. However, he said that in general, a de-mining operation of this type would require around 50 mine clearance experts and around the same number for their security detail.

Haftar has been seeking outside help to consolidate his control over parts of Libya. Russia has shown a willingness to engage with him that contrasts with the more cautious approach of Western governments.

Haftar visited Moscow in November last year and met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. In December, Haftar went on board a Russian aircraft carrier off the Libyan coast and spoke with the Russian defense minister via videolink. In recent weeks, Russia has taken in 100 of Haftar's wounded fighters for medical treatment.

Moscow also received Haftar's rival, Fayez Serraj, the head of the UN-backed government, for talks this month.

President Vladimir Putin, newly confident from the Russian military intervention in Syria, is anxious to restore stability in Libya. But foreign diplomats familiar with Russian thinking say there is so far no consensus on how to achieve that.

They say the foreign ministry wants Haftar to join forces with the U.N.-backed government. But the diplomats say there is a more hawkish camp, centered on the Russian defense ministry and some people in the Kremlin, which favors backing Haftar to establish control over the whole of Libya.

Krinitsyn, the contractors' boss, said that while in Libya his employees had run into a group of local militants. He said the militants were initially hostile, but became friendly when they realized the outsiders were Russians.

""It was an uncomfortable situation but the image created by Putin in Syria played a positive role. We realized that Russia is welcomed in Libya more than other countries are,"" he said.

11402200,2017-07-13,"OPEC exports have come under pressure this week from technical threats to oil fields, with Saudi Arabia's Manifa problems grabbing the headlines.

Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, while addressing the World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul, stated that the outlook for oil supplies is ""increasingly worrying"", due to a loss of $1 trillion ($1000 billion) in investments last year. The skepticism shown by a majority of financial analysts and oil commentators about the real threat to global oil (and gas) production volumes was countered by the news that the production at Saudi Aramco's main offshore oil field, Manifa, has been hit by technical problems. News sources reported that the output from Saudi Aramco's massive Manifa oilfield has been hit by a technical problem. The impact of this possible technical mishap is not to be underestimated. Aramco's Manifa is one of its biggest oilfields, with a targeted production capacity of around 900,000 bpd, to be brought onstream in two phases. At present, the main issue being reported on is that there has been corrosion of the water injection system, which is used to keep pressure in the reservoir. No facts have emerged about the total impact on the Manifa production capacity, but unnamed sources are already quoting 'millions of dollars' of losses. The current reports are not really worrying, as corrosion control in a water injection system is only a technical challenge. Maintenance of the field is expected, resulting in a shut-down of production - something that has been confirmed by Sadad Al Husseini, former VP Aramco. If the all production needs to be shut-down, Saudi Aramco's overall production capacity will be cut by 900,000bpd.

The current corrosion problem at Manifa is not new when looking at the overall situation of some giant fields in the Kingdom. Aramco has been fighting an uphill battle for years to counter existing corrosion threats to the Ghawar, Manifa and other fields. The problem is immense, as main production wells could be completely blocked if no solutions are found for corrosion and scaling issues. Until now, no real solutions have been found, except the traditional mitigation in place.

At the same time, Saudi Arabia's export volumes have been hit by high local summer demand for crude oil and products. The Kingdom already stated that it will cut overall crude oil shipments by around 600,000 bpd in August to balance the rise in domestic consumption during the summer. Increased local demand is not only a growing problem for Saudi Arabia, but for most Persian Gulf producers. Saudi August crude exports could fall to around 6.6 million bpd. A majority of cuts will be made to export volumes to the U.S. and Asia. Saudi sources expect that Saudi crude volumes to the U.S. will be below 800,000 bpd, while exports to Asia will be around 3.5 million bpd (decrease of 200,000 bpd). Europe's imports will be only down by 70,000 bpd, reaching a level of 520,000 bpd.

When looking at the Saudi situation, the need for new investments and increased technology development is clear. Saudi Aramco's investment of $300 billion in the next 10 years will, in large part, be focusing on the new technology needed to keep existing projects running while opening up new volumes in the future. Its drive to increase overall gas production will also be based on a two-fold approach. One is to counter growing domestic demand for natural gas as a power generator. At the same time, with most focus on crude oil production, gas will need to be reinjected into the field to keep production at necessary levels. Both targets will only be possible to reach if the growing technical challenges in gas production in the Kingdom, due to sour gas issues, can be countered effectively.

The Saudi situation is not different from its neighbors. The Kingdom has the same challenges as its current main political adversary, Qatar. The latter's national oil company, Qatar Petroleum, has only been able to maintain crude oil production on its main offshore oilfield Al Shaheen through heavy investments from its former joint-venture partner Maersk Oil. After the Danish concession, the operations are set to be led by French oil major Total. The Al Shaheen oil field is located in Qatari waters, 80 kilometers north of Ras Laffan, with facilities consisting of 33 platforms and close to 400 wells. Currently producing about 300,000 barrels of oil per day, Al Shaheen is Qatar's largest offshore oil field and one of the largest offshore oil fields in the world. The production has been one of the main revenue generators for the Qatari government. To keep production up, QP and Total have already announced the need for a $3.5 billion investment plan for the exploration of the Al Shaheen field. This was reported during the launch of the North Oil Company (NOC), which was established a year ago as a partnership between a wholly owned affiliate of QP (70 percent) and a wholly owned affiliate of Total (30 percent).

The challenges for this field are still immense. Already in 2013 QP asked all foreign operators to come up with redevelopment plans to increase recovery rates and, if possible, production at its mature fields. Between 2012 and 2016, Maersk had been working on field development, slated to have cost $1.5 billion, to sustain output at current levels. Sources indicated at that time that excessive associated gas at Al-Shaheen could prevent it from increasing crude output. Other geological challenges at the field include thin and stretched reservoirs. More knowledge of these thin reservoirs and extended wells is still needed. The fact that the French oil major Total has now taken over is not a surprise, with its technical capabilities and financial strength needed to counter the current problems. Qatar's remaining fields are experiencing similar threats.

Amin Nasser's aim is to go beyond global oil markets. His assessments are based on regional (OPEC) developments, as production of oil and gas in the so-called cheap oil regions is also under threat. These technical challenges will need an increased amount of investments, which will be hard to come by in today's market. If Saudi Aramco or QP are already experiencing production threats, the situation in other production regions, such as Nigeria, Libya or Mexico, could be even more dire. With increased demand for crude oil and petroleum products still shown in all international assessments, the market will need to react. A production shutdown due to technical issues is not as easy to counter as a weather or geopolitical issue. More money is needed, otherwise production fields will be closed down and international clients, including utilities or chemical companies, will bear the brunt of it. A shutdown of one or two giant fields will take the market from an oil glut to an oil shortage within weeks.

Assessments that a shutdown in the Middle East or a major OPEC producer can be covered by new production elsewhere is not entirely unrealistic. But the current production increases in Nigeria, Iraq and Libya, will most probably be temporary. Growing political instability in Libya, as the LNA is targeting control of the country, or the re-emergence of the Niger Delta insurgency, will put a cap on increases.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Istanbul', 'United States', 'Qatar', 'Denmark', 'Iraq', 'Nigeria', 'Mexico', 'Libya']",The Technical Failure That Could Clear The Oil Glut In A Matter Of Weeks | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Technical-Failure-That-Could-Clear-The-Oil-Glut-In-A-Matter-Of-Weeks.html,None,
11402201,2017-05-02,"A rift has opened between Libya's U.N.-backed government and its powerful National Oil Corporation (NOC), threatening the fractured country's political cohesion and its nascent petroleum-industry recovery.

On Monday, NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla announced that the country has built its oil production up to 760,000 barrels per day and planned to go ahead with plans to expand production to 1.1 million bpd by August of this year.

Just a few days earlier, that same official openly criticized Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA), a United Nations-backed government whose formation last year raised hopes of political unity in a nation divided by warring militant groups. Sanalla said the GNA aimed to wrest control of NOC's petroleum deals for power over Libya's economic future.

Oil profits will be the lifeblood of any successful future government in Libya. Under Gaddafi's reign, fossil fuels made up over 90 percent of Tripoli's revenues, which the government used to provide heavy food and consumer goods subsidies to its citizens in exchange for loyalty.

After years of internal struggle, the NOC has managed to develop a firm grip over 90 percent of Libya's oil export revenues. The company achieves this by claiming to maintain its independence from various factions vying to run the country until elections are held, but Sanalla's recent statement condemning the GNA breaks from this policy.

The NOC owes its recent stability to the Libyan National Army, which operates under strict orders from Khalifa Haftar. The Gaddafi-era general -- a U.S. citizen who lived in the United States for 20 years -- has managed to defend the nation's oilfields and prevent rival groups from interfering with production operations.

Haftar's maneuvering has ushered in a period of stability in Libya, which has earned him a say in political matters. Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken note of the burgeoning figure, offering him weapons, tours of Russian vessels, and direct access to senior Russian officials..

Sanalla's attack on the GNA's credibility and alleged sabotage of the NOC's work signals a shift in favor away from the pro-Western United Nations and towards Russian interests. Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj have long been at odds as well.

The latest conflict occurred in February in Cairo, a city considered to be Haftar's home turf due to Egypt's backing of LNA military ventures via air strikes. The general's departure from the Egyptian Capital without meeting with al-Sarraj caused him to lose aerial support from Libya's eastern neighbor as well as from the United Arab Emirates.

The NOC remains the most powerful domestic factor in the Libyan political arena due to its power over the oil resources necessary for the reconstruction of major cities affected by six years of civil war. Haftar and his LNA is the greatest military strength in the country. Both parties' distance from the GNA suggests the international community's plan for the future of Libya inches closer to complete failure each day.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Russia', 'Cairo', 'Egypt', 'United Arab Emirates']",Oil Politics Driving Libya Closer To Failure | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Oil-Politics-Driving-Libya-Closer-To-Failure.html,None,
11402202,2017-01-26,"Despite some suggestions that oil prices will level off at around $60 in 2017, since the initial surge of the OPEC production deal prices have barely nudged above $53. Over the long-term, outlooks are more bearish than bullish, and a major reason for that is the strong likelihood of increased production in three places: Libya, Nigeria and Iran.

All three countries were effectively exempt from the OPEC production cuts, for various reasons. Iran has agreed to keep its production level below 4 million bpd, allowing it to add about 90,000 bpd to its production level. Nigeria has suffered significant cuts to production over the last year, chiefly due to the activities of militants in the Niger River Delta.

Libya has been torn apart by civil war and a fight between its recognized government and separatists in its eastern regions, with the country's rich oil fields and refineries the major prize in frequent skirmishes.

Cuts from OPEC members totaling 1.5 million bpd, together with non-OPEC cuts of nearly 600,000 bpd, have already pushed prices above the their threshold in 2016 of $50, but there's strong evidence that the initial market impact of the OPEC deal is on the verge of playing itself out. Over the next year, activity in these three countries could continue to exert downward pressure on prices.

That is, of course, if Libya is able to stay the course and succeed in bringing its oil industry back to full strength. While the immediate outlook for a strong recovery in Libyan production is good, the political situation in the country is uneasy and instability, in the form of renewed fighting between rival factions, could return to disrupt oil production.

Libya succeeded in bringing the bulk of its oil production and export capacity back on line in Fall 2016. Between September 2016 and January 2017, Libyan production climbed from 300,000 bpd to nearly 700,000 bpd, a three-year high according to the National Oil Company (NOC). The increase came after military forces succeeded in retaking key installations in the east of the country, where separatist sentiment is strongest.

The government has announced plans to increase production to at least 1 million bpd by the end of the year. These plans were delayed this week by an electrical failure at the Sarir oilfield, which cut 60,000 bpd in production. This will likely be a short-term outage, and only days before, a spokesman from Libya's internally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) boasted that the country's oil production had already exceeded 750,000 bpd.

Already, the country's production has increased twenty-three percent since November, according to Bloomberg. A spokesman for Libya predicted on Tuesday that the country would its goal and pump 1.25 million bpd by the end of the year.

In 2011, before the revolt toppled the government of Muammar Qaddafi, Libya produced 1.6 million bpd. To recover to that level, the country will need between $100 and $120 billion in outside investment to rebuild its damaged infrastructure and explore new fields. There has been a moratorium in place since 2011, but the GNA announced on Tuesday that Libya's oil fields are now open to foreign investment.

How quickly production can reach the anticipated level of 1 million bpd depends on conditions inside the country, where violence could escalate and the weak grasp of the GNA over the oil fields and export facilities could be broken. American air strikes have helped Libyan authorities decimate local forces loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS), but the immediate future for Libya's political stability are uncertain, with trends pointing towards a bid for power by General Khalifa Haftar, who had attempted to seize power in 2014 only to fail and endure a brief exile in the United States. He is now positioned to make another move towards putting himself in power, with strong backing from Russia's president Vladimir Putin.

Haftar, as leader of the Libyan National Army (LNA), an organization with only loose ties to the GNA, has shunned the government in Tripoli and built a powerbase in the east of the country. The general was recently welcomed aboard a Russian aircraft carrier returning from Syria, and analysts now point to Libya as another arena in which Moscow is exerting its influence in the Middle East. Haftar, though previously backed by the United States, is now recognized as a Russia-backed actor with aspirations to seize control over Libya from the GNA.

Attempts by countries like Italy, which has a historic connection to Libya as its former colonial master and maintains strong strategic and economic interests there, to stabilize the GNA have had only a limited effect, as the government appears too weak to exert much influence over the other rival factions, including Haftar and the LNA.

Should Haftar, or forces loyal to him, attempt a move against the unsteady government in Tripoli, it could trigger greater instability in Libya, upsetting oil production. With production now just recovering, and an unsteady peace between Tripoli and Haftar, the immediate chances of a coup in Libya seem remote. But a change in the political situation could once again disrupt Libya's recovering oil industry, with a corresponding upward effect on oil prices.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Nigeria', 'Libya', 'Iran', 'Moscow', 'Tripoli', 'Syria', 'Russia', 'Italy']",Is Libya A Bigger Threat To Oil Prices Than U.S. Shale? | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Libya-A-Bigger-Threat-To-Oil-Prices-Than-US-Shale.html,None,

Oil prices are set to close out the year somewhere around 15 percent up, and the oil market looks more stable than it has in years. But what does 2018 have in store?

Most analysts believe more of the same - inventory declines, some shale growth, a gradual increase in the oil price and eventually an end to the OPEC deal. But a lot of uncertainty remains.

There is no doubt that U.S. shale output is continuing to rise, but there is quite a bit of uncertainty about the magnitude of growth. Expectations have fluctuated over the course of 2017. At the beginning of the year, outlets like the EIA and IEA had very bullish predictions for shale output, with the EIA expecting U.S. output to average 10 million barrels per day in 2018.

As the year wore on, numerous red flags began to pop up that raised a lot of questions about the health of the shale industry. Drilling costs began to rise again; some shale companies ran into operational problems; drilling activity fizzled when oil prices dipped below $50 per barrel, a sign that the shale industry's breakeven prices (on average) were not as low as many thought; the rig count dipped; and investors began demanding more restraint and a slower pace of drilling. These problems seemed to suggest shale was sputtering.

However, more recently, data suggests shale is back on track, posting strong production gains in September. In their December reports, the IEA and OPEC predicted U.S. shale would add 870,000 bpd and 1 mb/d of new supply in 2018, respectively. That threatens to overwhelm demand growth. But the extent to which actual growth lives up to those forecasts will go a long way in determining the pace of rebalancing next year.

#2 OPEC Compliance

OPEC production fell in November for the fourth consecutive month, dipping by 130,000 bpd compared to a month earlier. That puts the group's compliance rate with the production cuts at 115 percent, the highest number yet. The ability of OPEC to stick with its commitments is a positive sign heading into 2018 that they will be able to keep compliance rates high. To be sure, involuntary declines in Venezuela are somewhat masking less-than-100-percent compliance from Iraq and the UAE, but a reduction of supply is a reduction of supply.

The big question is the durability of high compliance throughout 2018. An oil market that rebalances too quickly could lead OPEC members to abandon their pledges if they become tempted by higher oil prices. Russia has signaled that it is anxious to abandon the deal as soon as inventories fall back to average levels. The flipside is also true - a steep drop in prices could lure members into cheating as they become desperate for more revenues. But that is all speculation. For now, compliance looks good.

#3 OPEC's Exit Strategy

OPEC has restored some stability to the oil market with its resolve to maintain output limits, and the strong cooperation, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Russia, reassured the oil market at the last OPEC meeting.

Yet, they left the details of an exit strategy for a later date, and the June 2018 meeting will carry extra weight, especially as the inventory surplus narrows. Exiting the production cuts is fraught with danger; even hinting that a return to full production could spook jittery oil traders, which is exactly why top OPEC officials were eager to push off that conversation. But by mid-2018, they won't be able to avoid the issue. It's likely OPEC will opt for some sort of glide path, a gradual lifting of the production limits, but we'll have to wait and see.

#4 Inventories

OPEC's strategy will largely come down to what happens to global inventories. OECD commercial stocks declined by more than 40 million barrels in October, putting total stocks at 2,940 million barrels, the lowest level in more than two years. The stock surplus is now at about 100 million barrels more than the five-year average, down two-thirds from the start of 2017. It's likely that the surplus will be erased at some point in 2018, at which point OPEC will be under pressure to abandon its production limits.

However, the IEA said in its December Oil Market Report that it expects inventories to begin rising again in 2018, largely because of blistering growth from U.S. shale (see #1 above). The first half of the year, the IEA predicts, will see inventories rise at a pace of 200,000 bpd. If the agency is correct, zeroing out the surplus could prove elusive.

#5 Unexpected outages

All of these forecasts and predictions go out the window if supply disruptions occur. Just days ago, the Forties pipeline cracked and shut down, and the pipeline's operator declared force majeure on oil shipments. The 450,000-bpd pipeline could be shut for weeks, leading to shutdowns at North Sea oil fields. This incident is exactly the type of event that can catch the oil market by surprise, leading to sharp and sudden price increases even if all seems well elsewhere in the world.

There are plenty of potential flashpoints that could lead to supply outages in 2018. The most obvious is Venezuela, which is suffering from steep and ongoing declines. Venezuela's output fell by 41,000 bpd in November from a month earlier, after suffering a decline of 26,000 bpd in October. Production is at a 30-year low and is heading south. Other outages are entirely possible in unstable countries like Nigeria and Libya. Conflict between the U.S. and Iran would be a whole different animal, with serious implications for the oil market. Then, there are other potential outages that are entirely unpredictable beforehand. The crack in the Forties pipeline, the spill from the Keystone pipeline in the U.S. from a few weeks ago and the massive wildfires in Alberta in 2016 are just a few examples. It only takes one major disruption to upend the most carefully crafted oil forecast.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['United States', 'Pittsburgh', 'Iraq', 'Venezuela', 'Russia', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Alberta', 'Nigeria', 'Libya', 'Iran']",The 5 Oil Factors To Watch In 2018 | OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/The-5-Oil-Factors-To-Watch-In-2018.html,None,

Algeria was up slightly in November after that huge decline in October.

Angola was the biggest loser in November, down 108,700 barrels per day.

Ecuador, though holding its own for the last year, appears to be in slow decline.

I have managed to cobble together an estimate of Equatorial Guinea's historical C+C production. I had the EIA's production numbers through June 2013. I subtracted 10 percent for ""other liquids"", then merged that with the OPEC MOMR data that started in 2016. However, Equatorial Guinea's production is not enough to make much difference.

Gabon is also in slow decline. And their production is not enough to make much difference in total OPEC production.

Iran ignores any OPEC request to cut production and continues to produce flat out.

Iraq peaked last December and down only slightly since then.

Kuwait peaked last November then dropped sharply in January and has held steady since then.

Libya's political problems have ebbed, but their oil production doesn't seem to be responding very much.

Libya was the largest gainer in November, up 95,800 barrels per day. It looks like Nigeria peaked in 2005 and have been declining since.

Qatar peaked in 2008. Their big exports are natural gas and natural gas products.

Saudi Arabia is holding steady, down about 600,000 bpd since peaking last year.

Venezuela's decline continues. They were down 41,600 bpd in November. Venezuela is on the verge of becoming a failed state. What happens to their oil production in the future is anyone's guess. But it doesn't look good.

The OPEC MOMR says world oil production was up 840,000 barrels per day in November while OPEC crude production was down 133,500 bpd. That would mean Non-OPEC total liquids + OPEC NGLs would be up 973,500 bpd. I don't really think so. Russian C+C was up only 7,700 bpd so that means Non-OPEC and OPEC NGLs were up 965,800 bpd. I think that figure will have to be revised downward.

Russia C+C oil production according to the Russian Oil Minister. I am using 7.3 barrels per ton here. The Oil Minister's production numbers average about 400,000 barrels per day above the EIA's Russia production numbers. I have no idea why we have this discrepancy. Both are supposed to be crude + condensate.

OPEC + Russia is 57 percent of world oil production. The last four months of 2016 are all above the black line in the chart above. This was all ""positioning"" for future cuts. This could have been done by draining storage tanks and delaying well maintenance. The sudden decline, January through May, was refilling storage tanks and catching up on well maintenance. The six months since then, June through November, is everyone producing every barrel they possibly can, or near that anyway.

Here is the other 43 percent of world oil production, Non-OPEC less Russia. This data is only through August 2017, the latest EIA data. Non-OPEC less Russia peaked in December of 2014 and is down 2 million barrels per day since then. The 12 months trailing average peaked 10 months later and is down 1 million barrels per day since, or in August 2017.

Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) was ""working towards a swift restart of production. At this moment, there are no plans to declare force majeure,"" Reuters quoted the NOC as saying in a statement today.

According to a trading source, the latest shutdown at Sharara was due to a protest over salaries. Just before the oil field was closed on Sunday, it was producing around 236,000 bpd, the engineer at the field told Reuters.

Yesterday's shutdown is the latest in a string of issues with blockades and closings at the Sharara field this year.

At the beginning of last month, Sharara had resumed production following a two-week halt. The pipeline that was blocked feeds crude oil from Sharara to the Zawiya export terminal.

""More than 360,000 barrels per day of Libyan crude oil production has been shut in by a criminal militia operating in Western Libya,"" NOC said in a statement on August 30.

""The militia, which calls itself the Rayayina Patrols Brigade, illegally shut the trunk crude oil pipeline (Line 30) from the Sharara oil field to Zawiya at the Rayayina valve on 19th August 2017, cutting production by an estimated 283,000 bpd. The militia also illegally closed Line 18 from Hamada to Zawiya on 25th August, shutting 8,000 bpd, and broke into the control room at the El-Feel field on 26th August 2017, shutting down 70,000 bpd of production there,"" NOC said at the end of August.

Before the August shutdown at Sharara, Libya was producing around 1.1 million bpd -- after topping 1 million bpd at end-June for the first time in four years. This was still short of pre-2011 levels, when Libya produced about 1.6 million bpd, but on the way to 1.2 million bpd - the daily production figure NOC announced it will be striving for earlier this year.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Zawiya, Libya']","Libya's Sharara Oil Field Closed Again, 230,000 Bpd Output Offline | OilPrice.com",http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyas-Sharara-Oil-Field-Closed-Again-230000-Bpd-Output-Offline.html,None,

Conflict-torn Libya, divided between rival factions in the east and the west, recently reached 1 million bpd of crude oil output -- for the first time since 2013.

The oil production recovery has put in the spotlight the chairman of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC), Mustafa Sanalla, whom analysts see as a central figure in the oil sector, wearing the hats of both a diplomat and an oil minister. It will be Sanalla who will lead Libya's delegation at the upcoming meeting of the Joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) in Russia, at which he will argue his country's position and share production plans for the immediate future.

And the monitoring committee will be eager to find out how much Libya's plans could further offset the cartel and friends' production cuts, from which the African nation is -- for now at least -- exempt.

Winning exemption at the time of the November OPEC deal wasn't difficult for Libya, whose production was at the mercy of the civil strife and port blockades that plagued Libya over the past few years.

Libya's production averaged 390,000 bpd throughout 2016 and 404,000 bpd in 2015, according to OPEC's secondary sources. In the fourth quarter last year, output increased slightly to an average of 574,000 bpd.

Since then, the lifting of port seizures and blockades and the June interim deal with Germany's Wintershall to immediately resume production in concession areas and related fields, which unblocked 160,000 bpd worth of output -- has helped Libya to nearly double production.

The recovery of Libya and Nigeria's crude oil production in the past two months has rekindled fears that rising supply from those two exempt African producers is offsetting a large part of the reductions and is depressing crude oil prices, alongside rising U.S. shale output.

Libya's oil production recovery is the primary goal of NOC's chairman Sanalla, who said in an opinion piece in the New York Times in June, referring to the country's internal power struggles:

""Between 2013 and last September, these blockaded nearly all of Libya's main oil ports and tried to leverage that chokehold into ransom money and political power. That cost the country over $120 billion in lost revenues and most of its financial reserves.""

Arguing that the country's oil and gas resources should not be held hostage to power struggles and fractious politics, Sanalla noted:

""Caught between those rivals, we at the N.O.C. intend to remain neutral until there is a single legitimate government we can submit to.""

Geoff Porter, founder of the North Africa Risk Consulting, said in an interview with Bloomberg, commenting on Sanalla's role in the Libyan oil sector:

""His job is to produce as much oil as possible while he can and I think that's what he is going to continue to try to do.""

However, years of neglect and attacks on facilities have damaged the output capacity, and infrastructure needs investments if Libya were to return to producing 1.6 million bpd, its output level before the 2011 revolution that toppled Muammar Ghaddafi.

Libya may be close to its capacity, and possibly has a short-term ""implicit"" ceiling of just above 1 million bpd, Mattia Toaldo, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Bloomberg.

So Libya could 'cap' not because OPEC asks it to, but because of infrastructure limitations.

Unlike fellow exempt producer Nigeria -- which has signaled that it could cap production when its production reaches a stable 1.8 million bpd -- Libya has not specified any output level for a possible ceiling.

Last week, Sanalla told Reuters in comments sent via email:

""Libya's political, humanitarian and economic situation needs to be taken into account if we are going to talk about production caps.""

""Accurate information will remove uncertainty and help the market understand and respond to future supply levels,"" NOC's chairman noted.

The OPEC/non-OPEC monitoring committee will receive the latest updates regarding Libya's production and plans -- and get more information about expected supply from the cartel -- at the OPEC meeting this weekend. Despite the fact that the monitoring committee is only making recommendations to the larger group, it may consider whether further actions are needed in view of the latest supply figures and forecasts for the coming months.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'United States', 'Russia', 'Nigeria', 'Germany']",Libya's Oil King Won't Be Stopped By OPEC | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libyas-Oil-King-Wont-Be-Stopped-By-OPEC.html,None,

""Clashes lasted for three hours, but the two tankers were successfully seized,"" Qassem said.

The official did not specify whether the gun battle caused any causalities, and did not identify the nationalities of the crew members.

The lack of a unified governing body in Libya had made the North African nation a haven for smugglers and traffickers who bring boatloads of people to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. Fighting between the two rival governments and related militant groups has affected the recovery of Libya's oil sector since the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Libya's NOC has said that it would target production of around 1.2 million bpd by the end of this year, but this level is currently nowhere in sight. As per OPEC's secondary sources, Libya - exempt from the production cuts due to the violence - produced 622,000 bpd in March, down from 683,000 bpd in February.

Should the field, also known as Elephant, start producing soon, it could add up to 90,000 bpd to Libya's oil output that has been crippled by continuous faction fighting and political turmoil.

Authorities are working to fix soon the power outage at the field, which has been closed since April 2015, Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) Brigadier Idris Bukhamada told Bloomberg.

In December last year, NOC confirmed in a statement the re-opening of Shahara and El-Feel fields, with production capacity of about 330,000 bpd and 90,000 bpd, respectively, after Rayayina Patrols Company of the PFG, Western Branch, announced lifting of the blockade on all the pipelines.

However, guards wanting benefits prevented El-Feel from reopening.

Last week, NOC said that the Fazan Branch of PFG has been blockading production at El-Feel since 20 December 2016 and that Libya's direct losses from that exceeded $460 million.

Another field in the west that Eni operates together with NOC, Wafa, has also been producing in fits and starts amid the civil unrest and militia fighting.

The Libya National Army (LNA) claimed on Tuesday to have retaken the country's key oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider from a rival faction that seized them earlier this month.

The LNA, led by General Khalifa Haftar, and aligned with Libya's House of Representatives, has been fighting the Benghazi Defense Brigades (BDB) faction in the Oil Crescent since the beginning of March, forcing it to retake the oil ports from a rival faction for the second time in less than a year.

According to the LNA, as of Tuesday afternoon EST, its forces were still in pursuit of BDB fighters, who were on the run after they lost control of the ports.

It was only in September last year, when the LNA wrested control of the ports from rival factions, that Libya's oil started flowing again, prompting calls for a ramp up in production and exports after a long, budget-draining hiatus.

In September, the LNA also retook control of two other key oil export terminals in the Oil Crescent -- Zueitina and Brega.

The fighting between the LNA and BDB has so far been limited to Ras Lanuf and Es Sider.

The BDB claims to have no alliances, but is widely thought to be a radical Islamist faction. The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium lists the BDB as an Islamist group formed in opposition to the LNA and consolidating fighters from other factions opposed to General Haftar.

After retaking the ports in September, the LNA handed control over them to the National Oil Company (NOC), and crude exports were resumed after a two-year blockade, during which time the terminals were controlled by the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) -- an armed group affiliated at the time with the UN-backed Libyan government, and used its control to extract money from various authorities.

Libya has lost 35,000 barrels per day since the latest clashes broke out in the beginning of March, putting production down to about 660,000 bpd. Before the latest clashes, Libya was producing around 700,000 barrels of oil daily, with plans to raise this to 1.1 million barrels by the end of the year.

Last week, due to ongoing clashes, the Overseas Redwood oil tanker, scheduled to load 630,000 barrels of crude at Es Sider, was forced to dock instead at Zawiya port.

The latest clashes had also forced Waha Oil Co - a joint venture between Libya's NOC and U.S. firms Hess Corp, Marathon Oil, and ConocoPhillips - to suspend production over port closures.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', ""Ra's Lanuf"", 'Brega', 'Zawiya, Libya', 'United States']",Libya's LNA Retakes Key Oil Ports -- Again | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Libyas-LNA-Retakes-Key-Oil-PortsAgain.html,None,
11402524,2017-02-07,"Commodities giant Glencore has extended its deal with Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) to be the exclusive trader of around 230,000 bpd of Libya's current crude oil production of around 700,000 bpd, Reuters reported on Monday, citing sources familiar with the deal.

According to the extended deal - whose period was not immediately known - Glencore is entitled to be the sole trader of some 230,000 bpd from the oil fields Sarir and Mesla, Reuters sources say.

The agreement gives Glencore advantage over commodity trading rivals Vitol and Trafigura in Libya's crude oil trading market for a second year in a row.

""It is a big mosaic at the moment, but Glencore has kept a large chunk of the trade,"" one source told Reuters.

In October last year Glencore's global head of oil Alex Beard said that the mining and commodity trading giant would be seeking to take on more crude oil trading in Iraq, Iran, Libya and Russia in a bid to boost its trading division.

At the time Beard said, speaking at the Reuters Commodities Summit:

""We're very happy with our relationship with NOC and we've been very pleased to support them through some difficult times in the last 12 months and we're open to do more business there.""

Back in 2015, Glencore secured a deal with Libya's NOC to buy half of the country's then oil output of around 400,000 bpd. That deal was for the only relatively stable onshore production in Libya at the time, with civil unrest and port blockades crippling the country's oil production in recent years.

Lately, Libya has recovered its crude oil production to around 700,000 bpd in January. The country seeks to increase oil production to 1.25 million bpd by the end of 2017 and 1.6 million bpd by 2022, the chairman of Libya's National Oil Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla, said last month.

11402777,2017-09-01,"Dr. Cyril Widdershoven is a long-time observer of the global energy market. Presently, he holds several advisory positions with international think tanks in the Middle...

In addition to the negative repercussions of hurricane Harvey, which heavily impacted the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production and petrochemical plants, global oil markets are facing disruptions from the Middle East. The market has not been focusing on geopolitical security issues lately, but over the coming months geopolitics is sure to become an increasingly important factor. Political instability and civil wars, particularly those involving OPEC member states, are far from reaching a conclusion. The market's optimism about the heavily reported production increases of Libya, Iraq and Nigeria may be misplaced. Libya's return to the market, with production reportedly breaking 1 million bpd while targeting 1.3 million bpd, could already be a thing of the past due to growing instability on the ground.

Libya's production increases, which have been questioned by insiders, have proven to be unsustainable due to fighting between militias and government forces in oil producing regions. After the shutdown of the Sharara oilfield last week, two other main producing fields have now been hit by armed militias in Libya's western region. Sources reported that an armed militia from Zintan, directly linked to the heavily armed Petroleum Facilities Guard, which was set up to protect the country's oil and gas infrastructure, has closed the El Feel and Hamada fields by blocking their respective pipelines. The Petroleum Facilities Guard is also slated to be involved in the Sharara oilfield shutdown. Officially, the militia claims it is fighting for better living conditions and the pay of salaries and services. However, it seems the current developments are not linked solely to social issues, but rather to the growing instability and tensions between the main military power factions in the country. The Zintan militia has already threatened to shut down the Wafa oilfield if their demands are not met.

A military conflict appears to be brewing between the Libyan National Army of General Haftar and the western militias. Egyptian sources have reported that a new military confrontation is expected soon between armed militias and the LNA in the so-called Oil Crescent Area. The Oil Crescent Area has been in the hands of Haftar's LNA since 2016 and is a bone of contention for Libya's main political parties. Severe clashes have already been reported in and around the Tripoli area, where militias are fighting each other in Suq al Khamis and Al Hira. Libyan sources claim that the militias are supported by the GNA, which is headed by Libyan leader Fayez Sarraj. Since the end of 2016 two attempts have been made by anti-Haftar groups to remove the LNA from the region. Major mobilization efforts are currently ongoing in and around the city of Sirte in preparation for a military assault on the LNA strongholds. Haftar's advisors expect that the militias will try to attack the Gulf of Sidra area in an attempt to gain control of the ports and oil installations up there. A possible onslaught is also expected to reach Benghazi and Derna. Derna is currently in the hands of anti-Haftar militias, perceived to be Al Qaeda supporters.

At present, the LNA is also confronted by internal splits and confrontations with affiliated militias. In recent days, a political rift has emerged between the Awaqir tribe in Benghazi and Haftar following the election of tribesman Faraj Egaim as Deputy Minister of Interior in the government of the Tripoli-based Presidential Council. Haftar, until now, has openly rejected the Presidential Council, which is led by Fayaz Serraj - who chose Egaim as Deputy Minister of Interior at the request of the tribe. Awaqir reportedly decided to join Sirraj's government in Tripoli because Abdullah Al-Thanni's government in east Libya is powerless. The Awaqir tribe also has Mihdi Al Barghati as minister of defense in the Council. The son of Haftar, Saddam, has already threatened to remove the council or arrest its members in response. The position of the LNA, and especially its Dignity Operation to remove opposition, Daesh and Al Qaeda in the eastern regions, is now under threat. Egaim was chief of the so-called ""Special Tasks Force"" in Benghazi, a tribal militia group that used to work under Dignity Operation.

The LNA is also continuing its siege of the city of Derna. Haftar stated on TV that he would reject any mediation that targets the lifting of the siege on Derna. For the last four weeks a military force has been trying to remove the opposition from Derna. The instability in this part of Libya has increased immensely. In addition to the ongoing internal power battles and military operations against armed militias, the LNA is also still having to fight pockets of Daesh/IS groups. While the optimism about the fight against IS has been high, the fundamentalist group is not dead and still fighting. The recent massacre and beheadings of several LNA fighters by Daesh is a prime example of this.

Libya's oil and gas future is at risk. Increased insecurity has already shutdown several of its oil fields and the Al Zawiya oil refinery. A total military clash in the region would bring the whole sector to a standstill. The removal of almost 300,000 bpd of crude oil will have its impact on the market. The current oil price scenarios appear to have not calculated this in however, as all media is focused on the effects of hurricane Harvey and the Gulf of Mexico. Once Hurricane Harvey passes, the market will have to refocus on the long-term (and continuing) effects of the loss of Libyan production. Taking out 300,000 bpd or more at this crucial point in time will have its effects. Prices will go up, as supply disruptions force markets into balance. Libya's future is still very bleak, while Nigeria's and Iraq's production increases are far from certainties.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Zintan', 'Derna, Libya', 'Iraq', 'Benghazi', 'Tripoli', 'Nigeria', 'Egypt', 'Sirte', 'Zawiya, Libya']",Are Libyan Oil Production Gains History? | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Are-Libyan-Oil-Production-Gains-History.html,None,

Oil prices have been under pressure again this week. With West Texas Intermediate yesterday falling 2 percent, to below $49 per barrel.

And some surprising numbers this week show that slide is likely to continue. With the world's largest oil-producing nations pumping out more crude than many energy observers are expecting.

That's OPEC. A group oil investors have been looking to as a saviour -- expecting that production cuts from key nations like Saudi Arabia will help support global oil prices.

But a survey released this week by Platts shows that OPEC output is far from declining. In fact, OPEC production in July hit its highest level for 2017 -- coming in at 32.82 million barrels per day, up 330,000 b/d from June.

There's one big reason for OPEC's surging production: Libya. A nation that saw its July production rise 180,000 barrel per day -- as key oil fields across the country restart under ceasefire deals between the central government and local rebel factions.

All told, Libya's July production rose to just under 1 million barrels per day. A big jump from the 700,000 barrels per day the country was producing as recently as March.

The concerning thing for OPEC is that Libya is exempted from the recent agreement on production cuts -- and thus free to ramp up output. Which has put OPEC as a whole well above its quota for total production, with July's output being 920,000 b/d above the agreed-upon ceiling of 31.9 million barrels.

Libyan officials have said they want to increase production further. With the government targeting 1.25 million barrels by the end of this year.

At the same time, production from the U.S. is also rising. With the U.S. Energy Information Administration this week increasing its forecast for 2017 domestic output.

All of which suggests that OPEC's much-lauded cuts are fading as a driver for higher crude prices. Watch for more numbers on Libya's production to see if output could go higher from here -- and for potential new action from the cartel to address the recent surge.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Libya', 'Saudi Arabia', 'United States']",Exposing The OPEC Deal Saboteurs | OilPrice.com,http://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Exposing-The-OPEC-Deal-Saboteurs.html,None,
11402781,2017-07-13,"Nigeria is ready to support OPEC's cuts and limit its crude oil output when it reaches a stable 1.8 million bpd, Nigerian Oil Minister Emmanuel Kachikwu said on Wednesday.

Nigeria and Libya -- exempt from OPEC's production cuts because of militancy that had crippled their production last year -- were the two producers that contributed the most to the 393,000-bpd increase in the cartel's total crude output in June compared to May. Libya's output jumped by 127,000 bpd to 852,000 bpd, while Nigerian crude production rose by 96,700 bpd to 1.733 million bpd.

Nigeria's average June production is very close to its target of 1.8-million-bpd, but its oil minister noted that he would have to see if output and the fragile peace are sustained.

""As a serious member of OPEC, we stand ready to support the cuts when we are sure that we can have a stable predictable production,"" Kachikwu said, as quoted by Bloomberg.

""We still are below the 1.8 million barrel a day benchmark set for us by OPEC. I think that over the next one or two months, hopefully, we can get to that point where we can say the recovery has been tested, it is systemic and predictable,"" the minister said.

Nigeria last produced 1.8 million bpd in February 2016, and according to data compiled by Bloomberg, its production capacity is 2.2 million bpd.

Nigeria's Ministry of Petroleum Resources said on Wednesday that minister Kachikwu confirmed he had been invited to attend the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC countries in Russia on July 24 that would discuss Nigeria and Libya's production, but he would not be able to attend because of a scheduling conflict.

Officially OPEC agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day beginning in January. So, they are getting close.

OPEC's November production of 33,374,000 represented an all-time high for the Cartel.

Algerian production held steady in February after a drop of 33,000 bpd in January.

Ecuador's production dropped 4,400 bpd in February after dropping 13,000 bpd in January.

Gabon dropped 7,000 bpd in February and reached a new low of 194,000 bpd.

Iran continues to ignore any requests from OPEC to cut production. Iran's production was up over 36,000 bpd in February to 3,814,000 bpd. The last time Iran produced this much oil was in October of 2008.

Iraqi production was down another 62,000 bpd in February to 4,414,000 bpd. They are still producing a lot more than Iraq.

Kuwaiti crude production declined by only 9,000 bpd in February after being down141,200 bpd in January.

Libya's production dropped by 11,000 bpd in February to 669,000 bpd.

Nigeria's production was up 58,000 bpd in February. Both Nigeria and Libya are exempt from OPEC cuts because of political problems.

Qatar's crude oil production declined only slightly in February after declining 18,000 bpd in January.

Saudi Arabia's January production was revised downward by 81.000 bpd. As a result, their production was down 578,000 bpd in January and another 68,000 bpd in February. They were also down 182,000 bpd in December. So, they are down a total of 828,000 bpd since their high in November.

UAE production was down 37,000 bpd in February after being down 128,000 bpd in January.

And the crude market may have an even bigger problem looming.

Russia.

New data Monday showed that Russian oil producers achieved a major milestone in 2016. Becoming the largest supplier of crude to energy-hungry China.

That came as Russian oil shipments to China rose 24% as compared to 2015 levels -- to an average 1.05 million barrels per day for the year. Inching Russia ahead of go-to supplier Saudi Arabia, which saw its exports to China average 1.02 million b/d in 2016.

That shift is happening as Saudi producers reportedly reigned in output under the OPEC production cuts agreed in late 2016. A move that likely played a big role in Saudi Arabia's China exports staying flat in 2016 -- despite overall Chinese demand for foreign oil hitting its highest level since 2010 during the year.

China's crude imports from Russia (white line) saw another big jump in 2016, while Saudi exports (blue) were flat

All of which suggests that Russia is shaping up as major challenge to OPEC dominance in the global oil market. With this world-leading producer being free from production quotas -- allowing it to grab market share while big OPEC producers like Saudi Arabia cut back output.

That's going to put pressure on OPEC to get back to business in pumping more oil. Which would in turn weigh on the oil price -- especially as former big producing nations like Libya make a return to the market.

The news of the Libyan oil pipeline blast sent WTI briefly above $60 a barrel on Wednesday.

Also on Wednesday, NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Reuters in a written reply to questions that ""It is estimated that the repair will take about one week from today.""

""This will not have a major effect in the marketing program, only a little change,"" Sanalla noted.

11402842,2017-08-24,"Libya's largest oilfield, the Sharara, remains offline despite contradictory news reports this morning suggesting that exports would resume.

Weighing in on oil price uncertainty, market watchers have been in a state of confusion over varying reports over the past three days as to the status of exports from Libya's biggest producing oilfield.

Earlier this morning, news reports citing National Oil Company (NOC) sources said production had resumed at Sharara, following a three-day blockade of the pipeline that feeds crude to Zawiya export terminal.

Reports said that the Tripoli-based NOC -- recognized by the UN as the legitimate NOC--announced it was lifting the force majeure on shipments of oil pumped from the country's largest oilfield -- the Sharara -- to the Zawiya port.

However, a Reuters report citing unnamed Libyan officials, the field remains offline for unclear reasons. The same report noted that operations had restarted yesterday at least once, for a short period.

""They open one valve, they close the other,"" one unnamed sources told Reuters. It was suggested that ""negotiations"" were underway for a resolution, though the nature of the problem remains undefined.

As rivalry between two governments, two 'national oil companies', a multitude of armed factions and ISIS continues, the future of Libyan exports remains highly uncertain.

The blockade was the latest in a string of disruptions that have suspended production at Sharara several times this year already.

Just two weeks ago, an attack on a control room at Zawiya caused the shutdown of production at Sharara. It later surfaced that the attackers were protesting the arrest of four Libyans in Saudi Arabia in connection to a kidnapping of Egyptian diplomats in Tripoli.

Sharara's production has also been interrupted by militants blocking the pipeline to Zawiya and theft of vehicles, which prompted NOC to tighten security.

Sharara pumps about 270,000/280,000 bpd and its restart last December has been key to Libya's oil output growth, which exceeds 1 million bpd. The field supplies around one-quarter of Libya's total output and has experienced several production stops since its restart.

Libya boasts the biggest crude oil reserves in Africa, but the civil war that ravaged the country after the removal of Muammar Gaddafi crippled its oil industry. Before the war, Libya produced 1.6 million barrels of crude daily. By the end of this year, the Tripoli-based NOC aims to hit a target of 1.2 million bpd - short of the pre-war rate but double the March 2017 daily average.

Rival factions in Libya's east have attempted to sell oil on their own through the Benghazi-based NOC, which is not recognized by United Nations Security Council, which views the Tripoli-based NOC as the only legitimate exporter of Libyan oil.

It is only a fragile alliance and an even more fragile game of balancing power that is keeping Libyan oil flowing. The Libyan National Army (LNA), headed by powerful General Khalifa Haftar, is aligned with the eastern government and parliament. Haftar is responsible for freeing up ports that had been blockaded for years and allowing the Tripoli-based NOC to export.

The reported beheading of 11 people at a central Libyan checkpoint controlled by Haftar's LNA on Wednesday also indicates that the conflict to control the country's oil wealth is further intensifying.",OilPrice.com,energy,,"['Zawiya, Libya', 'Libya', 'Tripoli', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Egypt']","Libya's Largest Oilfield Offline, Amid Uncertainty, ISIS Beheadings | OilPrice.com",http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Libyas-Largest-Oilfield-Offline-Amid-Uncertainty-ISIS-Beheadings.html,None,
11402843,2017-08-09,"More drama in embattled oil producer Libya this week. With reports suggesting the country's largest oil field has once again been endangered by local fighting.

Reuters reported early Monday that production at the Sharara field was grinding to a halt. With local sources saying that a key control room at the facility had been shut down.

The reason for the closure wasn't immediately clear. But Reuters did cite persons familiar with the situation as saying that an armed group had taken action against the facility -- potentially resulting in the shutdown.

At the time, sources said that Sharara's output was likely to decline to zero due to the problems at the control room. But reports emerged later in the day saying the problem had been fixed, and that production was now returning to normal.

Those reports confirmed that an armed group had been involved in action against the infrastructure here. With Libya's National Oil Company saying, ""The armed protesters were evacuated from the control room, pumping returned to its natural level and production is being restored.""

All of which is potentially critical news for the global crude market. With Sharara being the biggest part of Libya's recently-surging oil production -- putting out 270,000 barrels per day of Libya's total 1 million b/d output.

It looks as if problems here have been averted for the time being. But these events show things are still tenuous in Libya's oil sector -- evidenced by the fact an armed group was able to take over one of the country's key installations, even briefly.

11403146,2017-12-07,"The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed on Nov. 30 to persevere with supply curbs until the end of next year, in a bid to drain oversupplied world markets. In a surprise addition, an output cap was imposed on members Libya and Nigeria, which had previously been spared any obligations while they struggled to recover barrels lost to armed conflict and sabotage.

The pact seemed to be a reversal for Libya, whose top oil official, Mustafa Sanalla, had outlined the country's aspirations to revive exports and its need for leniency while nation rebuilding took place.

Yet in practice, the production cap of about 1 MMbpd imposes little constraint on Tripoli, which is barely able to push output any higher, consultants Eurasia Group and Wood Mackenzie say. Libya plans to abide by the target next year, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public.

""The OPEC quota doesn't matter,"" said Riccardo Fabiani, an analyst at Eurasia Group. ""Moving beyond 1 MMbpd in 2018 is going to be very difficult anyway.""

With a fragile political accord barely holding the country together, Libya faces an array of challenges preventing its return to the output levels of about 1.6 MMbpd pumped before the 2011 uprising against Muammar Qaddafi.

Potential threats

Pipelines and other facilities are targeted by armed factions and tribal groups jostling for political control and a share of oil revenues.

""It would be an achievement in itself if Libya was able to maintain current rates of production,"" said Martijn Murphy, research manager for North African upstream at Wood Mackenzie. ""There's still no central unity government, and so the potential for violence to flare is acute, and the threat of militias and tribes shutting down oil pipelines, valves or ports is ongoing.""

One of the biggest constraints for Libya is financial as National Oil Corp. struggles to pay suppliers and engineers and do necessary maintenance, Fabiani said. NOC chairman Sanalla said in London in October that the company was receiving only 25% of its stipulated investment budget.

Russia, which set aside decades of rivalry with OPEC to join the production deal, had pressed the organization to impose caps on Libya and Nigeria. While the two countries were exempt from the accord hammered out last winter, the recovery in their output this year undermined the efforts of fellow producers to eliminate a global oil glut.

Output pledge

Details on the terms were scarce even as OPEC's meeting concluded in Vienna, with no reference to the cap made in the cartel's closing statement or a notice issued afterward by Libya's NOC. There is a confidential document that commits Nigeria and Libya to limit their production to the highest level reached this year, without citing any figures, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because that pledge will be kept private.

Libya and Nigeria are to restrict their combined production to no more than 2.8 MMbpd, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said after last week's meeting in Vienna.

The two countries said they won't exceed their production peaks of 2017, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said after the same session. Their highest output levels recorded this year are 1.01 MMbpd for Libya and 1.77 MMbpd for Nigeria, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Despite the challenges it faces, Libya might be able to pump slightly more next year, Wood Mackenzie's Murphy said. Still, that would require rehabilitation of its main export terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, and the development of oil fields in the west and south of the country, he said.

Both Wood Mackenzie and Eurasia said they expect that, if Libya can increase production next year, it will do so, regardless of the agreement with OPEC. Other members of the organization, particularly Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, have flouted the output limits to which they submitted.

11403147,2017-12-06,"CAIRO and LONDON (Bloomberg) -- OPEC appeared to score a diplomatic coup last week by persuading Libya, its most troubled member, to accept production limits. In reality, the agreement probably means little for the oil market.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed on Nov. 30 to persevere with supply curbs until the end of next year, in a bid to drain oversupplied world markets. In a surprise addition, an output cap was imposed on members Libya and Nigeria, which had previously been spared any obligations while they struggled to recover barrels lost to armed conflict and sabotage.

The pact seemed to be a reversal for Libya, whose top oil official, Mustafa Sanalla, had outlined the country's aspirations to revive exports and its need for leniency while nation rebuilding took place.

Yet in practice, the production cap of about 1 MMbopd imposes little constraint on Tripoli, which is barely able to push output any higher, consultants Eurasia Group and Wood Mackenzie say. Libya plans to abide by the target next year, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information isn't public.

""The OPEC quota doesn't matter,"" said Riccardo Fabiani, an analyst at Eurasia Group. ""Moving beyond 1 million barrels a day in 2018 is going to be very difficult anyway.""

With a fragile political accord barely holding the country together, Libya faces an array of challenges preventing its return to the output levels of about 1.6 MMbopd pumped before the 2011 uprising against Muammar Qaddafi.

Potential threats

Pipelines and other facilities are targeted by armed factions and tribal groups jostling for political control and a share of oil revenues.

""It would be an achievement in itself if Libya was able to maintain current rates of production,"" said Martijn Murphy, research manager for North African upstream at Wood Mackenzie. ""There's still no central unity government, and so the potential for violence to flare is acute, and the threat of militias and tribes shutting down oil pipelines, valves or ports is ongoing.""

One of the biggest constraints for Libya is financial as National Oil Corp. struggles to pay suppliers and engineers and conduct necessary maintenance, Fabiani said. NOC chairman Sanalla said in London in October that the company was receiving only 25% of its stipulated investment budget.

Russia, which set aside decades of rivalry with OPEC to join the production deal, had pressed the organization to impose caps on Libya and Nigeria. While the two countries were exempt from the accord hammered out last winter, the recovery in their output this year undermined the efforts of fellow producers to eliminate a global oil glut.

Output pledge

Details on the terms were scarce even as OPEC's meeting concluded in Vienna, with no reference to the cap made in the cartel's closing statement or a notice issued afterward by Libya's NOC. There is a confidential document that commits Nigeria and Libya to limit their production to the highest level reached this year, without citing any figures, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because that pledge will be kept private.

Libya and Nigeria are to restrict their combined production to no more than 2.8 MMbopd, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said after last week's meeting in Vienna.

Despite the challenges the country faces, Libya might be able to pump slightly more next year, Wood Mackenzie's Murphy said. Still, that would require rehabilitation of its main export terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, and the development of oil fields in the west and south of the country, he said.

Both Wood Mackenzie and Eurasia said they expect that, if Libya can increase production next year, it will do so, regardless of the agreement with OPEC. Other members of the organization, particularly Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, have flouted the production limits they submitted to.

11403148,2017-07-19,"LONDON (Bloomberg) -- Libya's rebounding oil output is undermining the supply curbs masterminded by Saudi Arabia and Russia. But any pleas for the OPEC member to exercise restraint will probably be resisted by the technocrat overseeing the North African nation's turnaround.

Production has climbed to a four-year high of 1.1 MMbpd, with Libya adding output since April that's equivalent to more than a quarter of the cuts agreed by OPEC and its allies.

The restoration of Libyan oil supply has put the spotlight on National Oil Corp. Chairman Mustafa Sanalla, whose influence has waxed in a country divided between a weak United Nations-backed government in the west and a military strongman in the east. When OPEC meets with Russia in St. Petersburg this week, the 56-year-old petrochemical engineer will speak for a nation that's causing as much angst as U.S. shale drillers.

""Sanalla has become the central figure in the oil and gas sector,"" Geoff Porter, founder of the North Africa Risk Consulting, said in an interview. ""His job is to produce as much oil as possible while he can and I think that's what he is going to continue to try to do.""

When OPEC, Russia and other producers agreed last December to cut production to boost prices, Libya easily secured an exemption. The nation with Africa's biggest oil reserves was pumping about 500,000 bpd of crude, less than a third of its pre-conflict capacity.

Libya was off the radar, skipping OPEC meetings and not providing the group with monthly production data. Now, with output surpassing the symbolic 1 MMbpd mark, OPEC members want Libya at the table in St. Petersburg. While it's unclear if Libya will send a representative to the ministers' meeting on July 24, Sanalla will attend a technical meeting two days earlier.

Libya will share with the committee ""the factors enabling and constraining"" its recovery in output, Sanalla said in a statement on Tuesday.

Libyan Challenges

As for joining the supply curbs and while Ecuador deals a blow to OPEC unity, Sanalla has previously hinted that Libya's challenges won't make that easy.

""Libya's political, humanitarian and economic situation needs to be taken into account if we are going to talk about production caps,"" Sanalla said in a July 11 statement, following suggestions from other OPEC members that the country could be asked to curb output.

Sanalla's growing stature in a divided country -- General Khalifa Haftar controls eastern Libya and vies for power with the UN-backed Tripoli-based government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj -- was on display last month in an opinion piece in the New York Times, where he urged the NOC to remain aloof from the nation's internal politics.

With the NYT piece and the nation's surging oil output, Sanalla ""demonstrated to the other stakeholders in Libya that he has the international standing that almost anyone else lacks,"" said Mattia Toaldo, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Power Broker

""Sanalla is a mix between a diplomat-in-chief and an oil minister in the Saudi tradition, who used to do big diplomacy mostly through oil,"" Toaldo said.

Last month, Sanalla met with both Algeria's energy and foreign affairs ministers, discussing how Algeria could help unify belligerent factions ""to stabilize the country and its economy,"" according to the state-owned Algerian Press Service.

Sanalla, who was born in 1961 in the eastern city of Benghazi and is today working at the NOC headquarters in the capital in the west, has sought to remain neutral through Libya's political turmoil. After a career in state refineries, he took over the NOC leadership in May 2014. He is credited for reasserting the authority of the Tripoli-based NOC against attempts by eastern parties to sell oil independently. Under his tenure, Libya has signed contracts with international companies, ended a blockade of its ports and increased production more than fourfold from 250,000 bpd.

Indeed, rather than capping production, the head of the state-owned oil company is more concerned about boosting output further. When Russia's Rosneft PJSC signed a deal in February to invest in exploration and production in Libya, the NOC said it was part of its goal to increase output to 2.1 MMbpd by 2020.

Economic Driver

That determination to increase oil output stems from the economic hardship Libya has experienced since the state collapsed following the 2011 revolution that toppled dictator Moammar Al- Qaddafi.

The economy has contracted for the past three years, a distinction it shares only with Yemen -- a country engulfed in a civil war -- among 11 oil exporters tracked by the International Monetary Fund in the region spanning the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Libya is the only OPEC member in the Middle East and North Africa to have seen the oil price it needs to balance its budget increase since 2014.

While Sanalla has ambitions to boost production, the country may already be bumping up against a short-term ""implicit"" ceiling that's slightly above 1 MMbpd, according to Toaldo. Until investment raises capacity further, that means a cap at around that level might be possible, he said.

Labor unrest and political violence also loom over the nation's ability to sustain output, said Porter of North Africa Risk Consulting. Much also hinges on the NOC boss himself.

""Production is exposed to a range of downside risks,"" he said. ""It appears that the entire sector depends on Sanalla.""",World Oil Online,energy,,"['Russia', 'Libya', 'Saint Petersburg', 'Saudi Arabia', 'United States', 'Ecuador', 'Algeria', 'Benghazi', 'Yemen', 'Pakistan', 'Afghanistan']","Libya's ascendant oil boss poses challenge for OPEC, Russia",http://www.worldoil.com/news/2017/7/19/libyas-ascendant-oil-boss-poses-challenge-for-saudi-arabia-russia,None,

Cairo- Libyan parliamentary and academic figures expressed ""a conditional welcome"" to the Libyan ""roadmap,"" which was presented by United Nations Envoy to Libya Ghassan Salameh before the UN General Assembly in New York, pointing out that the success of this plan is linked to the compliance of the dialogue committees to amend the political agreement without objections.

Salameh outlined an action plan of three phases to resolve the crisis in the country. The first phase will start next week and will include amending the political agreement, which was signed in Skhirat in December 2015.

The second phase is a national conference held under the auspices of the United Nations and which will bring together the ""marginalized actors"" of the Libyan scene in order to launch a dialogue with armed groups in order to integrate their members into the political process.

The third phase, according to the roadmap, is to hold a referendum to adopt a new constitution within a year, which will pave the way to general presidential and parliamentary elections.

Member of the Libyan parliament's dialogue committee, Issa al-Oreibi, welcomed the UN roadmap and told Asharq Al-Awsat: ""We have to take advantage of this opportunity to get out of this crisis and enjoy stability in our country.""

""The Skhirat agreement has several points that need to be amended, including article 8, which must be abolished to unite the army,"" Oreibi added.

""The plan included expanding the participation of all Libyan figures who want to engage in the political and executive process, which is something good,"" he added.

""We have prominent political figures in the far east and west, who have been marginalized from political participation, and the day when Libya can benefit from their expertise has come.""

He described the UN roadmap saying that it includes a solution away from using weapons and militias for political purposes.

The majority of the members of the House of Representatives support the UN solution, except for few who have reservations on the second phase of the ""plan,"" concerning ""holding a national conference under the auspices of the United Nations to integrate the untouchable or marginalized actors in Libya.""

Regarding the part, which includes holding talks with armed groups, Oreibi said that the militias in Libya are divided into two groups. The first group are like ISIS, ""whom we fought against in Sirte and some other cities,"" and the second group are unarmed militias in the far west of the country, ""whom we can hold talks with to integrate their members in the political process"".

This summer has seen a flurry of summits and meetings on Libya. On 25 July, Paris hosted a meeting between Sarraj and Haftar. Last week, Brazzaville hosted a meeting of the African Union with Prime Minister Faiez Sarraj, Speaker of the House of Representatives Aghila Saleh and Chairman of the High State Council Abdul Rahman Swehli attending. This week, foreign ministers and top diplomats of the US, UK, France, Italy, Egypt and the UAE met in London to discuss Libya with the new UN Special Representative Ghassan Salameh.

The most important meeting will take place next week in New York, on the margins of the UN General Assembly. Salameh is expected to present his plan to move the political process forward to the ministers of the countries most interested in Libya, including many Arab countries. His main challenge will be to resist pressure from ministers and heads of government to produce results in the short term and instead focus on a solid strategy that includes both a political process and efforts at stabilization and de-escalation.

Since starting his work in late July, Salameh has approached the Libyan file with caution and an open mind. Rather than making grand statements, he has travelled throughout Libya meeting hundreds of Libyans apart from the big political and military names. He was already familiar with the country because of his academic activity but his recent tour and the meetings with Haftar and other important stakeholders have probably injected a further note of caution in his approach.

The agenda for him was set by the work of his predecessor Martin Kobler and most importantly by the negotiations conducted between Cairo and Abu Dhabi since December 2016. First, to include Haftar and his supporters in the existing Libyan Political Agreement (also known as the Skhirat agreement), he must help the House of Representatives and the High Council of State negotiate a number of amendments to the agreement. Once amended the agreement, the same parties will have to make the appointments in the main institutions. This should lead, according to the joint declaration agreed by Haftar and Sarraj in Paris in July, to elections in early 2018. Meanwhile, the Libyan Constitutional Drafting Assembly based in Bayda has approved a draft constitution in August and in theory this should be submitted to a referendum in the coming months.

Getting all these elements in the right sequence is the first challenge for Salameh but the biggest one is navigating the apparent agreement of all the major stakeholders on this plan and the reality of big divisions on its implementation. For example, while everyone agrees that the Agreement should be amended to create the figure of the Prime Minister and to reduce the Presidency Council from nine to three members, the different factions have radically different ideas on who should cover those positions and even on how they should be allocated.

Secondly, while paying lip service to reforming the agreement, some figures have all the interest in perpetuating the status quo. All changes should go through the House of Representatives headed by Aghila Saleh, but he has shown over and over that he has no interest in changing the current situation in which he has considerable power also vis-à-vis Haftar. So either Aghila stops the reform from moving forward in the House of Representatives or even if this is approved, it would take a long time to agree on the new names. And this would be temporary names in view of the elections.

Elections are a big question mark as it is unclear whether Aghila would quickly approve the law that is required to hold them. And of course, it is unclear if elections would be both for parliament and for president. Haftar has made it clear that he would like to run for president, but it is unclear how one could hold such elections without a constitution stating the powers of the new office. Since 2011, Libya has not had a President of the Republic, not even a temporary one.

To reduce Aghila's veto power on any agreement, the process would need to take the reform of the House of Representatives seriously. This is crucial if any roadmap is to be approved and if the Libyan government is to work according to rules and institutions. Currently, the meetings of parliament with the highest attendance gather only half of the members and the House has been unable to approve anything significant in the last year. Brokering a compromise to reintegrate all members of parliament will have to be part of the plan, perhaps including the move to a more neutral location than Aghila's ""fiefdom"" in Tobruk.

All of this will require time, much more than the few months from now until early 2018. Salameh, with the cooperation of concerned countries, must be empowered to work also on stabilization of Libya even in the absence of a big political agreement. This means having a government in charge of public services, a recognized Central Bank and an economic process to share the wealth of the country alongside mechanisms to avoid military escalation, rebuild Benghazi, ensure the return of the internally displaced and address the humanitarian crisis particularly in the south.

Ultimately, Ghassan Salameh can only do this if there is, from the side of Libyan leaders, willingness to compromise and focus on solutions. The Libyan social fabric made of activists, mayors, notables and tribal leaders has often demonstrated a more constructive behavior than military and political leaders. Choosing the right mix between these components will be key but before that Salameh will need to get the right support from international leaders in New York. The message should be to do well, not quickly on the political process while showing a commitment to address the humanitarian issues that affect the daily lives of Libyans.

Cairo- Russia had announced Tuesday that it supports the efforts exerted by Commander of Libyan National Army (LNA) Khalifa Haftar's forces to combat terrorism while Haftar stressed his determination to continue the fight against terrorism until the liberation of all cities in Libya.

Haftar's office said in a statement on Tuesday that the Russian message was received during his meeting with the Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu in the latter's headquarter in Moscow.

The statement said that Shoigu expressed his appreciation for the great sacrifices made by the national army in the fight against terrorism and congratulated the Libyan leader and the Libyans for liberating the city of Benghazi from terrorist groups.

Shoigu stressed the Russian leadership will stand by the Libyan armed forces in their fight against terrorism in order to achieve security and stability in Libya and its regional surrounding, according to the statement.

Meanwhile, Fatou Bensouda, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), announced the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf al-Werfalli, a senior Libyan military commander allied with Khalifa Haftar.

""I filed an under seal application with Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC for a warrant of arrest to be issued against al-Werfalli, a Major in the al-Saiqa forces, on charges of murder as a war crime under the Rome Statute for his direct participation in seven separate rounds of executions, in which a total of 33 people were murdered in cold blood in Benghazi or surrounding areas,"" Bensouda said in a statement.

""Such egregious crimes, including the cruel and dehumanizing manner by which they were perpetrated against helpless victims, must be stopped. Accountability for atrocity crimes is better suited to advance the ends of peace and stability, not more violence,"" the statement said.

Bensouda added that the Pre-Trial Chamber granted her request and issued a warrant of arrest against al-Werfalli, and that her office's pursuit of justice and the fight against impunity in Libya continues.

However, she expressed concern that the challenge now is the execution of the warrant of arrest and the surrender of al-Werfalli to the custody of the ICC.

Bensouda also appealed to the international community to cooperate and assist Libya, as needed, to ensure the arrest and surrender of al-Werfalli to the ICC without delay and equally called on the UNSC to support such efforts.

For his part, newly-appointed UN envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame visited Libya's third largest city of Misrata on Tuesday and held talks with political and community leaders of the city.

Salame, the special representative of the UN Secretary-General and head of the UN Support Mission in Libya, met with officials of Misrata's Municipal Council, community leaders and Misrata University students, and he discussed the city's needs and future vision.

He also commended Misrata's contribution to fighting terrorism, efforts to build one united, sovereign Libya and sacrifices made by the city's residents to achieve stability and security across Libya. He stressed that Libya can emerge from the crisis despite challenges ahead.

Addressing the students in Misrata University, Salame vowed to be unbiased and to find a new mechanism for dialogue among the Libyan conflicting parties so that they reach a consensus to amend the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA).

Moscow- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov discussed the situation in Libya with Libyan National Army Commander Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar currently on official visit to Russia.

Both officials reiterated that all mediation efforts in Libya should be carried out via the UN.

Haftar stated that he is seeking military aid from Russia to Libyan forces fighting terrorists and extremists.

He said the issue of potential Russian military aid to Libya was discussed with Lavrov, adding that Russia is a ""good friend"" of Libya. He reiterated his intentions to further develop relations with Moscow in various fields, hailing its position concerning the Libyan crisis.

""The outcome of the talks is very positive. We briefed [Lavrov] on our problems, described the picture in whole. Naturally, Russian side considers how it can participate in the search for the required decisions. We'd be delighted, if Russia continues to participate in this work,"" Haftar told journalists after the meeting with Lavrov.

He also stated that the Libyan army is doing its best to fight terrorism and has been making sacrifices for the past three years despite unfair sanctions on armament.

Haftar, however, stated that his country is adamant on continuing its battle until the Libyan army is in control of all Libyan territories.

When asked about the political process in Libya, Haftar said following requests from neighboring countries he initiated to meet with Prime Minister of the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) Fayez Sarraj in Abu Dhabi, UAE, earlier this year. He explained that despite agreeing on several issues with Sarraj, the latter never committed to the deal.

Last month, Haftar and Sarraj agreed on a plan to take Libya out of its crisis during anotehr meeting in France under the patronage of French President Emmanuel Macron.

Russia has expressed its readiness to work toward achieving a successful political solution to the Libyan crisis, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday in the follow-up to the meeting between Lavrov and Haftar.

""Russia's continued readiness to further contribute to the successful advancement of the political process in Libya in contact with all of Libya's sides was confirmed,"" the statement said.

Russia underscored the importance of continued inclusive intra-Libyan dialogue with the participation of the representatives of all major political powers, tribal groups and regions of the country to reach mutually acceptable decisions, aimed at ensuring the sustainable development of Libya as a united, sovereign and independent state.

Russia supports the intention of Commander Haftar to reach an agreement with Sarraj, Lavrov said.

""We are aware of the efforts being made with your participation, with the participation of Sarraj, which are aimed at ensuring generally acceptable agreements on optimal ways of implementing the Skhirat agreement,"" the FM told Haftar.

He added that Moscow expects Special Representative and Head of UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) Ghassan Saleme to visit Russia soon.

Following the meeting with Lavrov, Haftar held talks with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.

The talks focused ""on the developments in North Africa and mainly the situation in Libya,"" the Russian defense ministry said in a brief statement, noting that both sides emphasized the importance of continued bilateral dialogue.

Russia is trying to communicate with all parties in Libya which would enable it to have a more influential role on the situation in the country.

Earlier in March, Sarraj met with Lavrov who said that Russia wants to see Libya united, prosperous and supported by reliable state institutions and a capable army.

Lavrov believed it is in the interests of the Libyans themselves that regional stability and promoting conditions are bolstered for the resumption of relations between Libya and all its partners, including Russia.

""We are convinced that the current crisis can be overcome only by the Libyan people and all the Libyan parties through an inclusive, as is commonly said, nationwide dialogue aimed at reconciliation,"" stated Lavrov.

Sarraj reiterated the strong relations between Russia and Libya, saying he is keen on establishing relations political, economic, security and military fields.

Prior to Haftar's current visit to Russia, news reports stated that Sarraj might simultaneously arrive in Moscow.

Head of the Russian contact group on the settlement in Libya Lev Dingov said that both Haftar and Sarraj will visit Moscow on Monday. But the news was soon denied by the ministry which said that only the LNA chief would be visiting.

Cairo- Libyan National Army chief Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar on Thursday ordered naval units to confront Italian warships in territorial waters despite growing fears of clashes erupting.

Haftar's order came a day after Rome launched a mission to counter migrant smuggling from Libya.

Haftar's office said his instructions were issued late in the evening, just hours after the arrival of an Italian navy boat to the coast of Tripoli.

Libyan naval bases in Tobruk, Benghazi, Ras Lanuf and Tripoli were ordered to intercept any foreign maritime warship entering the African country's regional waters that are not authorized by the Libyan armed forces. The order does not include licensed trade foreign vessels.

According to local newspapers, the Italian government downplayed most threats made by Haftar, dismissing them as ""mere propaganda,"" saying ""there is no real danger.""

However, government sources were quoted as saying that the Italian government and the interior, defense and foreign affairs ministries are following the situation closely.

Italy's Interior Minister Marco Minniti believes that reconciliation between warring Libyan parties remains a priority for a sustainable settlement.

""If NGOs do not sign up (to a new code of conduct), it is difficult to see how they can continue operating,"" Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.

Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.

Other Diplomats say there is a low risk of armed confrontation, since the LNA operates in eastern and central Libya, while the migrant-smuggling area is from western ports under control of the GNA led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

Italy insists its naval craft will support Libyan naval units who will intercept migrant-smuggling craft close to Libya's coast, and says there are no plans for Italian warships to take a direct role in the operation.

11403959,2017-08-02,"Cairo - Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni stressed on Tuesday that a potential Italian mission dispatched to Libya to back its coast guard would be aimed at controlling the border against human trafficking.

On its Twitter account, the Italian embassy in Libya quoted Gentiloni as saying that an army cannot be sent to Libya. A mission to support Libyan authorities, primarily coast guards, can be sent instead to monitor the border.

Gentiloni made his remarks ahead of a parliament vote that was set to address the possible mission.

Libyan Prime Minister of the UN-backed unity government in Tripoli Fayez Sarraj made the request for Italian naval help while in Rome on Wednesday. The visit came after Sarraj met his rival, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, in France last week. They both agreed on a ceasefire and possible national elections in Libya.

Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano briefed the Lower House and Senate defense and foreign affairs committees that the potential mission to Libya would fall into Italy's comprehensive approach to try to bring peace to the North African country.

""Libyan unity and stability coincide with Italy's national interest, and the request of support was born in a climate of absolute and mutual trust,"" he told lawmakers.

Alfano also pointed out Italy wants to avoid fragmentation in the diplomatic efforts of the international community to bring peace to Libya.

The minister stressed that Italy aims at tracing all of the recent unilateral initiatives on Libya back to a common factor, and focus all efforts on supporting the action of the new UN special envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salameh.

He hoped the peace agreement driven by French President Emmanuel Macron would succeed, adding that it should be UN supported.

Speaking before the same committees, Italian Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti said that the government's proposed naval mission to support the Libyan coast guard's efforts against human traffickers does not harm Tripoli's sovereignty in any way, adding: ""Our aim is to reinforce it"".

Pinotti stressed that the government's proposed naval mission to support Libya stemmed from a July 23 letter from Sarraj requesting ""naval and technical support"". She said Rome would provide this via ""technical, logistical and operative support to Libyan naval units accompanying them with joint, coordinated activities.""

Tripoli and Rome had agreed to ""complete its (Italy's) support program for (Libya's) coastguard through training and armament to allow it to save migrants' lives and to confront the criminal (trafficking) gangs"", the GNA said in a statement.

Sarraj ""denies having asked Italy to send naval vessels into Libya's territorial waters... or fighter planes into Libyan airspace,"" it said.

""Such allegations... are without any foundation,"" Sarraj was quoted as saying in the statement. ""Libya's national sovereignty is a red line that nobody must cross.""

Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday that a government plan to deploy vessels in Libyan territorial waters would be presented to parliament in Rome next week.

The cabinet was ""discussing the details"" of a request from Tripoli for assistance, he said.

His statement came as the European Union has announced 46 million euros ($53 million) in funding to help boost Libya's border and coast guards, as part of moves to stem the flow of migrants leaving the country's shores heading for Europe.

The UN Security Council also welcomed this week's meeting of the rival Libyan leaders and urged all Libyans to support a negotiated political solution, national reconciliation and an immediate ceasefire.

French President Emmanuel Marcron hosted a meeting Tuesday at which Sarraj and military leader Gen. Khalifa Haftar committed themselves to a ceasefire.

They also agreed to work toward presidential and parliamentary elections and to find a roadmap for securing their lawless country against terrorism and trafficking.

The Security Council underscored the importance of the UN's central role in facilitating a Libyan-led political dialogue and welcomed new UN envoy Ghassan Salame.

It said in a statement that it looks forward ""to supporting his efforts to facilitate a political solution in Libya.""

In their 10-point joint declaration, Sarraj and Haftar also agreed to work on unifying national institutions such as the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and the central bank.

Salame on Friday lauded the efforts exerted by NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla.

Sanalla and tens of thousands of administrative staff, engineers and Libyan oil workers have worked to quadruple production in a couple of months despite all the challenges, Salame tweeted.

Paris- French President Emmanuel Macron seems interested in playing an active political and diplomatic role in the international scene, including the Middle East and the Arab world, a month after reaching the Elysee palace.

According to high-ranking diplomats, Macron wants France to have its say in the Syrian conflict, the war on terrorism, the crisis in the Gulf and the Libyan file.

Regarding the war in Syria, Macron wants his country to launch a new political and diplomatic initiative that is in the making. As for the war on terror, Paris is closely involved in the Raqqa battle as it sees that French or former resident ""extremists"" are there and the mission of French special forces is to prevent them from returning to France and carrying out terrorist attacks.

On the Libyan file, Macron has assigned French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to communicate with influential regional parties who could affect warring sides in Libya. So the minister recently visited Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria.

The French FM also contacted involved Gulf parties and is expected to visit Moscow on June 20.

The Gulf file remains the most delicate and it has a different nature. Sources told Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that Macron is dedicated to containing the Qatari crisis.

France abstained from saying that it is carrying out a mediation between Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt from one side and Qatar from the other, but it stressed that it backs the Kuwaiti mediation based on the principle that ""the Gulf is capable of resolving its issues.""

Paris believes that the Middle East has its shares of wars and crises and doesn't need a new crisis. It also believes in containing conflicts, maintaining stability and consolidating the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a move that is highly important for the war on terrorism.

11403963,2017-06-02,"Cairo - The National Human Rights Committee in Libya demanded on Thursday that an international investigation be launched in ""Qatar's interference and financial and military support for extremists groups and organizations"" in the country.

Commander of the Libyan National Army Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar for his part condemned ""Qatar's terrorist activity on Libyan land,"" vowing that it will not go unpunished.

The Committee accused Qatar of backing several local militias, including the al-Qaeda-linked Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna and Ansar al-Sharia-allied Benghazi Rebels Shura Council. It said that these militias participated in assassinations against hundreds of officers, policemen and soldiers, as well as a number of civilian, media and rights figures in the eastern region.

Qatar is stoking the conflict in Libya through its support of extremist armed groups and political powers that are practicing political violence, added the human rights committee.

This backing has increased the danger and threat of terrorist groups and organizations in Libya, it said.

Qatar's meddling in Libya's internal affairs since 2011 has fueled the armed conflict and dragged the country towards civil war and exacerbated the security and humanitarian suffering, it added.

""Qatar's interference is a blatant violation of the Arab League and United Nations charters in regards to ties between countries and their respect of sovereignty and independence,"" it stressed.

Hafter's media office meanwhile distributed a poster with his photograph that was taken during a military parade held in the eastern region in April. ""The terrorist activity that Qatar has carried out on Libyan territories will not go unpunished,"" said a statement on the poster.

His office did not say whether the statement was taken from a speech Haftar had delivered during the parade or whether it was a new threat against Qatar.

Haftar had recently delivered a message to the commanders of the army, accusing Qatar and other countries of presenting financial support to terrorist groups in his country.

He stated that the army is monitoring foreign Chadian, Sudanese, African and Arab delegations in the country. These groups had initially arrived there due to poor border control by regional and international powers that support terrorism.

Some of these delegations received sums of money from Qatar and other countries, as well as terrorists active in Libya, he added.

Haftar had since the fall of the regime of Moammar al-Gadhafi in 2011 accused Qatar of backing extremist and terrorist groups. He also said that it has played a negative role in Libya and should be held accountable for its actions.

Meanwhile, the presidential council of the national consensus government announced the establishment of seven military zones in each of Tripoli, Benghazi, Tobruk, al-Kafra, Sabha and two central and western regions.

This controversial step may deepen the disputes with Haftar over the eastern part of the country.

The council, chaired by Fayez al- Sarraj and backed by the United Nations mission, did not explain the reasons that led it to establish the military zones. It was the first time Sarraj signed a decree in his role of high commander of the Libyan army.

In a related development, Haftar's press office issued a statement that stresses the need to eliminate terrorist groups from al-Jafra region. Sarraj had said that the developments in the area are ""unacceptable"".

The military escalation there could lead to the entire failure of the political process, he warned.

In his first comments on Egypt's airstrikes against terrorist camps in al-Jafra in central Libya, he remarked that he is continuing necessary contacts to restore calm and end the shelling.

He made his statement after holding talks in the capital Tripoli with a delegation from the city of Hun.

He called on ""all sides to exercise restraint, halt the military escalation and sit at a dialogue table.""

""The military escalation hinders serious attempts to achieve agreement between the sons of the nation and results in reactions that may lead the country to a new whirlwind of violence and deepen division,"" Sarraj declared.

The delegation was informed of the real developments in Hun and Jafra and the damage done by the airstrikes against the infrastructure and public and private properties, said his media office.

For its part, the delegation said that the strikes had struck fear among the people like no other development ever has.

""The Jafra region has never been and will never be a side in the conflict. It has always been a meeting point for all parties due to its location in central Libya,"" it stressed.

The residents of al-Jafra had taken to the streets in Hun, demanding that the ""Benghazi Defense Brigades"" evacuate the area because these militias have destabilized the region.

The protesters carried banners condemning the Muslim Brotherhood and sacked Mufti Sadeq al-Gharyani.

Sarraj later revealed that French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will soon make an urgent trip to Tripoli at the head of diplomatic delegation.

French President Emmanuel Macron had pledged during a telephone conversation with Sarraj to return his country's diplomatic mission to Libya.

Macron renewed his country's support for Libya and Sarraj's government, stressing France's keenness on establishing security and stability based on political agreement. He added that Paris will work with its European partners in order to help Tripoli overcome its political and security challenges.

11403964,2017-05-12,"As the US President complained to Russian Foreign minister over Iran's attitude and the importance of suppressing it, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was publicly warning citizens that ""they want to change Iran's attitude and this means changing our regime"".

Tehran is undergoing an internal concern of change and Khamenei was right when he described the change of the regime's attitude as dangerous on the state. Change is a tough process but it is the bitter medicine because the regime is old on the level of ideas and not years - the regime fits the Cold War period but not the age of competing markets.

He sees that danger lies in politicians who praise the people and grant them development and change promises during elections. The supreme leader expresses rejection, ""we will not change,"" and ignores the change of circumstances, succession of generations and the rise of ambitions.

Candidates want to gain electors' support and they promise of positive change - which is rejected and seen as dangerous by the regime guards.

There are world powers and region countries also complaining that Iran did not change. It still has the same policy established by Khomeini - at the beginning of his term - the policy of revolutions and wars in the region. For this reason, he established and supported local groups.

He built a network of agents that do filthy actions on his behalf. It started with hijacking airplanes' operations, kidnapping and killing diplomats and academics and attempting to control local authorities in the targeted countries. This is Iran's policy until today.

When the US administration complained over the Iranian attitude, it was complaining over a situation that has been there for a while. It is the reason behind chaos and tension in the region. Pressure put on Iran's political regime is increasing to change its attitude and cope with the new world.

In fact, the greatest danger does not come from US or regional enemies but from the Iranian interior.

Tehran's authorities are worried that elections might go out of their hands just like in 2009, although the political process is already designed in the official framework, whether through allowing the pro-regime only to run for the elections, limiting electoral letters or even controlling the media and sorting ballots.

The challenges that the old regime in Tehran is facing are represented in rejecting to deal in a realistic manner with the change of generations. Majority of the world's regimes have changed and are coping with their surroundings.

China, for example, maintained its regime but changed its methods - it let go the ideological legality and adopted the recent modern administration and the legality of the economic achievement. Vietnam - the most famous country to fight an ideology - changed and opened up to the world even on the level of enmity with the US.

Iran should learn from Arab regimes that refused to change and then collapsed, starting from Saddam in Iraq to Qaddafi in Libya, Saleh in Yemen and Assad who is suffering in Syria.

This strictness in ideology, political demagogy and the centralism of the security and military project will lead Iran to collapse. It will suffer foreign crises for adopting wars' projects in Iraq, Syria and Yemen and for its support to extremist armed religious groups in Bahrain, Pakistan and others.

Also, the internal condition in Iran can't be controlled by the authority of religious men who object over the youth's ambitions; the majority of population. Candidates tried to attract Iranian voters by openness' promises but Khamenei called them not to open this door.

This electoral conflict unveils the social and mental changes and reveals expectations of the Iranian people that the regime is trying to put an end for.

11403965,2017-04-19,"Cairo - Leader of the Libyan National Army (LNA) Marshal Khalifa Haftar has once again rejected calls made by Libyan Prime Minister of Government of National Accord (GNA) Fayez al-Sarraj to end military operations to liberate the South of armed militias, instead assigning a commander for the southern military area.

Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni is expected to discuss the Libyan crisis in his first summit with Donald Trump since the US President took office in January.

Algeria is also playing its part in attempts to resolve the Libyan crisis.

Algerian Minister of State Abdul Qader Msahel is expected to begin his trip to Libya on Wednesday during which he will visit several cities, according to a Foreign Ministry statement.

The statement mentioned that Msahel's visit is part of the continuous efforts exerted by Algeria to reach a political solution through a comprehensive Libyan dialogue and national reconciliation.

On the battlefield, the LNA air force targeted third force militias located near Tamnhant airbase in the south of the country, where the military besieges militias inside the airbase most of which are loyal to Sarraj's government, including the militias loyal to Chadian opposition and the city of Sirte.

Leader of Shield of South brigade Ahmed al-Hasnawi, who is loyal to Sarraj's GNA, said army troops shelled the airbase, while Brigade 201 spokesperson said the base was targeted with over 20 howitzer-152 projectiles.

Spokesperson of Sarraj government's militias Mohammed al-Ghosari said that Haftar's end, which will start in southern Libya, is nearing. He stated that the so-called international intervention force will target the troops and air force of the Libyan National Army in the South.

Ghosari added that the ministry of defense of Sarraj's government had requested a no-fly zone over southern Libya.

Haftar, who heads the LNA that is loyal to the internationally recognized parliament, ordered the formation of a main operations room for the air force of the general directorate of the army in Benina airbase in Benghazi, eastern Libya.

Haftar had instructed General Pilot Mohammed al-Manfoor to lead the operations room and create additional rooms in areas of al-Akhdar Mountain, central, western and southern Libya. He also assigned Brigadier Khalifa al-Taher Khalifa Milad commander of the southern military area.

Haftar's decisions came at a time the European Union warned that the escalating violence and clashes are threatening the political process and jeopardizing the lives of Libyan civilians.

""Libyans deserve peace and stability, and expect all sides to refrain from violence and take measures to de-escalate the tense situation. Libya's political crisis can only be solved through negotiation between all stakeholders based on willingness to compromise and by putting the interests of Libyans first,"" an EU spokesman said.

The spokesperson pointed out that the United Nations remains the framework through which the international community continues to support Libya's political settlement. He confirmed EU's determination to continue supporting this process, including through the Libya Quartet with the United Nations as well as the African Union and the Arab League.

Sarraj had called on the international community to end the clashes in the south of the country, saying the sudden military escalation puts Libya on the brink of a civil war.

In the past few months, the LNA was able to liberate several areas after it lost control over two primary oil ports and then liberated them recently.

11403966,2017-04-13,"Tunis - Arab Envoy to Libya Salah Eddine Al-Jamali said that a solution to the crisis in Libya required dialogue and rebuilding trust between the different warring factions.

In remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper, al-Jamali blamed the ongoing crisis on warlords and militias seeking to achieve their own interests, as well as foreign powers looking to implement their agendas.

On the conflict between Speaker Aguila Saleh, Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and General Khalifa Haftar, the Arab envoy said that the problem was ""more superficial than substantial"".

""Rebuilding trust and holding dialogue is important now more than ever to successfully achieve the transitional period and move towards parliamentary and presidential elections,"" al-Jamali said.

Asked about the security in Tripoli, the Arab envoy described the situation as ""difficult"", noting that in wake of the absence of firm control by the army or police in the area, the prime minister established what is known as the presidential guards to maintain the safety of government buildings and embassies.

Al-Jamali urged the different political parties in Libya to sit around a dialogue table in order to rebuild trust between the country's leaderships.

""More efforts should be exerted in order to convince the parties to go back on their decision to reject dialogue,"" he stated.

He also underlined the difficult economic conditions in the African country, especially with regards to salaries and hospital services, due to the lack of financial liquidity.

On foreign interference, the Arab envoy said that a dialogue should be held between the Arab League, the European Union, the African Union and the United Nations to limit the influence of external meddling in the Libyan crisis.

11403967,2017-03-21,"Cairo - Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) and Head of United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Martin Kobler, warned of dangerous escalation across Libya emanating from the deteriorating security situation in Tripoli and events in Misrata and Benghazi.

This comes as the Prime Minister of the international-supported Government of National Accord Fayiz al-Sarraj began his visit to Italy. He partook in the Euro-Moroccan meeting to reach an agreement on a deal to block Libya's migrant smugglers.

""I call for all parties to put Libya and the unity of Libya ahead of their own narrow interests. Violence, hate speech, and mutilation of corpses in Libya is completely unacceptable. Calm must be restored immediately, democratic bodies and ideals must be respected and freedom of speech must be protected,"" said Kobler in his statement.

He urged the Libyan institutions to commit to advancing the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) and swiftly implement the security arrangements in Tripoli which provide for the withdrawal of armed groups from the capital and the deployment of army and police.

""Do not let the agenda be driven by violence on the ground and extremism,"" he added.

The Special Representative warned that the mobilization of forces and hostile acts and rhetoric present a real risk that will lead to widespread military confrontation.

""The responsibility, however, lies first and foremost with the Libyans themselves to end this escalating violence,"" stressed Kobler, adding that: ""All political and security stakeholders in a position to influence their constituencies should act now.""

Prior to his departure to Rome, Sarraj commented on the protests demanding the removal of militias from the capital and the creation of a unified police and security force, headed by Khalifa Haftar.

He said that that freedom of speech did not mean people could foster strife and division.

During a televised speech, Sarraj added that freedom of expression is integral and shooting on protestors is rejected, but he stressed this did not mean inciting hatred between cities was acceptable.

""17 February Revolution is the base for a new Libya,"" he stated.

In an implicit attack against Haftar's vow to ""liberate"" Tripoli and demand for all militias to leave the capital, Sarraj said that Libya could not return to being under the rule of one man. He also insisted that the armed forces should be unified and under civilian command.

Minister of Defense Al-Mahdi Al-Barghathi said that the military institution can't be reduced to one person and they can't allow the return to military ruling. He added that the ministry refuses to be led by a former defeated war captive who led the country to chaos and turmoil.

Sarraj began his visit to Rome on Monday along with the accompanying delegation and he informed AKI news agency that they will request several amendments to the deal signed with the government to ""remove any ambiguity that clarify its execution.""

Sarraj met with Italian counterpart Paolo Gentiloni who announced on Twitter that they discussed stability in Libya, reviving bilateral relations and cooperation in fighting illegal immigration.

Sarraj participated in the meeting of internal ministers from seven EU member states, Switzerland and Tunisia to set a plan to manage the migration flow through the Mediterranean.

The newly-established group included: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Libya, Malta, Slovenia, Switzerland and Tunisia who will work together to address challenges posed by increased migration flows along the central Mediterranean route.

The GNA demanded several equipment and vehicles worth 800 million to aid the boarder control unit, but a number of the tools required are halted due to UN's ban on transporting weapons to Libya.

Italy is determined to halt migrants from entering its shores through Libya, and migrant deaths at sea, set to outstrip last year's record total of 180,000.

Italian government promised to donate to Tripoli 200 million in aid from the EU to house refugees in camps on Libyan territories.

But, Libya will need the assistance of the UN agencies after they stated that the country was not safe for refugees.

Meanwhile, back in Libya, Sarraj's vice Ahmed Maiteeq met with UN Senior Advisor on security matters Paolo Serra security arrangements in Libya as well as demining Sirte and humanitarian aids from non-governmental organizations.

11403968,2017-02-28,"Cairo - Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj leading the internationally-backed government of national accord in Tripoli warned on agendas desperately working to reestablish a military dictatorship in Libya.

Serraj is scheduled to visit Russian capital, Moscow, later this week. The Libyan Prime Minister of the UN-backed government in Tripoli is scheduled to arrive in Moscow within days, Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Monday, citing Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov.

The visit is seen as a step towards overcoming a deadlock in the country between the Tripoli government and Khalifa Haftar, a military commander who is supported by factions based in the east of the oil-rich country.

Serraj, speaking before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said that it was critical to bolster efforts to stop armed groups and prevent human-trafficking gangs.

""This is a reason for grave concern"" he said, ""We have done our utmost to find a comprehensive political solution to end these violations. Serraj warned against the different efforts being spent on reinstating a dictatorship that reigns over Libya with gun power.

ISIS, the terror group which exercised heinous crimes against humanity, has been officially driven out of the city of Sirte, Serraj said. He added that displaced families have resumed returning to their homes.

Nonetheless, Serraj asked for greater funding from the ""states able to provide assistance"" to help his government carry out its policies.

More so, Serraj urged countries to provide assistance and information on assets accounted for in Libya so that they are tracked and recovered.

Cairo- Libya's Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj has unveiled the reasons behind the failure to hold a tripartite meeting that was set to take place in Cairo on Tuesday to resolve the Libyan political crisis.

""General Khalifa Haftar and Speaker of Tobruk-based House of Representatives Aqilah Saleh rejected to meet,"" Sarraj told Asharq Al-Awsat.

He said the dialogue will lead to solutions but the parties' stubbornness is hurdling talks, increasing the agony of Libyans.

Sarraj unveiled his willingness to announce a new roadmap within days but refused to give further details.

Egyptian officials met each party aside but no tripartite meeting was held, according to Sarraj, who showed appreciation to Egypt's efforts to resolve Libya's crisis.

Answering a question on the next government line-up, he replied: ""I don't mind to form the cabinet because the prime issue is amending the constitution that is still paralyzing the parliament. Parties should convene to agree on a roadmap that salvages Libya.""

Sarraj declared that forming a government amid ongoing disputes won't be of use as long as dialogue is being rejected.

Replying to a question on rumors of forming military and presidential councils, Sarraj said: ""This has never been suggested.""

The Libyan PM left Egypt on Tuesday without announcing whether a meeting with Haftar or tripartite talks were held.

In a related matter, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Abul Gheit met with Libyan deputy Prime Minister Ali al-Qatrani and member of presidential council Omar al-Aswad in an attempt to make progress in efforts to solve the Libyan crisis, and to urge political dialogue among rival parties.

Arab League spokesman Mahmoud Afifi stated that Abul Gheit underlined during the meeting the organization's commitment towards the Libyan people and Libya's sovereignty and independence.

11403970,2017-01-03,"Cairo - In yet another surprising move, deputy leader of Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) Musa al-Koni announced his resignation, after two ministers also resigned from the government headed by Fayiz al-Sarraj.

Koni, member of presidential council, held a press conference during which he announced his resignation and apologized to the Libyan people for the administration's failure to solve the problems in the country since its arrival in March last year.

Koni is the third of the presidential council chaired by Sarraj who resigns. Two other members resigned in protest for the attempts to remove Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar from position as leader of Libyan Army.

The Presidential Council is made up of nine members who are meant to represent different geographical regions and political currents within Libya.

""I announce my resignation due the failure of the Presidential Council, because it holds responsibility for the killing, kidnapping, and rape that happened over the past year,"" a visibly moved Koni said.

""I don't think we are unaware of what the citizens are suffering, but we are incapable, and I admit that we are failures because we didn't solve the problems, which are many,"" added Kouni, who represents the Tuareg minority in the GNA.

Koni declared that the GNA has accepted this mission and is responsible for what happens.

""We take responsibility for everything that has happened in the past year: violence, murder, rape, invasion, the squandering of public funds... Regardless of the extent of the crimes, we are responsible,"" he said.

""The inability to meet people's expectations leads me to resign... I pledged to alleviate their suffering but I did not succeed,"" Koni also wrote on his Twitter account.

Besides Koni's resignation, officials at Sarraj's office told Asharq Al-Awsat that Ministers of Interior and Planning, in the government not recognized by the parliament, also resigned from their positions.

Sarraj's government did not comment on the recent developments, but issued a short statement saying that the Presidential Council will continue to hold sessions, adding that the council will discuss with Koni his resignation.

These resignations cast doubt on the future of the government in its current form, just over a year after it was launched under a U.N.-mediated deal that had only partial support from Libya's rival factions.

Meanwhile, Libyan parliament held a session in Tobruk to question the government loyal to it and the regulatory bodies.

During their meeting in Cairo, Speaker Aguila Saleh informed Egyptian President Abdul Fattah Sisi last week that he would discuss with the MPs and all parties the political deal and the outcomes of the meetings held in Egypt between Libyan parties.

Saleh hoped the discussions would lead to suitable solutions for everyone in Libya and to the elimination of terrorism.

Since 2014, Libya had had two parliaments each with its own government and armed factions.

11403971,2017-01-02,"A deputy leader of Libya's Government of National Accord (GNA) announced his resignation on Monday, saying the U.N.-backed administration had failed to tackle urgent problems arising from years of conflict and political disarray.

The resignation of Musa al-Koni casts doubt on the future of the U.N.-backed government in its current form, just over a year after it was launched under a U.N.-mediated deal that had only partial support from Libya's rival factions.

Western powers backed the GNA to tackle terror group ISIS, boost Libya's oil production, and help stem the flow of sub-Saharan migrants from Libya to Europe.

But though ISIS has been ousted from its former stronghold of Sirte and oil production has recovered slightly, the GNA has largely failed to exert its authority over a country that slid into lawlessness after the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.

The GNA's leaders, including Koni, arrived in Tripoli in March, but have struggled to impose their authority. Militias still hold real power and living conditions have deteriorated.

""I announce my resignation due the failure of the Presidential Council, because it holds responsibility for the killing, kidnapping, and rape that happened over the past year,"" Koni told a press conference in Tripoli on Monday.

""I don't think we are unaware of what the citizens are suffering, but we are incapable, and I admit that we are failures because we didn't solve the problems, which are many.""

The GNA has been unable to win endorsement for a cabinet from a parliament based in the east of the country, where power-brokers have continued to back a rival government as armed forces allied to them and under the command of Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar have made military gains on the ground.

In Tripoli, the GNA has gradually taken control of some ministries, but it has been unable to improve security or deal with a liquidity crisis, steep inflation, and a collapse in public healthcare provision.

A self-declared government that the GNA displaced in the capital has recently tried to make a comeback.

The Presidential Council is made up of nine members who are meant to represent different geographical regions and political currents within Libya. Koni is one of three members from the south.

The Council has been bitterly divided, with two of its number mostly boycotting proceedings, and different members regularly issuing contradictory statements.

At the weekend, an eastern member of the Council, Fathi al-Majbari, announced a series of appointments during GNA Prime Minister Fayez Seraj's absence that were subsequently repudiated by another of the council's members.

Those who are waiting for the first signs of cooperation between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin should keep an eye on Libya. The scene of an open rivalry between the European Union and Russia could suddenly turn on Trump, who could turn to Putin.

Libya is important for three reasons. It's the starting point of the so-called Central Mediterranean route by which tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants reach the European Union . It's also a major oil producer that can affect global prices. Lastly, the chaos in Libya makes it, in the U.S. State department's terminology, ""a terrorist safe haven."" That's why presidents Obama and Trump have sought to limit the entry of Libyan citizens and those who have visited the country.

At an informal summit on Malta on Friday the leaders of European Union states affirmed their support for the UN-backed government, run from Tripoli by Prime Minister Fayez Mustafa al-Serraj. They also backed a deal Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni signed on Thursday with Serraj. Italy is taking the lead in funding the construction of refugee camps in Libya, and the EU as a whole recently earmarked an additional 200 million euros ($215 million) for its efforts to keep potential migrants in Libya, Tunisia and Niger.

But refugees are not Putin's priority in Libya. He's far more interested in restoring Russian influence there, and establishing a military presence if he can.

Under Muammar Qaddafi, Libya was a Russian ally, a playground for Russian energy companies, and a buyer of Russian weapons. When he fell in 2011, the Russian state railroad monopoly lost a lucrative contract to build a rail line along the Mediterranean coast, one of many voided Russian investments.

Putin watched the Arab Spring with dismay -- not just because it dispatched kleptocrats like himself, but also because those secular authoritarian rulers were often replaced with extremists. To Putin, these strongmen were a bulwark against jihadism. He drew a clear red line at Syrians' Western-backed attempt to overthrow Syrian Head of Regime Bashar al-Assad, forged a cordial relationship with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and restored ties with Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His alliance with Iran fits that line of behavior too.

In Libya, Putin's axis of secular authoritarians cannot include Serraj since he holds onto power with support from some extremist groups and Putin's Western adversaries. Khalifa Haftar, a powerful military commander who controls eastern Libya and resists the Serraj government, fits the bill much better.

Haftar chased extremist militants out of Benghazi and the surrounding area and took over Libya's key oil terminals from pro-government forces last September, boosting the country's output. The Kremlin has been cultivating a relationship with Haftar, inviting him for a visit to Moscow last November and then hosting him on the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in January, where he held a teleconference with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.

Russia is obliged to follow the UN arms embargo against any Libyan forces except the al-Serraj government, so it cannot provide official military aid to Haftar. There have been unconfirmed reports, however, that the Kremlin has struck an unofficial deal to supply Haftar via Algeria, a long-time Moscow arms client.

That's potentially scary for the EU. If a Putin ally takes over Libya, any deal on their primary issue -- refugees -- could be threatened. If Haftar allowed Russian military bases in Libya, Putin's strength in Middle East politics would continue to grow as well.

This sets the scene for a potential clash between the EU on one side and Putin and Trump on the other. There are major reasons for Trump to support Haftar over Serraj. Haftar spent 20 years in the U.S., living not far from the Central Intelligence Agency's Langley headquarters and working to undermine Qaddafi, his one-time friend and ally. Trump is also highly skeptical of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's actions in Libya as the Qaddafi regime disintegrated, and, like Putin, he doesn't believe in imposing democracy on Middle Eastern nations where extremist groups enjoy popular support.

Haftar and his supporters celebrated Trump's victory last November, seeing the new U.S. president as a potential ally against jihadists.

Moscow likely wouldn't mind testing the opportunities for cooperation with Trump in Libya. On Thursday, the state propaganda agency RIA Novosti published a column by Avigdor Eskin, an Israeli political consultant close to the Russian nationalist right, asserting that the Trump administration -- namely National Security Adviser Michael Flynn -- had a plan on Libya that might involve Russian cooperation via Haftar. The supposed plan involves building new ""micro-cities"" rather than refugee camps in Libya, with factories and oil facilities to put them to work.

Although that sounds like wishful thinking, the Kremlin is highly likely to approach the Trump administration with offers of pacifying Libya and thus weakening ISIS. The U.S. wouldn't even need to do anything except turn a blind eye to Russian support of Haftar. As in Syria, Putin's unique selling proposition is that he is not squeamish when it comes to dealing with strongmen and that, unlike any Western leader, he is unconstrained by the need to seek political support at home: He knows by now how to create it through a powerful propaganda machine.

If Trump's isolationist team is willing to cut its risks and outsource at least part of its promised fight against terrorism to Russia, an understanding on Libya is a possible first step down that road.

11404096,2017-08-28,"Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir at a joint press conference with Libya's unity government chief in Khartoum on August 27, 2017 (AFP)

Khartoum- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and the head of Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez al-Sarraj, agreed to cooperate on security issues, in particular fighting terrorism in order to restore Libya's stability.

In a joint news conference with Sarraj in Khartoum, Bashir said his country had no agendas in Libya except to achieve unity and stability and restore security.

""We confirm that we do not have a special agenda that is not in the interests of the Libyan people,"" he said.

Bashir stressed that his government's support for the revolution against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 was based on the desire to achieve the aspirations of the Libyan people and to consolidate security and stability in the country and the region.

""Unfortunately, things went against what we wanted, and we confirm that we have maintained our efforts to support the Libyan people and the country's security,"" he said.

He noted that some Sudanese members of rebel groups were active in Libya as mercenaries, stressing that they represented a real threat to Sudan.

""We are affected directly by the insecurity in Libya, which has made it expensive for us to fight human trafficking, illegal immigration and cross-border crimes,"" Bashir said.

""Those who are committing these crimes are using the instability in Libya, and using Sudanese territories to commit their crimes,"" he added.

For his part, Sarraj told reporters that he discussed with Bashir challenges facing the two countries, latest developments in Libya on the political, economic and security levels, and efforts to achieve national reconciliation and end divisions.

He added that talks have also touched on the means to secure common borders, the implementation of security agreements, the development of bilateral relations and the exchange of support in the economic fields, as well as the promotion of investment.

Sarraj arrived in the Sudanese capital on Monday on a two-day official visit, after a previous trip to the country was postponed in mid-March due to security unrest in Libya.

Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour told reporters at Khartoum airport that the official visit would tackle bilateral relations, Sudanese armed movements active in Libya, economic issues and coordination on regional and international levels.

11404098,2017-06-05,"Cairo - Sudan's Foreign Affairs Minister Ibrahim Ghandour underlined the ""very special and strategic ties"" with Egypt, despite some tensions that surfaced lately between the two countries.

In an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper in Cairo on Sunday, Ghandour said that the two African states have agreed to resolve any issues that could threaten bilateral relations, stressing that no country ""could use the Sudanese territories to harm Egypt or even Libya.""

The Sudanese official noted that during his recent meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, an agreement was reached on the need to maintain constant communication between the two countries' various institutions, in order to overcome any misunderstanding.

Asked whether a third party was trying to spark tensions between Sudan and Egypt, Ghandour said: ""All over the world, there are hidden parties that do not wish to see stable relations between countries.""

""There is certainly someone who is seeking to instigate conflicts, but I came here to say that the relations between our two states are sacred and we should avoid distorting them,"" he added.

On whether Qatar was using Sudan to harm Egypt, the Sudanese foreign minister said: ""I read such claims in the Egyptian media; but in reality this is not true.""

""Sudan's relations with Egypt do not make room for any interference,"" he noted, adding: ""We cannot allow any party to push us to harm Egypt's interests, safety or stability.""

Ghandour said that talks during his meetings have focused on security cooperation in light of the attack on African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.

He noted that his country was keen on the formation of joint border security forces between Egypt, Sudan and Libya to promote security along the borders and counter the infiltration of terrorist groups.

He highlighted in this regard Sudan's ""successful experience with Chad"", adding that his country would also implement this security strategy with Ethiopia.

On Libya, Ghandour said it was obvious that Egypt supports Army Commander Khalifa Haftar, while Sudan is cooperating with the UN-backed national unity government.

""Consequently, we have agreed with our brothers in Egypt that the Libyan crisis should be resolved by the Libyan people themselves and that there was no alternative for an intra-Libyan dialogue to resolve the current problems,"" he stated.

Asked about relations with South Sudan, Ghandour said that the two states were holding regular meetings under the umbrella of the African Union to address security and defense matters.

The foreign minister stressed the need to end the war and achieve peace in South Sudan.

""We are ready to cooperate on all levels,"" he stated.

He also announced that a meeting for the Libyan rival parties would be held in the Guinean capital to agree on a government of national unity.

Conde arrived on Sunday in Khartoum on a three-day visit to discuss the security situation in the continent.

The official news agency SUNA Sunday quoted Sudan's foreign minister Ibrahim Ghandour as saying ""Conde's visit to the country comes upon an official invitation from President Omar al-Bashir"".

During a news conference following a bilateral meeting with the Sudanese president, Conde said he would work to achieve the full lifting of US sanctions against Sudan, in order to facilitate the movement of Bashir within the African continent and the world.

""We came here to tell the world that we stand by this people and this country,"" the AU chairperson stated.

On Libya, Conde blamed the international community for the security instability in the African country, stressing that foreign intervention in the Libyan crisis has further escalated the crisis there.

He noted in this regard that Guinea would host a meeting between the different Libyan factions to agree on a national unity government, with the hope to end the conflict.

Conde also called on Sudan to support the AU plans, which aim to reach a political solution to end the political stalemate in Libya.

The Sudanese president, for his part, said he discussed with his Guinean counterpart bilateral relations and the latest developments in Sudan, on the political, security and economic levels.

He added that discussions also touched on regional developments, highlighting the AU chairman's efforts to support Sudan and the African continent.

11404310,2017-07-19,"Geneva, Tunis - The United Nations called on Tuesday the Libyan National Army (LNA) to investigate executions without trial against a number of detainees.

The LNA, which controls the eastern part of the North African country, is seeking to expand its presence in the area and is competing for power with forces affiliated with the UN-backed Libyan government and other opponents.

LNA leader Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar has gained ground with Egyptian and Emirati support, and Western states say Haftar must be part of any solution to Libya's conflict

UN human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell said: ""We are deeply concerned that, after recent fighting in Benghazi, people taken prisoner by members of the LNA, which effectively controls eastern Libya, may be at imminent risk of torture and even summary execution.""

The LNA announced last March that it would conduct investigations into alleged war crimes but has not shared any information, Throssell told a news briefing.

""We urge the LNA to ensure there is a full, impartial investigation into these allegations,"" she said.

Reports have suggested the involvement of Special Forces, a unit aligned with the LNA, ""in torturing detainees and summarily executing at least 10 captured men"", she said.

Throssell also called on the group to suspend Mahmoud al-Werfalli from his duties as a Special Forces field commander pending the conclusion of such an investigation.

A video circulating on social media in March allegedly showed al-Werfalli shooting dead three men who were kneeling and facing a wall with their hands tied behind their backs, Throssell said.

In June, two further videos appeared to show summary executions carried out by LNA fighters on his orders.

""One of these videos, which emerged on 9 June, shows four men kneeling with their hands tied behind their backs who are shot dead as al-Werfalli watches,"" she said.

""The latest video, which was posted on social media this month, seems to shows LNA fighters kicking and taunting prisoners, while al-Werfalli is apparently heard accusing two men who have their hands tied behind their backs of belonging to terrorist groups,"" she said.

The LNA has declined comment on the images.

Meanwhile, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi held telephone talks with Haftar on Tuesday as part of efforts to push the political process forward in Libya.

On Wednesday, the foreign ministers of China and Tunisia called for new efforts to reach a negotiated peace in Libya and prevent the unstable North African nation from dissolving into a humanitarian disaster on a level with Syria.

China's Wang Yi said Libya is attracting militants from across the globe now being driven from Iraq and Syria, requiring the international community to step in and prevent the country becoming ""a new source of international terrorism.""

""We should prevent Libya from becoming the next Syria,"" Wang told reporters in Beijing.

Tunisia's Khemaies Jhinaoui, whose country borders Libya, said a political rather than military solution is needed based on a 2015 UN-brokered peace deal.

""Libya should realize its security, independence and territorial integrity and avoid the misfortune of national disruption,"" Jhinaoui said.

The International Criminal Court chief's prosecutor Wednesday called for the ""immediate arrest and surrender"" of Moamer Gaddafi's son Seif al-Islam, who was reportedly set free by a militia in Libya.

Seif al-Islam, the second son and heir apparent of the late deposed Libyan dictator, was said to have been released on Friday by a militia that controls the town of Zintan in western Libya.

An arrest warrant issued by the Hague-based ICC against Seif in 2011 ""remains valid and Libya is obliged to immediately arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi... regardless of any purported amnesty law in Libya,"" Fatou Bensouda said.

But the prosecutor general's office in Tripoli, where a rival UN-backed administration is based, said the amnesty could not apply to Seif al-Islam because of the severity of his crimes, saying he was still wanted for a 2015 conviction.

Bensouda said the world war crimes court is now ""verifying"" Seif al-Islam's whereabouts.

She called on Libya, the UN Security Council and ""all other relevant"" countries ""to provide my office with any relevant information in their possession.""

The ICC also called for the arrest and surrender of Libya's former security chief Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled, who is wanted on similar charges as Seif for his role in attempting to quash the 2011 revolt against slain strongman Gaddafi.

The ICC in April unveiled an arrest warrant for Khaled.

""It is imperative for both suspects to be apprehended and immediately surrendered to the custody of the ICC so that their guilt or innocence can be established...for justice to be done, and seen to be done,"" Bensouda said.

11404312,2017-05-11,"Cairo - Libya has recaptured its momentum in the oil market after its oil and gas production has exceeded one million barrels per day. OPEC's member states are worried that Libyan gains could undermine the organization's efforts in reducing the global oil supply.

Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corporation, has doubted Libya's capacity to produce one million oil barrels per day by August. However, others see this massive production can be easily maintained in line with the ongoing developments in the country. The total production of crude oil and gas in Libya exceeded 800,000 barrels of crude oil and 250,000 barrels of gas per day.

Libyan businessman Husni Bey told Asharq Al-Awsat that the production of crude oil -without gas- in Libya can exceed one million barrels within three months in case the National Oil Corporation provides the needed budgets. He added that the total production's revenues and sales show that production of both oil and gas has already exceeded the million barrels.

El Sharara and the Elephant fields, which resumed their activity after suspension, contribute in increasing Libya's production of crude oil to over 800,000 barrels per day, which is the highest record since 2014. Production during this week augmented by 30,000 barrels compared to the last one.

Both fields, with a capacity production of over 360,000 barrels daily, resumed their work in the end of April after being suspended due to protests. Al-Baida field in eastern Libya also resumed work after a four-year suspension.

Currently, it pumps 10,000 barrels per day, said a spokesman to the Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO). Omran al-Zwai, AGOCO's spokesman said that before the suspension caused by the bad security conditions, the embargo imposed over the imports, and the damaged infrastructure, Al-Baida field's production reached 14,000 barrels per day. He added that 60,000 barrels produced and currently preserved in Al-Baida field are expected to be exported. Zwai said that AGOCO exports oil through the ports of Al Hariga and Zuwetina.

OPEC and non-member producers have pledged to reduce the production by around 1.8 barrels per day, to curb the global offer. However, Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the organization's reduction agreement.

For his part, Kamel Abdullah, expert in the Libyan issue from Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies doubted Libya's capacity in increasing the production and maintaining the current levels amid the state of discord and chaos that dominates the country. He asserted that the production will not increase and will not reach one million barrels.

Abdullah told Asharq Al-Awsat: ""The National Oil Corporation, Khalifa Haftar - the Libyan national army leader (LNA) - the Libyan presidency, and the different entities in the country do not have a real influence over the militants who are controlling the crude oil transportation lines. He expected the work oil fields to stop again amid the chaos and the political deadlock. The expert suggested that this fact was acknowledged by OPEC from the beginning, therefore, the organization exempted Libya from the agreement.

Oil comes in line with a partial improvement in the Libyan economy, following the deal inked with the French Bank Societe General who paid the Libyan administration over $1.1 billion aiming to avoid an expensive judicial procedure over a long conflict the bank faced with the Libyan Investment Authority.

The second biggest bank in France reached Thursday a settlement concerning allegations launched by the Libyan Investment Authority to accuse Societe General of corruption and deceitful acts.

Last summer, however, the Libyan Fund lost a lawsuit against The Goldman Sachs Group. The fund sought to bag of $1.2 billion from the American Company regarding nine investments proceeded in 2008.

On another hand, Libya prepares for the return of Russian companies soon, following statements by the Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov during a meeting with Fayez Mustafa al-Sarraj, chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya and prime minister of the Government of National Accord in Tripoli on April 25.

If Libya insisted on increasing its oil production or maintained it, it will contribute in the pressures over oil prices. The list of factors triggering this pressure includes: slow demand, increased production of Shale oil, and increased offer.

These growing pressures will destabilize the client's trust in OPEC's capacity in re-securing the market's stability. In this case, OPEC may reconsider its decision on exempting Libya from the agreement.

11404327,2017-09-28,"Tunis - Cairo - The two delegations to the Libyan political dialogue, which is hosted by Tunisia under the supervision of UN Envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame, discussed on Wednesday the structure of the executive authority and its powers, within a plan to amend the Skhirat political agreement.

The closed meeting gathered a delegation representing the Libyan Parliament and another representing the High Council of the State.

Dialogue sessions between the Libyan factions will be held until next Monday to allow the opportunity to listen to as many Libyan political leaders as possible.

Libyan political officials and tribal leaders continued to arrive in the Tunisian capital on Wednesday, to participate in the dialogue sessions, which bring together representatives of the Libyan parliament and the Council of State and which are aimed at amending the political agreement signed between the Libyan parties in the Moroccan city of Skhirat in 2015, under the auspices of the United Nations mission in Libya.

Well-informed Libyan sources told Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that the coming meetings would be reserved for the political leaders representing the dialogue committees, away from the media.

Intra-Libyan sessions would be followed by brief evening speeches, either by a Libyan representative or by the UN envoy.

Contrary to expectations, Wednesday's round of talks did not tackle the issue of deleting Article 8 of the political agreement, which specifies the powers of the supreme commander of the Libyan armed forces.

Sultana al-Mesmari, member of Parliament's delegation, said that the committee charged with amending the Skhirat agreement focused on discussing the powers and work mechanism of Libya's Presidential Council.

She added that the meetings did not address Article 8 of the political agreement, ""but was focused on issues that bear a higher degree of consensus"", noting: ""Article 8 and the Supreme Commander's authorities constitute the real point of disagreement.""

Meanwhile, the commander of the Libyan Armed Forces, Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar, concluded his visit to Italy following a series of talks with a number of Italian political and security officials.

The visit resulted mainly in Italy's call for Haftar to disarm and abandon military action against the UN-backed government, and to participate in the country's political process.

Local sources said that Haftar ""received an unambiguous message"" during his meeting with Italian officials that he ""must confront his political opponents and abandon military moves against the presidential council of the National Reconciliation Government headed by Fayez al-Sarraj in Tripoli"".

Cairo- London hosted a meeting on Thursday to support the political process in Libya and back the efforts of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and his special envoy Ghassan Salame.

The British Foreign Office said in a statement that the six-nation ministerial meeting represented an opportunity to discuss ways to break Libya's political stalemate and build momentum in support of the efforts of the Secretary-General and his special representative.

The foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the United Nations envoy to Libya attended the meeting.

""Libya is a front line in our common struggle against terrorism and illegal migration and we all share a vital interest in that country's stability. Our shared goal is to break the political deadlock and rally behind the United Nations envoy Ghassan Salame as he seeks to bring all sides together,"" British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said during a joint news conference with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

The Italian foreign ministry said in a statement that the London meeting discussed the status of the political process in Libya and exchanged views on how to support the work of the United Nations in light of the meeting to be convened by the UN Secretary-General on the sidelines of the General Assembly in New York next week.

Meanwhile, the UN Security Council extended on Thursday for one year the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), focused on supporting the North African country's political process and key national institutions, as well as coordination of international assistance.

In a statement, the UN News Center said that the Security Council has unanimously adopted a new resolution, extending UNSMIL's mandate through 15 September 2018, ""during which time it would exercise mediation and 'good offices' to support an inclusive political process within the framework of the Libyan Political Agreement; continued implementation of the Agreement; and consolidation of the governance, security and economic arrangements of the Government of National Accord (GNA), among others.""

Tillerson and British Prime Minister Theresa May touched on the Libyan crisis during their meeting in London on Thursday.

""We hope to focus on the mediation of the United Nations and the political process and give them a new impetus to reach a reunification in Libya,"" a US official said.

On a different note, the International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda renewed her calls to the Libyan government on Wednesday for the immediate arrest and surrender of Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf al-Werfalli, who is alleged to have participated in war crimes in Libya.

Werfalli is suspected of directly participating in seven incidents involving the deaths of 33 individuals.

Stressing that Libya has the primary responsibility to arrest Werfalli and surrender him to the custody of the ICC, Bensouda urged Libya authorities to ""use all means in their reach to do so immediately.""

She also expressed concerns regarding conflicting reports about the arrest of the Libyan figure.

11404330,2017-08-24,"Cairo- The latest rights report issued in Libya accused Qatar of sponsoring terrorism. The report, which was prepared by the Cairo-based Libya Justice First Foundation, said that it uses all its resources, including reports and information on Libyan entities and individuals on the list of Arab States, to be used by relevant counter-terrorism bodies.

The foundation called on the whole world to cooperate with the Arab quartet, which has issued two lists during the past two months on the terrorist individuals and entities related to Qatar; including seven Libyan individuals and seven Libyan organizations.

The Arab quartet, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain, released early June a long list of 59 individuals and 12 Qatari-affiliated entities described as ""terrorist supporters.""

The list included five Libyans, Ali al-Sallabi, Abd Al-Hakim Belhaj, Mahdi al-Harati, Ismail al-Sallabi and Sadiq al-Ghariyani in addition to Benghazi Defense Brigades terrorist organization.

The four Arab countries released late July another terror list in which they added nine entities and nine individuals.

The second list included Ibrahim Bukhazem and Ahmed al-Hasnawi in addition to six Libyan entities, which are Al-Saraya Media Center, Boshra News Agency, Rafallah Sahati Brigade, Nabaa TV, Tanasuh Foundation for Dawa, Culture and Media and Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council.

For his part, Head of the Justice First Foundation Hassan Tatanaki told Asharq Al-Awsat that the war against terrorism is ""not only military and security but also legal, intelligence, economic and intellectual wars.""

In regards to the Nabaa TV, the report said that the channel has appeared four years ago ""in a way that is almost identical to the Qatari Al Jazeera channel, especially in its editorial policy.""

The report added that ""the observers of the channel will easily discover that it promotes the ideology of the Libyan militant groups and extremist ideas.

11404332,2017-06-12,"Cairo- Two days after his release from the town of Zintan under an amnesty law passed by a parliament based in eastern Libya, Seif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, is now free to practice any aspect of his life, the Libyan National Army led by military commander Khalifa Haftar confirmed on Sunday.

However, Gaddafi's new whereabouts are still unknown.

Seif had been held in Zintan, about 170 kilometers southwest of Tripoli, since November 2011.

Tribal sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that contacts have been made with leaderships in central and western Libya to have more information on the matter.

In 2015, a court in Tripoli, where extremist and militia forces rule, sentenced Saif to death in absentia for war crimes.

Zintan's Abu Baker Sadiq brigade, led by Commander Ajmi al-Atir, who is close to Haftar, announced on Sunday it has chosen to release Saif.

Ahmed al-Mismari, a spokesman for the Libyan National Army, asserted that Seif Gaddafi is now free in line with the amnesty law.

""He is outside Zintan city now and he can take part in any political process if there are no legal hindrances to it,"" al-Mismari said.

Gaddafi's loyalists in the east of the country, where Haftar is building power, have been pushing for Saif's release.

However, sources close to Libya's presidential council of the Government of National Accord led by Fayez al-Sarraj, said that members of the council and other militia leaderships in Tripoli and Misrata, reject the decision of freeing the son of Muammar Gaddafi.

Meanwhile, it remains unclear what role Seif al-Islam would play in Libya, where several armed groups and three governments rule the country.

While still under arrest, Seif established last year the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya, which includes some loyalists of his father and other figures who sympathize with him.

11404333,2017-06-10,"Cairo, Aden, Riyadh, Ramallah, Beirut, London - Qatar has come under the spotlight in the past week over its role in backing terrorist and extremist factions across the Arab world such as al-Nusra Front, the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas Movement and the Libyan Fighting Group.

The support for such groups was accompanied with Doha's development of ties with both Israel and Iran.

Open and Secret Violations

In the statement that Saudi Arabia issued after cutting ties with Qatar, Riyadh spoke of ""grave, open and secret violations committed by the authorities in Doha for years. These violations have aimed at dividing the Saudi internal scene and encouraged attempts to undermine its sovereignty.""

It accused Qatar of harboring several terrorist and sectarian groups that seek to target stability in the region. These organizations include the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS and al-Qaeda.

It has also supported the Iran-backed terrorist groups active in al-Qatif province in Saudi Arabia and others in Bahrain, the statement said.

The terrorist groups in Qatif have an Iranian agenda aimed at creating strife and attacking state institutions and police.

Inflaming the Situation in Yemen

The developments in Yemen in the past three years revealed that Qatar played a huge role in stirring internal conflicts under different slogans.

Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood (The Yemeni Congregation for Reform party) and Houthi insurgents under the pretext that it was mediating to stop the conflict, observers said.

Mediator in Lebanon

In Lebanon and during the 2006 war, Qatar mediated between Lebanon and Israel to reach a ceasefire. ""Hezbollah"" welcomed the role of Qatar after it promised financial support to rebuild towns and villages destroyed by Israeli warplanes.

This allowed Doha to become a player in internal disputes. It hosted the Doha conference which followed Hezbollah's military attacks in Beirut and Mount Lebanon in May 2008.

The Doha Agreement ended the country's 18-month crisis and led to the election of Michel Suleiman as a consensual presidential candidate.

Double Standards in Syria

Despite political differences on Syria, Doha hasn't lost its indirect mediation role between ""Hezbollah"" or the Syrian regime on one side and extremist opposition groups or terrorist organizations on the other.

One of such roles was Qatar's mediation in the release of Lebanese pilgrims abducted in Aazaz in northwest Syria in 2013 in return for setting free dozens of prisoners from Syrian jails and two Turkish pilots kidnapped in Lebanon.

It played a similar role in setting free nuns taken hostage by al-Nusra Front in Maaloula near Damascus and the release of Lebanese servicemen taken hostage by the same group following an incursion to the Lebanese border town of Arsal in 2014.

Sowing Division among Palestinians

Qatar has never stopped its attempts to weaken Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority by backing financially the Hamas movement which took over the Gaza Strip in 2007 and by resorting to tarnishing the image of the PA through the Doha-funded Al Jazeera channel.

The Qatari and Iranian support helped Hamas impose its hegemony on Gaza and confront the PA, which led to huge inter-Palestinian divisions that harmed the Palestinian cause.

In 2009, Qatar invited Hamas leader to an Arab summit, a move that sought to de-legitimize Abbas.

Al Jazeera had its share in distorting Abbas' image when in 2001 it broadcast official documents on meetings held between the PA and Israel in which it accused the authority of ""coordinating with Israel to kill Palestinians.""

Qatar's targeting of Abbas reached its climax when the former emir visited the Gaza Strip in 2012, ignoring the Palestinian leader and dealing with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.

Egypt's Suffering Continues

Egypt has in the past years witnessed many terrorist attacks in the Sinai Peninsula and other cities. Hundreds of officials, civilians, soldiers and policemen have been killed since the military overthrew Qatar-backed president Mohammed Morsi in 2013.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has lately accused countries, which he did not name, of sponsoring terrorism and taking advantage of the chaos in Libya to send extremists across the border.

Adel al-Amdah, an advisor at the Nasser Higher Military Academy (NHMA) in Cairo, told Asharq Al-Awsat that Egypt's decision to cut its relations with Qatar came at the right time.

Asked if there was any evidence on Doha's involvement in violence and in backing extremists in Egypt, Amdah said: ""Of course ... Had Cairo and the Arab League not been sure of such information, they wouldn't have cut ties with it.""

""There has been clear evidence on the involvement of terrorist groups backed by Qatar in acts in several Arab countries, including Egypt,"" he said.

Threatening the Libyan State

As for Libya, Dr. Mohammed al-Zubaidi, the former head of the legal committee of the Libyan tribes conference, said that Qatar's role in Libya, including its military and financial support for extremists, ruined all chances to establish a state.

Zubaidi also said that Doha-backed media outlets stirred strife in Libya by reporting fake news and falsifying facts.

While the Arab world was busy confronting the so-called Arab Spring, Qatar took advantage of the situation and passed many resolutions against Libya, including the suspension of its Arab League membership, and a request by the League from the UN Security Council for international intervention, which ultimately led to NATO's meddling and the destruction of institutions, he said.

Zubaidi said Doha destroyed Libya's social fabric by buying off Libyan tribes, which caused disputes among different tribes, the effects of which remain to this day.

He added that Qatar backed certain militias by providing them with money and weapons. ""This led to instability and had negative effects on neighboring countries.""

11404334,2017-05-31,"Casablanca- As the popular uprising which toppled the regime of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi unfolded, both Nabil Al-Khatib and Fares bin Hazam asked me to return to Tunisia where I stayed a few January weeks as a member of Al Arabia news team.

At the time, we were covering the revolution which marked the end of Zine El Abidine's 23-year-long presidency.

I was tasked with covering the humanitarian aspect of the Libyan incident; the refugee crisis taking place on Libya-Tunisia borders and on the airbridge of Djerba Island, South of Tunisia, where refugees were being deported to their countries.

Increasingly, I had to embark on a perilous journey through rugged desert routes in Libya with a group of Amazigh rebels who expelled Gaddafi authorities from their city of Nalut and raised the flag of independence for the first time since the coup against the constitutional monarchy in September of 1969.

Since February 2011, I have frequently visited Libya as I spent several months traveling between Zintan, Tripoli, Benghazi and Tobruk, until the day militant groups targeting journalists took control of swathes of Libyan land.

The day after the revolutionaries broke through Tripoli and upon declaring the political and armed opposition by the transitional council in Benghazi which was also called ""Comprehensive Liberation"" and ""Ultimate Victory"" Dr. Mahmoud Jibril, head of the Executive Office (in the mini-transitional government), proposed a plan to disarm unlisted fighters in hundreds of battalions and draft thousands of combatants into the Libyan National Army.

However, Qatari officials rejected the plan and warned against the prospect of disarming rebels. The former Emir of Qatar voiced a similar position at a Paris presser.

Everyone was aware of the threat found in the proliferation of arms and tens of thousands of extrajudicial fighters in the most populous cities, but no one in that early period of post-Gaddafi Libya could have stood up to what Qatari intelligence officers were drawing up in Tripoli hotel suites.

""Qatari officers directed leaders of the armed groups participating in the battle of 'Fateh Tarablos' (Arabic for liberating Tripoli) to target places like the Central Bank and Bab al-Azizia, arms and ammunition stores and intelligence offices,"" a Libyan politician said when recalling the string of events related to the militant revolution.

Overrunning such institutions and sites was the first step in fundamentalist militias trodding into Libya and weakening the Libyan national army. Militias quickly seized control of funding and arming sources as the Qatari media promoted LIFG member Abdelhakim Belhadj as the de facto ruler of the capital.

The public street was overwhelmed with emotion- kindness and gratitude were expressed to Qatar, which presented itself at the scene with vital powers, money and propaganda. All had only saw Qatar's investment as to help Libya break free from Gaddafi's iron fist.

It was a while before the Libyans realized that what Qatar had done was not entirely innocent, but served certain interests.

Actually, Mahmoud Jibril met a better fate than that of Liberation Army leader and the late Interior Minister Major General Abdelfattah Younis.

I moved to eastern Libya to pursue diplomatic and political developments in Benghazi, which became the de facto capital, receiving international leaders and delegations from around the world. Furthermore, I kept a close eye on eastern battlefronts and the advances made by opposition forces towards Sirte and the capital Tripoli in the west.

A limited distance separated the forces of Gaddafi, midway between Ajdabiya and Brega. And from time to time some skirmishes occurred, but the stalemate on the front continued for weeks and began to spread frustration and poor morale among the rebel fighters, particularly as Ramadan (Islam's holy month of fasting) closed in accompanied with high temperatures.

Younis had to move swiftly so that the Gaddafi battalions would not return to pose a threat to Ajdabiya and Benghazi while they were on the defensive to repel armed opposition attacks and attempt to break into Brega.

Younis, during his meetings in Rome with NATO military officials and some of the committees of Friends of Libya, proposed a plan to break this impasse, taking into consideration the concerns that were being fueled by intelligence reports and warnings against continuing to arm Gaddafi fighters. Younis presented a plan that would provide access to more supplies of weapons and ammunition and explain how the armed battalions would prevent access to medium equipment and heavy military equipment, so that cooperation in exchanging information with professional military dissidents would remain only for the benefit of extremist groups.

Qatar shared details of the plan with prominent Islamic leaders in eastern Libya, including Ismail al-Salabi, commander of the February 17 battalion, Mohammed al-Zahawi, Ziad Balam, al-Sharkasi and Usama bin Humaid, because they were deprived from arms and ammunition.

And without them, there would have been no long-standing fighters in the Gaddafi jails and in mountain pockets in Pakistan and Afghanistan and such untrained fighters won't have any room in the future of Libya.

Younis was besieged in the main operations room near the Ajdabiya gates, which included 100 vehicles with Grad rocket launchers, and was forced to leave under the pretext of summoning him for judicial investigation. In a camp affiliated with Al-Qaeda terrorist organization, he was executed with bullets and his body burned before being thrown into a forest nearby Benghazi.

In the aftermath of Qatar's intervention, a strong national army capable of dealing with imminent threats, especially the spread of arms and militias, and securing the elections for a future democracy which could have succeeded in restoring stability were made near impossible.

A militia-free Libya, bolstered by an elected government would have ushered in a new phase for the oil-rich country, opening its doors to two major energy markets, Europe and Africa.

Libya gradually slipped into bloody chaos after the relative stability that followed the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime. It is true that voters did not shy away from the polls in the 2012 elections and turnout favored national and progressive forces. Fundamentalists gained less than one-third of the votes. Despite their progress in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, they managed to impose their will at the ballot box. However, this 'will' remains within polling stations surrounded by fundamentalist armed militias. Qatari support for political Islam that opposed most progressive projects in Libya, was made clear through the media and other resources.

However, all this gave the National Party, founded by Abdul Hakim Belhadj, one of the founders of the LIFG or the Justice and Construction Party, the Brotherhood branch in Libya, nothing but a limited number of seats in the NCP.

The rest of the story is clear- the power of money and weapons was exploited to build parliament alliances that prevent the majority from forming a government.

During the 2012 elections, I was in Benghazi. Observers noticed how the city voted heavily for the National Forces Alliance and how revenge was exacted on Benghazi after it disappointed the Brotherhood and Takfiris by focusing their military arms activities on them and turning them into a bloody ""jihad"" arena for establishing a religious emirate on the southern bank of the average.

Ansar al-Sharia, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Libya Shield Force united in Benghazi to confront operation Karama (Arabic for dignity) led by Marshal Khalifa Hafter. This melting pot of terrorists consists of a familiar and famous conspiracy that later was supported by Qatar media as ""Benghazi rebels.""

Despite this support, the establishment of a fundamentalist government and the establishment of offshore companies to manage Libya's oil and gas and massive Libyan assets abroad failed. The pace of Somaliland accelerated until it became a failed state. As Berga tribes fought to expel spies and bloodthirsty murderers from Benghazi, they also welcomed legitimate institutions of the country and provided them with protection.

Qatari support has been a means of pressure on the governments of former Libyan prime ministers Abdurrahim El-Keib and Ali Zidane. It resulted in militias earning hundreds of millions of dollars of Libyan oil revenues and the formation of armor forces and councils of the Shura in Benghazi and Derna and Ajdabiya and then extending their control over the Crescent oil area and all the locations where oil and gas reserves exist.

In light of an expanding ISIS in Libya, and the influx of tens of thousands of illegal African migrants, it was up to the international community to prevent the establishment of a self-proclaimed Islamic 'caliphate' on the southern bank of the Mediterranean.

Civil strife in Tripoli, Benghazi and the south dragged for a long time. International forces should have stepped in to ward off risks of Libya's troubles stepping beyond its borders and into neighboring countries. The UN has called for a peace in which all sides to the conflict should partake.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco supported the efforts of the United Nations envoy.

Prince Mansour bin Nasser, advisor to the late Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, and Yasin al-Mansouri, adviser to Morocco's King Mohammed VI played a major role in the preparations for landmark Libyan negotiations in the resort of Skhirat near Rabat, which lasted for nearly a year.

Nevertheless, negotiations were mostly swayed to the advantage of Islamists and fundamentalists -supported by Qatar- being placed in high-profile posts controlling defense, security, and public assets in Libya.

Eventually, international and regional pressure pushed parties to sign a peace agreement and form a presidential council and a national unity government that runs the country, but this cabinet has so far been unable to assert its control over the capital it shares with a parallel government backed by Qatar.

Having a different approach, Saudi Arabia behaves as a government interacting with institutions through embassies and diplomatic missions to international and regional organizations, remaining at a distance from the Libyan conflict, even before Gaddafi was toppled.

On the other hand, the UAE sought to overcome obstacles inhibiting the Skhirat political agreement through holding a meeting between Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, President of the internationally-recognized Presidential Council Fayez Al-Sarraj, with Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the army commander appointed by the recognized and elected parliament.

Success of UAE diplomacy in Libya is measured by the United Nations and major powers adopting a draft agreement that wisely contributed to dismantling the political Islam system in the capital Tripoli, the west and the center of the country, and to some extent the south.

With the Sarraj-Haftar agreement in Abu Dhabi isolating Islamists who filled positions in the government of reconciliation striving only after financial benefits, Qatar loses its case a little more each day in Libya, especially as the US Trump administration warned Doha on its plot to continue fueling the conflict through supporting extremist organizations that do not believe in democratic rules and the peaceful transfer of power.

More so, the policy of division and chaos and the confusion Qatar drew up has not yet been able to infect neighboring countries such as Egypt, which remains a strong national state.

Undermining Egypt's national security and occupying the region with meaningless chaos has proved a failed quest.

11404335,2017-05-29,"Cairo - While Egypt continued its air assaults in Libya for the third consecutive day on Sunday, Egyptian army spokesman Tamer al-Rifai told Asharq Al-Awsat that the wave of strikes against terrorists attacking Egypt were successful.

Al-Rifai revealed that those attacks were not restricted to the coastal town of Derna, but they were directed at any place where terrorists are trained to shake Egypt's stability.

""The Egyptian air strikes target all camps where terrorist members are being trained and which could threaten Egypt's national security,"" al-Rifai said.

Egypt carried out the airstrikes on Derna last Friday following the shooting of Coptic Christians in Minya in Upper Egypt, which resulted in the death of 29 civilians.

Asked whether Egypt could possibility participate in a ground invasion against the extremist bases inside Libya, a military source told Asharq Al-Awsat by telephone: ""If the armed forces decide to conduct any air, ground or naval operation, they would not announce it.""

Other military sources said that the attacks launched against terrorist bases in Derna had reached extremist camps in the Jabal al-Akhdar (Green Mountain), adding that in the past few months, the army had traced the transfer of extremist forces from Sirte and Tripoli to areas in the east of Libya, near the borders with Egypt.

While the Libya Council had condemned the attack on Egypt's Copts, it nevertheless denounced Cairo's decision to attack Derna.

Meanwhile, a Russian-Egyptian meeting in Cairo is expected on Monday to discuss issues related to terrorism and the Libyan crisis.

Separately, former Libyan Youth and Sports Minister Mustafa al-Darssi launched fresh accusations against Qatar for supporting extremist groups in Libya, by telling Asharq Al-Awsat on Sunday that he had previously warned European diplomats during their meetings, from the threat of playing with terrorists.

Al-Darssi accused Qatar of sabotaging his country and of supporting armed groups at the expense of the National Army.

He also said that several Libyan leaders were disturbed from the Qatari interference in Tripoli's internal affairs.

Saleh Issa said that after amendments are made the accord will be incorporated into the country's constitution, recognizing the Government of National Accord's (GNA) presidential council.

Speaking at a press conference held on Monday after Saleh Issa said that the Libyan parliament requested the amendment of the Skhirat agreement. The presser was held on the sidelines of bilateral discussions held between Saleh Issa and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita in Rabat.

The presidential council must be composed of a single president and two deputies, Saleh Issa said. He also mentioned that the acting prime minister must have power over council assignment, in addition to other points.

For his part, Moroccan FM Bourita called on all Libyan parties to accept the principle of consensus. It was in the interests of the Libyan people, their peace, and the country's unity, the minister said.

Morocco hosted the UN-brokered Libya Dialogue sessions in Skhirat which resulted in the Libyan Political Agreement. Saleh Issa, however, is not wholly in agreement with it.

Since March 2016, the conflict between the two rival governments, the Libyan House of Representatives and the GNA-affiliated General National Congress (GNC), has intensified. Despite previously supporting it, the Libyan House of Representatives withdrew its recognition of the GNA by voting against it in the summer of 2016 and becoming their rival for governing the country.

More so, Bourita said that his country's interest lies in sustaining Libya's stability and unity given the long-standing relations shared between the two countries.

He stressed that Rabat will continue its mediation efforts with all Libyan parties in hopes of bringing conflicting parties closer together.

Bourita pointed out that Saleh Issa's visit to Rabat comes within the framework of many efforts made by Morocco under orders from King Mohammed VI concerning the Libyan file, aiming to establish a political consensus between the Libyans.

For his part, Saleh Issa said that talks with Bourita intensely reviewed the situation in Libya and directed help to Libyan people, as well as provided substantial aid for counterterrorism efforts.

11404337,2017-04-24,"Cairo - Conflicts in the Arab region, most notably in Syria, Libya and Yemen, should be resolved, stressed Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister Sameh Shoukry.

The minister added there is a possibility to contain terrorism through Western intelligence agencies, not just military operations.

Speaking to Asharq al-Awsat, the FM said that certain known factories are providing terrorist organizations with arms and equipment, calling for serious and effective cooperation to end this.

Shoukry pointed out that the US administration shares the same vision as Egypt in countering terrorism. He also discussed the situation in the region and the importance of giving people a chance to end their struggles and solve their problems.

When asked if there were any initiatives for a solution in Yemen, Shoukry replied that they are monitoring the UN envoy and other countries' efforts to establish a resolution according to the agreed bases, such as the outcomes of the national dialogue, the Gulf initiative and supporting the legitimacy.

On terrorism, the FM stressed that Egypt will continue to fight it, especially after the two attacks on the Tanta and Alexandria Churches earlier in April.

Shoukry stated that he believes terrorism is expanding because the international effort that has been established did not succeed in containing terrorism, except in Iraq recently.

He added that the situations in Syria and Libya are complicated and terrorist organizations are spreading in Africa. He also cited the frequent attacks in Europe and Egypt that are evidence of the continued presence of these terror organizations.

According to the minister, the international community should ""credibly tackle the matter because it is impossible that these organizations receive weapons and support unbeknownst to the western intelligence.""

Shoukry said: ""If there a real international will to fight terrorism, then the international community should begin with determining how these terrorist organizations receive all these advanced weapons and equipment.""

The FM said it is ""impossible"" that intelligence agencies are unable to trace and determine the parties and states responsible for backing terrorist organizations. He added that this is crucial for the credibility of anyone who says they are fighting terror.

Commenting on Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi's recent trip to the US, Shoukry explained that it took place shortly after US President Donald Trump came to office and when the US policy was still being shaped.

He did say however certain concepts were agreed upon, like fighting terrorism.

When asked whether Egypt will continue to unite all three Libyan parties, Shoukry stressed that his country never did and never will stop trying to unite Libyan parties. He explained that there are three institutions in Libya: presidential council, the parliament and the state's council, which will form a committee to agree on the amendments needed to the Sukhayrat agreement.

He added that this constant effort with Libyan leaderships, which have met with Egyptian officials in Cairo, will continue until they are successful.

The minister stressed that Egypt aims to have natural relations with regional countries according to certain bases, which include mutual respect for sovereignties.

Furthermore, Cairo does not interfere in internal affairs and does not support organizations that back terrorism.

The FM was in Sudan recently on a visit, which he described as having ""positive outcomes"".

He stated that it was an opportunity to review bilateral relations and the outcomes of the meetings of the joint high committee. He also explained that Egypt and Sudan agreed on a mechanism for political dialogue and discussed the regional situation.

The minister stated that bilateral relations might have had some misunderstandings or misinterpretations, which drove brotherly relations off their track.

When asked if the past has been forgotten, Shoukry stressed that Cairo is committed to a strategic ties with Sudan, which goes beyond any special relationships, adding: ""Egypt does not conspire against or interfere in the affairs of any state.""

On Ethiopia, Shoukry said that both Cairo and Addis Ababa requested better coordination and asked for more frequent meetings. He explained that this could make it clearer to the public that issues are being discussed frankly and openly.

When asked about the Egyptian-Ethiopian relations, Shoukry said that Ethiopian FM Workneh Gebeyehu conveyed his country's prime minister's message to Sisi during his recent visit to Cairo. He added that the visit was an opportunity to discuss the importance of the mutual relations which are based on respect and common interests.

The Ethiopian FM stressed publically that his country will not take any move that could harm Egyptian interests. Meanwhile, Shoukry confirmed that Egypt is concerned with the Ethiopian development efforts, expressing Egypt's willingness to be part of it through investments.

Shoukry said that the two countries agreed on dialogue to reach an ongoing mechanism to hold meetings every two months in order to discuss any misunderstanding or misinterpretation that could lead to wrong assumptions.

11404339,2017-04-12,"Cairo - Armed militiamen attacked the house of Al-Seddiq Al-Kabeer, Governor of the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) in Tripoli. On the other hand, fierce clashes erupted between the Libyan National Army under the command of General Khalifa Haftar and the internationally-backed Government of National Accord headed by Libya Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

Forces aligned with a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli said on Monday that three of their men had been killed in air raids against a desert air base by rivals allied with eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar.

The armed group broke into Kabeer's house in Nufiliyeen area in Tripoli in an endeavor to kidnap the governor, security sources told Asharq Al-Awsat. Perpetrators broke and entered the household holding the governor's family members hostage, as well as appropriating some legal documents.

Although the attack targeted Kabeer, the militiamen failed to kidnap the governor since he was not at the household during the time of the theft and kidnap. No party rose to claim responsibility for the attack targeting the official responsible for regulating Libya's national currency.

Footage Asharq Al-Awsat looked into writings on the household's walls demanding the governor's resignation.

Kabeer was said to be in Malta on Monday when his house came under attack, he attended a Valletta meeting on Friday between the governors of the European Central Banks and the Governors of the North African and Mediterranean Banks, the CBL official website reported.

They discussed during the meeting the experiences of these countries in the role of monetary policy and the framework of financial policies under the current regional and global economic conditions.

CBL employees issued a statement condemning the attacks and saying they was part of a series of systematic jabs seeking to down the national bank and undermine public institutions.

Since 2014, loose and shifting military alliances based in the east and west of Libya have been engaged in a stop-start conflict which the GNA has been unable to resolve.

The oil-producing North African state slipped into turmoil during the 2011 uprising that ended Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year-old and has been riven by factional strife since then.

The struggle for control around Tamanhent air base 30 km (19 miles) northeast of Sabha risks escalating into a major confrontation between forces officially linked to the Government of National Accord (GNA) and Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).

Haftar is aligned with an eastern parliament and government that have spurned the GNA since it arrived in the capital Tripoli, in the far west of the country, a year ago.

His forces have been extending their reach along Libya's central Mediterranean coastline and into the desert regions of Jufra and Sabha, and say they also intend to take control of Tripoli.

After an LNA strike against Tamanhent last week the GNA warned of the risk of civil war and said it was mobilizing forces to repel the attack.

Tamanhent is controlled by a force from Misrata, a militarily powerful western city that has backed the GNA. Air strikes on Monday killed three men stationed there and wounded at least one more, according to Mohamed al-Gasri, a spokesman for the defense ministry in Tripoli.

An eastern military source said there had also been ground clashes around Samnu, about 50 km northeast of Sabha. A medical source in Sabha said three LNA troops had been killed.

Jordan (Dead Sea)- Diplomatic sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Amman Declaration, to be issued by the end of the Arab summit, will demand the international community to commit to the natural norms of legitimacy regarding the status of Jerusalem, and to consider the transfer of any country's embassy to it a violation on international laws and resolutions. As well as a loud transgression against the rights of the Palestinian people.

""The declaration will call Arab leaders of all States to commit to United Nations Security Council resolutions 476 and 478 issued in 1980, and international law, which considers the Israeli law to annex Jerusalem null and void as well as deploying diplomatic missions or the transferring of embassies there,"" sources said.

The Amman declaration is expected to reaffirm the commitment of Arab states to the Palestine peace initiative and the need to reach a political settlement which leads to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as a capital.

The declaration will ""back the constitutional legitimacy in Yemen embodied in the government internationally recognized and led by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi,"" sources said.

More so, the statement will support the finding of a peaceful solution for Yemen as well as calling upon the international community and all human rights organizations to take a quick and firm stance on coup violations.

As for the foreign feeding into regional strife, the declaration will condemn ""the continued Iranian interference in the internal affairs of a number of Arab countries, calling on Tehran to act in accordance with principles of good neighborliness, withdrawing any military forces from any Arab state territory.""

It will also call on the ""the international community represented by the Security Council to pressure Tehran to halt its hostile activities.""

Arab leaders will corroborate their support of Libya's political agreement signed in the Moroccan Skhirat in 2015, which backs the Government of National Accord (GNA) as the sole legitimate authority in Libya.

Any foreign interference of any kind in Libyan affairs will be rejected, unless it was upon the GNA's request and in coordination with its bodies.

As for the ongoing Syria crisis, the declaration will state that ""the single solution for Syria is a political one"" and will include an Arab commitment to support countries hosting Syrian refugees.

The Declaration focuses on ""safeguarding Arab national security and fighting terrorism,"" given the unprecedented security challenges and shifts facing the Arab region. It will stress ""the importance of enhancing Arab joint action to maintain national security, defend the independence of Arab states, protect national sovereignty, and combat both terrorism and organized crime.""

On that note, the declaration will promote the organization of a periodic Arab-European summit. Arab leaders will urge Jordan and the League of Arab States to hold discussions and coordinate with EU countries for materializing such an effort.
